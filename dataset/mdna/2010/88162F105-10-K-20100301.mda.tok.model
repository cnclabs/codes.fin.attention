item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations and have adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview despite a decrease in consolidated revenues during compared to the prior year  our overall profitability increased  primarily due to the unprecedented favorable performance of our offshore services segment  a favorable insurance litigation settlement  and due to significant impairments to oil and gas properties and goodwill during the demand for diving  platform decommissioning  cutting  and abandonment services continued to be strong during the year following the damage to offshore platforms from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in prior years and due to the risk of damage from future storms 
this increased demand plus the additional efficiencies resulting from high utilization and optimal weather conditions during most of significantly benefitted the offshore services segment 
we expect demand for these services to continue to be robust in maritech s revenues decreased during due to lower oil and gas pricing compared to  despite having a large portion of the impact of decreased pricing offset by maritech s oil and gas hedge contracts 
in addition  maritech s oil and gas production volumes decreased compared to the prior year due to the reduction in development activities over the past year and due to the continuing impact from hurricane ike in  which shut in production from a significant oil producing field 
despite these decreases in revenue  maritech s profitability increased compared to primarily due to the october settlement agreement with the various parties to our insurance litigation regarding certain costs associated with maritech offshore platforms which were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes katrina and rita during this settlement resulted in approximately million of settlement gain during these increases in profitability were partially offset by the results of our production testing  compressco  and fluids operations  which experienced decreased demand from customers during  resulting in decreased revenues and profitability 
although these operations continue to be affected by the lingering impact of the current global economic environment  we expect modest increases for these operations beginning in as a result of improving oil and gas commodity pricing and rig count levels  which are expected to result in increased activity for our customers 
all of our businesses took steps during to reduce operating and administrative costs through temporary salary reductions  project deferrals  consolidation of locations  and other measures  and intend to continue to seek additional ways to maximize earnings and cash flow going forward 
the current cost reduction efforts also include a focus on improving cash flow and enhancing liquidity through a combination of reducing or deferring capital expenditures and carefully managing working capital 
as a result of these efforts  and despite the difficult market environment for many of our businesses  operating cash flows increased compared to the prior year to approximately million  and investing activities decreased compared to the prior year to million 
during the fourth quarter of we repaid the remaining outstanding balance under our bank revolving credit facility and accumulated approximately million of available cash as of december  these efforts were accomplished despite expending approximately million of capital expenditures and other investing activities during  including million for the continuing construction of our new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant facility  compared to million during the el dorado facility began production during the fourth quarter of and is expected to further increase the fluids division s efficiency in manufacturing its chemicals and completion fluids products  which should strengthen operating cash flows in future years 
in addition  we made significant progress during in the abandonment and decommissioning of many of maritech s offshore oil and gas property assets  expending approximately million 
these abandonment and decommissioning efforts are expected to continue to be significant going forward 
as of december   maritech has remaining decommissioning liabilities of approximately million  including the remaining well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning and debris removal work to be done associated with offshore platforms destroyed by and hurricanes 
in addition to the million proceeds related to our insurance litigation settlement  we also generated additional cash from the liquidation of certain hedge derivative contracts and from sales of certain non strategic assets 
given the expected prolonged economic recovery for certain of our businesses  we plan to continue to review future capital expenditures carefully as we also monitor the expected improvement of our operations 
despite this focus on conserving capital resources  we continue to seek strategic growth opportunities  both through acquisitions and internal growth  which we plan to fund from operating cash flows  and if necessary  from additional long term debt borrowing 
we continue to have availability under our bank revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in june our senior notes are scheduled to mature at various dates from september through april future demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by that industry s level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
industry expenditures  as indicated by rig count statistics and other measures  have recently begun to increase following the significant decline during the past year which was in response to the general uncertainty regarding availability of capital resources in the current economic environment and due to oil and natural gas price volatility 
our overall growth remains hampered by the current decreased industry demand for many of our products and services  although we still believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services in the us and international markets  supported primarily by increases in technologically driven deepwater gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  continued reservoir depletion in the us and the advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  which will drive abandonment and decommissioning work  and increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling clear brine completion fluids cbfs and providing filtration  water transfer  and associated products and engineering services to us and international exploration and production companies 
in addition  the fluids division also provides liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues decreased during compared to the prior year  due primarily to a significant decrease in sales volumes  both of its cbf products and its other manufactured chemicals  primarily due to decreased energy industry demand 
the overall outlook for the division s completion services business is dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or has decreased during the past several years due largely to the maturity of the producing fields in the heavily developed portions of the gulf of mexico 
overall industry drilling activity during was also negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices during much of the year compared to and increased capital constraints as a result of the general economic conditions 
we anticipate modest increases in spending beginning in given the current levels of oil and natural gas prices 
also  the division is attempting to capitalize on the current industry trend toward drilling deepwater wells that generally require greater volumes of more expensive brine solutions 
in addition  we are also pursuing specific international opportunities where industry spending levels from major energy customers and national oil companies have generally been more stable 
during  the fluids division entered into a long term contract with petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras to provide completion fluids for its deepwater drilling program offshore brazil 
although much of petrobras activity associated with this contract was deferred during  we anticipate that activity in brazil will be increasing beginning in to further the growth of the division s manufactured products operation and provide additional internally produced supply for our completion fluids operations  in we began construction of a new calcium chloride plant facility located near el dorado  arkansas 
during the fourth quarter of  we began production of liquid calcium chloride at our newly completed calcium chloride plant 
this plant also began production of dry flake calcium chloride during january our offshore division consists of two operating segments the offshore services segment and the maritech segment 
offshore services generates revenues and cash flows by performing downhole and subsea services such as plugging and abandonment  workover  and wireline services  construction and decommissioning services  including hurricane damage remediation  and diving services involving conventional and saturated air diving and the operation of several dive support vessels 
the services provided by the offshore services segment are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us  including offshore  inland waters  and in certain onshore locations 
gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations  the age of producing fields  production platforms and other structures  oil and natural gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
in addition  the segment continues to capitalize on the current demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services in the gulf of mexico  including a portion of the work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by the significant hurricanes that occurred in and given the increasing cost to insure offshore properties  many oil and gas operators are accelerating their plans to abandon and decommission their offshore wells and platforms 
offshore services revenues increased by during primarily associated with the increased utilization  particularly by the segment s diving  abandonment  heavy lift  and cutting services businesses which continue to enjoy high demand following the and hurricanes 
in addition  the segment benefitted from near optimal weather conditions during most of although it expects robust demand for its services to continue  the segment anticipates its overall activity in will decrease from the record levels experienced during  as the remaining hurricane remediation work moves at a less urgent pace and due to an expected return to normal levels of weather disruptions 
through maritech and its subsidiaries  the offshore division acquires  manages  explores  and develops oil and gas properties in the offshore  inland water  and onshore region of the gulf of mexico and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
maritech periodically acquires properties for their exploration and development potential 
during  maritech s operations continued to be hampered by production interruptions from the hurricanes  reduced funding for capital expenditures  and the need to perform significant well intervention and decommissioning efforts 
maritech has five remaining toppled offshore platforms that will require extensive efforts to decommission  and much of this work is planned for maritech s revenues during decreased by compared to  due to decreased overall production and lower oil and gas commodity prices compared to although much of the storm interrupted production has been restored  one of the destroyed offshore platforms served a key producing field  the east cameron field 
although a portion of the production from this field has been restored  the complete restoration of east cameron production will require the reconstruction of the destroyed platform and the redrilling of wells  and these efforts are not expected to be complete until maritech s existing lease portfolio  along with exploitation opportunities on producing leases  should continue to provide maritech with additional attractive development projects  subject to capital expenditure constraints as a result of the current economic environment 
our production enhancement division consists of two operating segments the production testing segment and compressco segment 
the production testing segment generates revenues and cash flows by performing flow back pressure  volume testing  and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served include many of the major oil and gas basins in the united states as well as onshore basins in mexico  brazil  northern africa  the middle east  and certain other international markets 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting drilling and completion activities in the markets which the production testing segment serves 
production testing segment revenues decreased in as compared to  primarily due to decreased demand in the united states 
given the recent increase in oil and natural gas pricing  we expect demand for our production testing services will increase in compared to compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing wellhead compression based production enhancement services throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the united states  as well as basins in canada  mexico  south america  europe  asia  and other international locations 
demand for wellhead compression services is generally driven by the need to boost production in certain mature gas wells with declining production 
compressco segment revenues decreased in as compared to  due to decreased us and international demand for production enhancement services  primarily resulting from decreased natural gas prices 
given the recent increase in oil and natural gas prices  we anticipate compressco s revenues and cash flows will increase compared to  particularly as we also continue to seek new us and international markets for compressco operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectability of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations which we believe are reasonable 
the fair values of large portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and as changes in our operating environment are encountered 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
if an impairment of a long lived asset is warranted  we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows  the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated  as well as the fair value of an impaired asset  are imprecise 
our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long lived assets being overstated  which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present 
alternatively  if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
our estimates of operating cash flows and fair values for assets impaired have generally been accurate 
although we have historically had minimal impairments of long lived assets other than for oil and gas properties see separate discussion below  during we recorded other long lived asset impairments of million 
given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of long lived assets in future periods is higher due to the possibility of further decreased demand for our products and services 
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present but not less than once annually 
the assessment for goodwill impairment is performed for each reporting unit and consists of a comparison of the carrying amount of each reporting unit to our estimation of the fair value of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill 
our estimates of reporting unit fair value are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business estimated fair value 
these estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors  including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment  which affects our overall market capitalization 
if we over estimate the fair value of our reporting units  the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated 
alternatively  if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  due to changes in the global economic environment which affected our stock price and market capitalization  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million 
we believe our estimates of the fair value for each reporting unit are reasonable 
however  given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of goodwill in future periods is higher 
as of december   our offshore services  production testing  and compressco reporting units reflect goodwill in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
the fair values of our offshore services and production testing reporting units significantly exceed their carrying values 
however  because the estimated fair value of our compressco reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately  there is a reasonable possibility that compressco s goodwill may be impaired in a future period  and the amount of such impairment may be material 
specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our compressco reporting unit include the prices received by compressco s customers for natural gas production  the rate of future growth of compressco s business  and the need and timing of the full resumption of the fabrication of new compressco gas jack compressor units 
the demand for compressco s wellhead compression services has been negatively affected by the global economic environment and the decrease in natural gas prices compared to the prior year 
further decreases in such demand could have a further negative effect on the fair value of our compressco reporting unit 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized  and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on an individual field basis  whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
accordingly  maritech s results of operations may be more volatile compared to those oil and gas exploration and production companies who account for their operations using the full cost method 
due to the impact of changing oil and gas prices  results of drilling and development efforts  and increased estimated decommissioning liabilities see discussion below  maritech has recorded oil and gas property impairments and dry hole costs  and during   and these impairment charges were significant 
maritech periodically purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred compared to the estimated amounts recorded will affect our anticipated profitability 
given the current volatility of oil and natural gas prices  we are more likely to record additional significant impairments in future periods 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering  and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could result in significant upward or downward revisions of previous estimates  as reflected in our annual disclosure of the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves 
in previous years  we have reflected revisions to our previous estimates of reserve quantities and values  and in some years  these revisions have been significant 
it is possible we will have additional revisions to our estimated quantities of proved reserves in future periods 
decommissioning liabilities we estimate the third party market values including an estimated profit to the service provider to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and we use these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
these well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities referred to as decommissioning liabilities are recorded net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners  anticipated insurance recoveries  and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the property 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit we earn in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the estimated timing of these cash flows is determined by the productive life of the associated oil and gas property  which is based on the property s oil and gas reserve estimates 
the amount of cash flows necessary to abandon and decommission the property is subject to changes due to seasonal demand  increased demand following hurricanes  and other general changes in the energy industry environment 
accordingly  the estimation of our decommissioning liability is imprecise 
the estimation of the decommissioning liability associated with the five remaining maritech offshore platforms that were destroyed during the and hurricanes is particularly difficult due to the non routine nature of the efforts required 
the actual cost of performing maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning work has often exceeded our initial estimate of maritech s decommissioning liability and has resulted in charges to earnings in the period the work is performed or when the additional liability is recorded 
during and  the amount of charges to earnings as a result of costs in excess of our estimated liabilities has been significant 
to the extent our decommissioning liability is understated  additional charges to earnings may be required in future periods 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration and that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
the estimation of total costs to be incurred may be imprecise due to unexpected well conditions  delays  weather  and other uncertainties 
inaccurate cost estimates may result in the revenue associated with a specific contract being recognized in an inappropriate period 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
despite the uncertainties associated with estimating the total contract cost  our recognition of revenue associated with these contracts has historically been reasonable 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
such estimates of future collectability may be incorrect  which could result in the recognition of unanticipated bad debt expenses in future periods 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies  and historically our estimates of uncollectible receivables have proven reasonably accurate 
however  if due to adverse circumstances  such as in the current economic environment  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required  and such amount may be material 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations  and many of these estimates of future operations may be imprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and  in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired 
our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise  and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  which could result in asset impairments  recording of previously unrecorded liabilities  and other financial statement adjustments 
the difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term 
all of these estimates are inherently imprecise and may result in compensation cost being recorded that is materially different from the actual fair value of the stock options granted 
while the assumptions for expected stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeiture rates are updated with each year s option valuing process  there have not been significant revisions made in these estimates to date

total consolidated gross profit increased to million during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during the prior year 
see the divisional comparisons section below for a discussion of the changes in consolidated revenues and gross profit during compared to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to approximately million of decreased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses  primarily due to overall personnel cost reduction efforts 
this decrease was despite increased incentive bonus and equity compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses were also decreased due to approximately million of decreased office expense  primarily from decreased office rent following the first quarter relocation to our new corporate headquarters building  approximately million of decreased professional fees  and approximately million of decreased marketing  investor relations  and other general expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased insurance and property tax expenses and approximately million of increased bad debt expenses 
despite these net decreases  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to during compared to during the prior year due to decreased revenues 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during the prior year  primarily due to the change in hedge ineffectiveness  as we recognized approximately million of hedge ineffectiveness losses during the current year compared to million of hedge ineffectiveness gains during the prior year 
in addition  earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million  primarily due to an impairment charge of approximately million during associated with the write down of our unconsolidated european joint venture investment 
partially offsetting these decreases  we recorded million of increased net legal settlement income  million of increased gains on sales of assets  and million of increased foreign currency gains during interest expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased to million during compared to million during  despite increased borrowings of long term debt during much of the year  which were used to fund our capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
the decrease was primarily due to million of increased capitalized interest primarily associated with our arkansas calcium chloride plant and corporate headquarters construction projects 
the corporate headquarters building was completed during the first quarter of  and our new calcium chloride facility in el dorado  arkansas  began initial production during the fourth quarter of accordingly  despite a decrease in the balance of long term debt outstanding as of december   our net interest expense is expected to increase beginning in since the amount of interest capitalized will be reduced 
our provision for income taxes during increased to million compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to increased earnings 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to a net loss before discontinued operations of million in the prior year  an increase of million 
net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to a net loss per diluted share before discontinued operations of on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
net loss from discontinued operations was million during compared to million of net loss from discontinued operations during net income was million during compared to a net loss of million in the prior year  an increase of million 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to a net loss per diluted share of on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division our fluids division revenues during were million  a decrease of million compared to million of revenues during the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in product sales revenues  primarily due to decreased sales volumes of completion fluids as a result of the overall decreased demand for the division s brine products 
this decrease reflects the overall decreased industry spending as reflected in the us and international rig counts during compared to and the current trend of many operators to defer completion operations on drilled oil and gas wells 
in addition  the decreased product sales revenues were due to decreased sales volumes of the division s manufactured chemicals products  primarily due to the impact of decreased economic conditions which have affected the level of activity of the division s oil and gas industry customers 
the division also reflected million of decreased service revenues  primarily due to decreased us onshore oil and gas activity 
during the fourth quarter of  the division began initial production of liquid calcium chloride from its el dorado  arkansas  plant facility 
the plant also began initial production of dry calcium chloride in early the division expects that the new facility  along with a general improvement in economic conditions  will contribute to increased revenues beginning in our fluids division gross profit decreased to million during compared to million during the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in division gross profit was primarily due to the decreased sales volumes discussed above  particularly for us completion fluids products 
in addition  the fluids division recorded approximately million of impairments of long lived assets during gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased  however  to during compared to during  primarily due to increased international margins  particularly by the division s european calcium chloride operation 
as discussed above  the division s new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant facility began initial production during the fourth quarter of the division expects that the new plant will result in reduced product costs and increased profitability in the future  particularly once the plant begins to produce at full capacity 
such benefits are expected despite increased raw material costs following the renegotiation of certain terms of our supply contracts with chemtura corporation chemtura pursuant to chemtura s bankruptcy proceedings during the past year 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to a non recurring million charge for the impairment of goodwill recorded during the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by the million decrease in gross profit discussed above and a million charge during associated with the impairment of the division s investment in a european unconsolidated joint venture 
the joint venture ceased operation of the calcium chloride manufacturing plant following our joint venture partner s announced closure of its adjacent plant facility which supplies the joint venture s plant with feedstock raw material 
these decreases in earnings were partially offset by approximately million of decreased administrative expenses and approximately million of increased other income  which was primarily due to a million charge for a legal settlement in the prior year period 
offshore division revenues from our offshore division decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
offshore division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
offshore division income before taxes was million during compared to a loss before taxes of million during the prior year  an increase of million 
the revenues of the division s offshore services operations increased to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to increased utilization  particularly by the segment s diving  abandonment  heavy lift  and cutting services businesses  which enjoyed unprecedented high demand following the and hurricanes 
beginning in june  the segment increased its service fleet through the leasing of a specialized dive service vessel which was utilized for contracted hurricane recovery work during the remainder of the year and is expected to be utilized in early following the current winter season  the offshore services segment plans to continue to capitalize on the anticipated high demand levels for well abandonment and decommissioning services in the gulf of mexico to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties which were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes 
in addition  many offshore oil and gas operators  including maritech  have accelerated their efforts to abandon and decommission offshore platform facilities in response to the risks from future storms and the significantly increased windstorm insurance cost for offshore properties 
many of such operators have discontinued or reduced their windstorm insurance coverage until premium costs decrease or become justifiable and are seeking to maximize their abandonment and decommissioning activity in order to decrease their risk of future damage 
a significant amount of such work is planned for maritech during the offshore services segment of the division reported gross profit of million during compared to million of gross profit during  a million or increase 
the offshore services segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenues was during compared to during the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the increased gross profit of the segment s heavy lift  diving  and cutting services businesses  which generated significant efficiencies from increased utilization during these efficiencies were partially due to improved weather conditions during the current year period  as the segment incurred significant downtime during the third quarter of due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
the hurricane season from june through november can generate significant downtime in certain years 
in addition  heavy seas  winds and winter squalls tend to disrupt activities and  therefore  reduce demand for our services in the first and fourth quarters 
also  during the offshore services segment recorded an million impairment of certain long lived assets 
in addition  during the segment consolidated certain office and administrative functions  reduced crews  and sold or temporarily idled selected inland water equipment in order to increase efficiencies for certain of its operations 
offshore services segment income before taxes increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit described above  and million of decreased administrative expenses  partially offset by approximately million of increased other expense  primarily due to a legal settlement during the third quarter of in addition  the offshore services segment recorded a charge to earnings of million for a goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during compared to million during the prior year  a decrease of million or 
decreased realized commodity prices resulted in million of decreased revenues  as during maritech reflected average realized oil and natural gas prices of barrel and mmbtu  respectively  each of which was lower than levels 
realized oil and natural gas prices during the first quarter of have increased  however  compared to the average prices received during maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future production levels by entering into derivative hedge contracts 
the average realized prices above include the impact of these hedge contracts during  which significantly reduced the impact of decreased prices during the year 
in addition to decreased pricing  decreased maritech production volumes resulted in decreased revenues of approximately million primarily due to one of maritech s key oil producing fields  the east cameron field  being shut in for most of the year 
maritech has restored the majority of the storm interrupted production from east cameron  but will continue to have a portion of its production shut in until a new platform can be constructed to replace a platform which was toppled during hurricane ike 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech installed additional production equipment on the remaining platform in the field in order to restore a portion of the field s production 
the decreased production from normal production declines and the shut in properties more than offset newly added production during the period from wells drilled in and the level of maritech s drilling and development activity has decreased during as a result of our efforts to conserve capital 
partially offsetting the revenue decreases associated with decreased pricing and production volumes  maritech reported million of increased processing revenue during the current year period 
maritech reported gross profit of million during compared to negative gross profit of million during  an increase of million 
this increase was despite the million decrease in revenue discussed above 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues during was 
this increase in gross profit was primarily due to the million of increased insurance related gains  primarily from the million settlement of our insurance litigation regarding claims associated with damage from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the proceeds from this settlement were received during the fourth quarter of in addition  maritech recorded oil and gas property impairments of million during  compared to million during also  maritech recorded million of decreased operating expenses and depreciation  depletion  and amortization during compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased production volumes and reduced insurance premium costs  following maritech s decision to self insure from windstorm damage risk during the last half of the year 
maritech also recorded million of dry hole costs during partially offsetting these expense decreases  maritech recorded million of increased excess decommissioning costs incurred during maritech reported income before taxes of million during  compared to a pretax loss of million during  an increase of million 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit discussed above  approximately million of increased gains on sales of properties recorded  and approximately million of decreased administrative costs  partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income during compared to the prior year 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
production enhancement division gross profit decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
production enhancement division gross profit as a percentage of revenue also decreased from during to during production enhancement division income before taxes decreased during to million compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
production testing revenues decreased significantly during to million  a or million decrease compared to million during this decrease was due to the decrease in us operations  primarily from reduced drilling activity as reflected by the us rig count 
the decreased demand has also resulted in decreased day rates for our services 
the division s production testing segment is particularly affected by the activities of its us customers  many of which have been significantly affected by the current economic climate 
this decrease was partially offset by increased international revenues  primarily in mexico and brazil 
production testing gross profit also decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased from during to during this decrease in gross profit was due to the weaker demand  lower day rates  and decreased activity in the us production testing income before taxes decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit discussed above  which was partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement gain  million of increased gains on sales of assets  and million of increased other income  primarily from increased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture 
compressco revenues during decreased to million during compared to million during  a decrease of million and  reflecting the decreased us demand during most of compared to the prior year 
lower natural gas prices compared to the prior year and general industry economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for wellhead compression services  as reflected in compressco s reduced utilization of its gasjack compressor fleet 
in response to the current economic environment  beginning in early  compressco has slowed its fabrication of new compressor units until demand for its production enhancement services increases and inventories of available units are reduced 
however  compressco continues to seek new niche opportunities to expand its operations  including additional opportunities in international markets 
compressco gross profit decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased from during to during this decrease in gross profit was primarily due to unabsorbed fabrication overhead as a result of the decreased production of new compressor units along with other increased operating expenses for compressco s us operations 
income before taxes for compressco decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the million of decreased gross profit discussed above  partially offset by approximately million of decreased administrative costs and million of increased other income 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during  primarily due to increased administrative expense  depreciation and other expense 
corporate administrative costs increased approximately million  primarily due to approximately million of increased salary and employee expenses 
although corporate employee salary expenses decreased due to cost reduction efforts  these decreases were more than offset by increases in company wide incentive bonus and equity compensation expense 
in addition  corporate administrative expenses increased due to approximately million of increased insurance  taxes  and other general expenses 
these administrative cost increases were partially offset by million of decreased professional services and investor relations expense and million of decreased office expenses  primarily from decreased office rent following the first quarter relocation to our new corporate headquarters building 
in addition to increased administrative expenses  corporate overhead expense increased due to a million change in other income expense during compared to this increase was primarily due to million of hedge ineffectiveness losses included in other expense during compared to million of hedge ineffectiveness gains which were included in other income during in addition  corporate overhead expense increased due to million of increased depreciation expense  primarily due to our new corporate headquarters building 
partially offsetting these increases  corporate interest expense decreased by approximately million during primarily due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized on construction projects during the period 
compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were  million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit increased to million during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during the prior year period 
our profitability during and was significantly affected by several factors  which are discussed in detail in the divisional comparisons section below 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of increased legal and professional services fees  million of increased bad debt expenses  million of increased office expenses  and million of other increased general expenses 
despite approximately million of increased option expense  total personnel costs increased only approximately million  due to decreased salaries  insurance  and other employee related expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were during compared to during the prior year 
impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  changes to the global economic environment resulting in uncertain capital markets and reductions in global economic activity had a severe adverse impact on stock markets and oil and natural gas prices  both of which contributed to a significant decline in our company s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
as part of our annual test of goodwill impairment  we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units  and determined  based on these estimated values  that an impairment of the goodwill of our fluids and offshore services reporting units was necessary  primarily due to the market factors discussed above 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded total impairment charges of million associated with the goodwill impairment for these segments 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  primarily due to approximately million of increased ineffectiveness gains from liquidated commodity derivatives  million of increased equity from earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures  million of increased currency exchange gains  and million from increased gains from sales of long lived assets 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement expensed during the current year and a million legal settlement credited to earnings during interest expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased from million during to million during the current year 
this decrease occurred despite the increased borrowings of long term debt used to fund our capital expenditure and acquisition requirements during and and was due to lower interest rates during the period as well as due to increased interest capitalized associated with our capital construction projects 
interest expense will increase in future periods as these capital construction projects are completed and to the extent additional borrowings are used to fund our acquisition and capital expenditure plans 
our provision for income taxes during increased to million compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to the increased effective state tax rate for certain of our operations and the nondeductible nature of a portion of our goodwill impairments during net income loss net loss before discontinued operations was million during compared to net income of million in  a decrease of million 
net loss per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to net income per diluted share before discontinued operations of on  average diluted shares outstanding during the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments  as this operation was not a strategic part of our core operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
loss from discontinued operations was million during compared to income from discontinued operations of million during  primarily due to the million after tax gain on the sale of the process services operations during the prior year 
net loss was million during compared to net income of million in  a decrease of million 
net loss per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to of net income per diluted share on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues during were million  compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of increased revenues from the sales of manufactured products  particularly in europe  primarily resulting from increased pricing 
in addition  the division reported million of increased service revenues primarily due to increased us onshore service activity as well as the april acquisition of the assets and operations of a company providing fluids transfer and related services in support of high pressure fracturing processes 
these increases were partially offset by decreased brine sales revenues  which declined million due to decreased sales volumes and prices  particularly during the last half of  as many operators were recovering from the third quarter hurricanes 
a large portion of the demand for the division s products and services is affected by the level of drilling activity  including deepwater drilling  particularly in the gulf of mexico region 
this decrease in brine sales  particularly us offshore  is expected to continue during as operators continue to recover from the storms and as overall spending in the oil and gas industry remains decreased due to the current economic uncertainty 
however  during  we entered into a long term contract with petrobras to provide completion fluids for its deepwater drilling program offshore brazil  which should contribute added revenues in future years 
our fluids division gross profit increased to million during  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to during compared to during the prior year 
this increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increased service activity discussed above 
in addition  rainy weather conditions during much of negatively impacted the division s onshore and completion services operations 
the increased raw material costs for certain of our manufactured products were largely offset by decreased brine costs 
a favorable long term supply for certain of the division s raw material needs has been secured  and the division has begun to reflect lower product costs as a result 
in december  the division terminated its remaining purchase commitment under its previous supply agreement in consideration of its agreement to pay million  which was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to an impairment of the division s goodwill for million during the fourth quarter of  which more than offset the million increase in gross profit discussed above 
in addition  the division reported approximately million of decreased administrative expenses and approximately million of increased other income  as a million charge for a legal settlement and million of decreased gains on asset sales were more than offset by million of increased foreign currency gains and million of increased earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures 
offshore division the revenues of our offshore division decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
offshore division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during  an increase of million or 
offshore division loss before taxes was million during compared to a million loss before taxes during the prior year  a decrease of million 
the division s offshore services operations revenues decreased by to million during compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
excluding intercompany work performed for maritech  offshore services revenues decreased by million  or 
decreased heavy lift capacity as compared to the prior year resulted in approximately million of decreased segment revenue  as the offshore services segment had two additional leased vessels operating during a portion of in addition  the division s operations were plagued by poor weather throughout much of due to three named storms in addition to hurricanes gustav and ike  resulting in disruptions to the division s planned activities 
these decreases were partially offset by increased diving and cutting services  which have particularly increased following the hurricanes which occurred during the third quarter of the division aims to capitalize on the current and expected demand for well abandonment  decommissioning  diving  and other service activity in the gulf of mexico  including the work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes in and the offshore services segment of the division reported gross profit of million during  a million decrease compared to million during offshore services gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased to during compared to during the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the million impairment of certain long lived assets during in addition  the segment experienced significant decreases in abandonment and decommissioning activity as a result of the reduced heavy lift capacity and weather disruptions throughout the year 
weather resulted in a postponement of several projects throughout the year  resulting in reduced efficiency and profit for these projects 
these decreases more than offset the operating efficiencies of our dive services business  which generated significant efficiencies from high utilization  particularly following the third quarter hurricanes 
in addition  during the offshore services segment charged approximately million to operations related to a contested insurance claim 
intercompany profit on work performed for maritech s insured storm damage repairs is not recognized until such time as the associated insurance claim proceeds are collected by maritech 
during  insurance claim collections related to intercompany work performed in for maritech contributed to the recognition of an additional million of division intercompany gross profit 
the offshore services segment s income before taxes decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit described above and due to a million charge for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of in addition  other income decreased by approximately million  primarily due to a legal settlement received during the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by a million decrease in administrative expenses 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
as a result of hurricane ike during the third quarter of  maritech suffered damage to many of its offshore production platforms and third party pipelines and facilities  which caused many of its producing properties to be shut in during much of the last four months of three offshore platforms and one inland water production facility were destroyed by hurricane ike  one of which served a key producing field 
these destroyed platforms are in addition to the three offshore platforms destroyed by hurricanes during much of maritech s daily production is processed through neighboring platforms  pipelines  and processing facilities of other operators and third parties  many of which were also damaged during the storm 
as a result  a portion of maritech s production remains shut in 
due primarily to the impact of these storms and despite increased gas production as a result of successful exploitation and development activities and from the acquisitions of properties over the past two years  overall equivalent barrel production volumes decreased during compared to the prior year  resulting in million of decreased revenues 
this decrease was largely offset by million of increased revenue from higher oil and natural gas prices for much of compared to the prior year 
however  beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into  oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly 
maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future production levels by entering into derivative hedge contracts  with certain contracts extending through in addition to the impact from decreased production volumes and increased prices  maritech revenues also increased million during compared to the prior year  due to increased platform processing revenues 
the full resumption of maritech s pre storm production levels may never occur and will depend on the extent of damage and the repairs or reconstruction needed on certain assets 
in addition  while maritech plans to continue to replace its depleting oil and gas reserves through development activities  the amount of such expenditures must now be evaluated more critically in light of the current lower price environment and our need to conserve capital 
the division s maritech operations reported a negative gross profit of million during compared to million of negative gross profit during  a decrease in the amount of loss of million or 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased during the current year to a negative compared to a negative during the prior year 
this increase occurred despite the segment s decrease in revenues during the current year  due to the decreased amount of oil and gas property impairments during compared to maritech recorded million of impairments during  primarily due to the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries as a result of certain future well intervention and debris removal costs being contested by our insurance provider 
this decrease in anticipated insurance recoveries further reduced maritech s gross profit associated with certain hurricane damage repair costs incurred and resulted in a million charge to operating expense  as the timing and amount of the reimbursement of these costs had become indeterminable 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech filed a lawsuit against certain of its insurance underwriters related to certain contested well intervention and debris removal costs incurred and to be incurred on three offshore platforms which were destroyed by hurricanes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  maritech recorded a total of million of oil and gas property impairments  primarily due to decreasing oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  maritech s gross profit increased during due to million of decreased excess decommissioning and abandoning costs 
the increased gross profit was partially offset by million of increased depreciation and depletion expense and million of increased dry hole costs 
in addition  maritech s insurance costs decreased by million during compared to the division s maritech operations reported a loss before taxes of million during compared to a million loss before taxes during the prior year  a million decrease in the amount of loss 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in negative gross profit and approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to gains on sales of properties  partially offset by million of increased administrative costs compared to the prior year 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased significantly from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
production enhancement division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
production enhancement division income before taxes was million during compared to million of income before taxes during the prior year  an increase of million or production testing segment revenues increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of revenues from increased us demand  where activity levels were high throughout despite decreased oil and natural gas pricing during the last portion of the year 
approximately million of the increased production testing revenues were also attributed to increased activity in mexico and brazil 
these increases were partially offset by million of decreased environmental service fees compared to the prior year 
production testing gross profit increased million during compared to  increasing from million to million during  an increase of 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly  however  from during to during the increased gross profit reflected the higher level of activity throughout  particularly for the segment s international operations 
production testing reported income before taxes of million during  compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to the increased gross profit discussed above and million of decreased other expense  primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative costs 
the division s compressco segment revenues increased by approximately million during compared to the prior year  increasing from million during to million during the majority of this increase occurred in the united states  however  compressco s operations in mexico also increased significantly compared to the prior year 
compressco continued to add to its compressor fleet throughout to meet the growing demand for its services 
compressco s gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or  primarily due to increased activity 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased  however  from during to during  primarily due to increased operating costs for its us operations  despite increased strong margins on the growing mexican operations 
income before taxes for the compressco segment increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the million of increased gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative costs and million of increased other expense 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead decreased by million from million during to million during due to million of increased other income  primarily from increased ineffectiveness gains on liquidated derivative contracts  which resulted in million of other income 
these gains were partially offset by approximately million of increased corporate administrative costs and million of increased depreciation expense 
the increase in corporate administrative costs was primarily from million of increased personnel costs  primarily from increased stock option expense  approximately million of increased legal and professional fees  and approximately million of increased general expenses 
net corporate interest expense decreased approximately million due to lower interest rates and additional amounts of interest capitalized associated with our capital construction projects 
the increased capitalization of interest will continue until our significant capital construction projects are completed  which is expected to occur later during liquidity and capital resources during the past year  we have specifically focused on conserving capital resources  even while completing the largest construction project in our history 
this focus has been accomplished by reducing or deferring other capital projects  reducing operating and administrative costs  maximizing operating efficiencies  idling or disposing of non strategic assets  and carefully managing working capital 
these efforts  along with the strong performance of our offshore services segment during the year  have more than overcome the decrease in revenues and operating cash flows from many of our other businesses and have resulted in increased consolidated operating cash flows during compared to cash generated during the year was used to pay the remaining outstanding balance of our bank revolving credit facility and to increase our cash on hand as of yearend 
we have historically funded the majority of our capital expenditure requirements through operating cash flows 
we are continuing to conserve capital spending going forward  as we monitor the operating cash flows of each of our businesses 
while focusing on these efforts  we also continue to seek opportunities for growth  particularly internationally  either through strategic expansion of existing businesses in niche markets or through suitable acquisitions 
our increased liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in june  positions us to take advantage of growth opportunities 
during  cash flows from operating activities increased to million  compared to million during  and funded million of net investing activities  paid down million of long term debt and other financing activities  and increased cash on hand by approximately million 
operating activities cash flow generated by operating activities grew to million during compared to million during and was primarily due to increased earnings  collections of accounts receivable  and other working capital changes 
contributing to the increased earnings was the operating results generated by our offshore services segment and the fourth quarter collection of a million maritech insurance litigation settlement 
in addition  during we generated million from the liquidation of certain oil swap derivative contracts 
the increase in operating cash flows occurred despite a significant increase in the amount of maritech decommissioning activity performed during  and we plan to perform a similar level of decommissioning work in operating cash flows also increased despite the decreased demand for many of our products and services  as cost reduction efforts and improved operating efficiencies partially offset these decreases 
for maritech  the remaining shut in production resulting from damage suffered in from hurricane ike and the reduction in drilling projects during the past year continue to negatively affect the level of maritech s oil and gas production cash flows 
in addition  the oil and gas prices received for maritech s production were also decreased compared to the prior year  although swap derivative hedge contracts partially offset this decrease 
one of the most significant uncertainties regarding the level of our operating cash flows in and beyond  in addition to the factors discussed below associated with our maritech operations  is the timing and magnitude of the continuing global economic recovery and its impact on oil and gas industry activity 
the demand for a large portion of our products and services is driven by oil and gas drilling and production activity generally 
our production testing and compressco segments  along with the completion fluids and services business of our fluids division  have been particularly affected by the decrease in industry activity during the past year  as reflected in the revenue and profitability levels for these segments during oil and gas prices and rig count activity levels have been increasing during the last half of and during the first portion of however  the overall demand for our products and services is also driven by spending levels within the oil and gas industry  particularly domestically  which is also affected by the availability of capital and general economic conditions 
while we expect that the level of revenues and cash flows for our production testing  compressco  and fluids segments will improve modestly in  such levels are expected to continue to be significantly below the levels generated during the first half of our operating cash flows continue to be affected by the impact from hurricanes 
during  hurricane ike caused damage to certain of our properties  including damage to many of maritech s offshore production platforms  three of which were destroyed 
including the platforms and facility destroyed by hurricanes katrina and rita during  one of which was decommissioned during  maritech has five remaining destroyed platforms and associated wells on which it needs to perform well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  debris removal  platform construction  and well redrilling 
we estimate the cost to perform this remaining work will be approximately to million 
approximately to million of this amount has been accrued for as part of maritech s decommissioning liability 
approximately to million of these amounts relate to platforms destroyed by hurricane ike  and we anticipate that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by insurance 
see further discussion below 
during  we charged approximately million of damage repair costs from hurricane ike to earnings and as of december   we reflect an insurance receivable of approximately million for the portion of the costs incurred  including non hurricane related claims  that are covered by our various insurance policies 
although a significant portion of the insurance reimbursements associated with hurricane ike damage costs expended to date was received during and early  the timing of the collection of additional reimbursements is beyond our control 
also related to hurricane ike  one of the destroyed offshore platforms served the east cameron field  which produced approximately of our pre storm oil production 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech modified one of the remaining platforms in this field and has restored a portion of the interrupted production 
the full resumption of production from the east cameron field will require the construction of a new platform and several wells to be redrilled  and these efforts are estimated to cost approximately to million  before insurance recoveries  and are not scheduled to be completed until beginning in june and for the period ending may  maritech discontinued its insurance coverage for windstorm damage due to the current high premium cost of insurance and the reduced levels of coverage 
this decision resulted in increased operating cash flow during the last half of as a result of lower premium costs 
if maritech elects to continue to self insure for windstorm damage in future periods  it will be exposed to losses from future uninsured windstorm damages 
depending on the severity and location of the storms  such losses could be significant 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the timing and amount of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
the third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability as of december  totals million million undiscounted 
these amounts include the well intervention  decommissioning  and debris removal efforts associated with five remaining destroyed offshore platforms  including the three platforms destroyed by hurricane ike 
approximately million of the cash outflow necessary to extinguish maritech s decommissioning liability is expected to occur during the remainder of maritech s decommissioning liability is expected to be extinguished in future years  as reserves are depleted 
the amount and timing of these cash outflows are estimated based on expected costs  as well as on the timing of future oil and gas production and the resulting depletion of maritech s oil and gas reserves 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates  mms requirements  commodity prices  revisions of reserve estimates  and other factors 
the estimated cost to perform the work on the five remaining destroyed platforms and associated wells is particularly imprecise due to the unique nature of the work to be performed 
maritech s decommissioning liability at yearend includes million of adjustments made during relating to future work to be performed which were capitalized to the associated oil and gas properties 
additional adjustments of approximately million were primarily related to work performed on certain properties during the year in excess of the property s decommissioning liability and were charged to earnings 
maritech s estimated decommissioning liabilities are net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners  contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties  and insurance recoveries 
in some cases  the previous owners of acquired properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  partially offsetting maritech s future obligation expenditures 
maritech s decommissioning liability is net of approximately million of amounts contractually required to be reimbursed to maritech 
although we anticipate that a majority of the well intervention  decommissioning  and debris removal costs associated with destroyed offshore platforms from hurricane ike will be reimbursed by insurance  only costs that are similar to the costs that were reimbursed by our insurers following hurricanes katrina and rita have been recognized as an insurance recovery partially offsetting maritech s estimated decommissioning liabilities  and this amount is approximately million as of december  as of december   and prior to the impact of contractually required reimbursements and insurance recoveries  maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s total liability of million  plus approximately million of such future reimbursements and recoveries 
future operating cash flow will continue to be affected by the oil and gas prices received for maritech s production 
to minimize the risk of fluctuating oil and gas prices  maritech enters into oil and natural gas swap derivative transactions that are designated to hedge a portion of maritech s oil and gas production 
maritech s natural gas swap derivative contracts result in maritech receiving a fixed price for hedged natural gas production that is in excess of prices currently being received 
although a majority of maritech s production is currently hedged  these hedge contracts expire at the end of investing activities during  we expended approximately million of cash for capital expenditures and an additional million on purchase consideration adjustments on acquisition transactions from prior years 
approximately million of the capital expenditures was spent on the construction of our new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant facility  which began production of liquid calcium chloride during the fourth quarter of the plant began production of dry calcium chloride during the first quarter of and is expected to begin sodium chloride production in the construction phase of the plant was substantially complete as of december  at a total cost excluding capitalized interest of approximately million  making it the most significant construction project in our history 
during  capital expenditures associated with the el dorado plant represented of our total capital expenditures  as many of our other investment projects were either cancelled or deferred pending the completion of the plant 
as a result  despite the continuing plant construction costs during the year  our total cash capital expenditures decreased by compared to going forward  our capital expenditure plans will continue to be reviewed carefully in light of the current capital market constraints and the continued reduced demand and operating cash flows for several of our businesses 
during  our cash capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million of which was expended by our fluids division  primarily for the construction of the el dorado plant facility  but also including improvements and expansion of fluids and chemical plant facility locations 
our offshore division expended approximately million  consisting of approximately million of exploration and development expenditures for maritech 
in addition  the offshore division also expended approximately million for the offshore services segment  primarily related to vessel and equipment refurbishments for its diving and heavy lift operations 
our production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million to replace and enhance a portion of the testing equipment fleet by our production testing segment 
in addition  compressco spent approximately million for general infrastructure needs along with minimal expansion of its compressor fleet 
our total capital expenditures also included approximately million of corporate capital expenditures  primarily related to the final construction phase of our new headquarters office building  which was completed in the first quarter of generally  a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses  however  certain of these expenditures may be postponed or cancelled in our efforts to conserve capital 
we plan to expend over million on total capital expenditures during  and while this represents a further decrease in total capital expenditures compared to  it would result in increased spending for each of our business segments other than our fluids division 
many of our capital expenditure plans will be deferred until activity levels increase 
deferral of certain capital projects  such as the replacement or upgrading of vessels in our offshore services fleet  could affect our ability to compete 
this restraint on capital expenditure activity may also affect future growth 
in particular  prior to  we had invested significantly in maritech acquisition and development activities  and the current reduction in spending may result in negative growth for maritech over time as a result of postponing the replacement of depleting oil and gas reserves and production cash flows 
however  our long term growth strategy continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions 
to the extent we consummate a significant acquisition  our liquidity position will be affected 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital 
bank credit facilities we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  pursuant to a credit agreement which was amended in june and december the credit agreement 
as of december  and february   we did not have any outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  and had million in letters of credit and guarantees against the million revolving credit facility  leaving a net availability of million 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in june  is unsecured  and is guaranteed by certain of our material us subsidiaries 
borrowings generally bear interest at the british bankers association libor rate plus to  depending on one of our financial ratios 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on unused portions of the facility 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and other restrictions  including certain financial ratio covenants involving our levels of debt and interest cost compared to a defined measure of our operating cash flow over a twelve month period 
in addition  the credit agreement includes limitations on aggregate asset sales  individual acquisitions  and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures 
access to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our ability to continue to comply with the certain financial ratio covenants set forth in the credit agreement  as discussed above 
significant deterioration of the financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances under the facility prior to the credit agreement also includes cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness greater than a defined amount 
if any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner  a default will occur under the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a covenant that restricts us from paying dividends in the event of a default or if such payment would result in an event of default 
we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our credit agreement as of december  our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants centers largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow 
historically  our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants  and subject to the duration of the current economic environment  we expect this trend to continue 
senior notes in september  we issued  and sold through a private placement  million in aggregate principal amount of series a senior notes and million euros approximately million equivalent at december  in aggregate principal amount of series b senior notes pursuant to a master note purchase agreement 
the series a senior notes and b senior notes were sold in the united states to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the securities act of net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of existing indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and to fund the acquisition of our european calcium chloride assets 
in april  we issued  and sold through a private placement  million in aggregate principal amount of series a senior notes pursuant to our existing master note purchase agreement dated september  as supplemented as of april  the series a senior notes were sold in the united states to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the securities act of net proceeds from the sale of the series a senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the existing indebtedness under the bank revolving credit facility 
in april  we issued  and sold through a private placement  million in aggregate principal amount of series a senior notes and million in aggregate principal amount of series b senior notes collectively the series senior notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated april  the series senior notes were sold in the united states to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the securities act of a significant majority of the combined net proceeds from the sale of the series senior notes was used to pay down a portion of the existing indebtedness under the bank revolving credit facility 
the series a senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of and mature on september  the series b senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of and mature on september  interest on the a senior notes and the b senior notes is due semiannually on march and september of each year 
the series a senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of and mature on april  interest on the a senior notes is due semiannually on april and october of each year 
the series a senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of and mature on april  the series b senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of and mature on april  we may prepay the senior notes  in whole or in part  at any time at a price equal to of the principal amount outstanding  plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole prepayment premium 
the senior notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries 
the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement  as supplemented  contain customary covenants and restrictions and require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including a minimum level of net worth and a ratio between our long term debt balance and a defined measure of operating cash flow over a twelve month period 
the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement also contain customary default provisions as well as a cross default provision relating to any other of our indebtedness of million or more 
we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions of the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement as of december  upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement  as supplemented  the senior notes may become immediately due and payable  either automatically or by declaration of holders of more than in principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at the time 
other sources in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  we fund our short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  from short term vendor financing and  to a lesser extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
should additional capital be required  we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
however  instability or volatility in the capital markets at the times we need to access capital may affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an indeterminable length of time 
as discussed above  our bank revolving credit facility matures in june and our senior notes mature at various dates between september and april the replacement of these capital sources at similar or more favorable terms is uncertain 
if it is necessary to utilize equity to fund our capital needs  dilution to our common stockholders could occur 
in november  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s that permits us to issue an indeterminate amount of securities including common stock  preferred stock  senior and subordinated debt securities  warrants and units 
such securities may be used for working capital needs  capital expenditures  and expenditures related to general corporate purposes  including possible future acquisitions 
in may  we filed a universal acquisition shelf registration statement on form s that permits us to issue up to million of common stock  preferred stock  senior and subordinated debt securities  and warrants in one or more acquisition transactions that we may undertake from time to time 
during the fourth quarter of  we liquidated the swap derivative contracts related to the remainder of maritech s production in exchange for net cash received of approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we liquidated certain swap derivative contracts related to maritech s oil production in exchange for net cash received of approximately million  a large majority of which was used to pay a portion of our outstanding balance of our bank revolving credit facility 
as of december   the market value of our natural gas swap contracts was approximately million 
all or a portion of these contracts are marketable to the corresponding counterparty and could be liquidated in order to generate additional cash 
the liquidation of any of these swap contracts would expose an additional portion of maritech s expected future natural gas production to market price volatility in future periods 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
we purchased million of common stock pursuant to this authorization from through and have made no purchases pursuant to the authorization since then 
we received million  million  and million during  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is defined as any contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not consolidated with us is a party  under which we have  or in the future may have any obligation under a guarantee contract that requires initial recognition and measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for the transferred assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with us 
as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies litigation we are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not reasonably expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements 
insurance litigation through december   we have expended approximately million on well intervention and debris removal work primarily associated with the three maritech offshore platforms and associated wells which were destroyed as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in as a result of submitting claims associated with well intervention costs expended during and and responding to underwriters requests for additional information  approximately million of these well intervention costs were reimbursed  however  our insurance underwriters maintained that well intervention costs for certain of the damaged wells did not qualify as covered costs and certain well intervention costs for qualifying wells were not covered under the policy 
in addition  the underwriters also maintained that there was no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of debris removal associated with these platforms or for other damage repairs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by the property damage section of the policy 
although we provided requested information to the underwriters and had numerous discussions with the underwriters  brokers  and insurance adjusters  we did not receive the requested reimbursement for these contested costs 
as a result  on november   we filed a lawsuit in montgomery county  texas  entitled maritech resources  inc v 
certain underwriters and insurance companies at lloyd s  london subscribing to policy no 
gau and steege kingston  in which we sought damages for breach of contract and various related claims and a declaration of the extent of coverage of an endorsement to the policy 
we also made an alternative claim against our insurance broker  based on its procurement of the august endorsement  and a separate claim against underwriters insurance adjuster for its role in handling the insurance claim 
during october  we entered into a settlement agreement with regard to this lawsuit  under which we received approximately million during the fourth quarter of associated with the august endorsement and well intervention costs incurred or to be incurred from hurricanes katrina and rita 
except for approximately million of proceeds expected to be received in march  no significant additional insurance recoveries of well intervention  debris removal  or excess property damage costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita will be received 
following the collection of these amounts  we have collected approximately million of insurance proceeds associated with damage from hurricanes katrina and rita 
this amount represents substantially all of the maximum coverage limits pursuant to our policies 
we estimate that future well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal efforts related to these destroyed platforms will result in approximately million to million of additional costs  and an estimate of these costs has been accrued for as part of maritech s decommissioning liability 
as a result of the resolution of this contingency  the full amount of settlement proceeds is reflected as a credit to earnings in the fourth quarter of class action lawsuit between march  and april   two putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division against us and certain of our officers by certain stockholders on behalf of themselves and other stockholders who purchased our common stock between january  and october  the complaints assert claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the complaints allege that the defendants violated the federal securities laws during the period by  among other things  disseminating false and misleading statements and or concealing material facts concerning our current and prospective business and financial results 
the complaints also allege that  as a result of these actions  our stock price was artificially inflated during the class period  which enabled our insiders to sell their personally held shares for a substantial gain 
the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages  costs  and expenses 
on may   the court consolidated these complaints as in re tetra technologies  inc securities litigation  no 
cv sd sd on august   lead plaintiff fulton county employees retirement system filed its amended consolidated complaint 
on october   we filed a motion to dismiss the federal class action 
on july   the court issued an opinion dismissing  without prejudice  most of the claims in this lawsuit but permitting plaintiffs to proceed on their allegations regarding disclosures pertaining to the collectability of certain insurance receivables 
between may  and june   two petitions were filed by alleged stockholders in the district courts of harris county  texas  rd and th judicial districts  purportedly on our behalf 
the suits name our directors and certain officers as defendants 
the factual allegations in these lawsuits mirror those in the class action lawsuit  and the claims are for breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  and waste of corporate assets 
the petitions seek disgorgement  costs  expenses  and unspecified equitable relief 
on september   the rd district court consolidated these complaints as in re tetra technologies  inc derivative litigation  cause no 
rd dist 
ct  harris county  tex  and appointed thomas prow and mark patricola as co lead plaintiffs 
this lawsuit was stayed by agreement of the parties pending the court s ruling on our motion to dismiss the federal class action 
on september   the plaintiffs in this state court action filed a consolidated petition which makes factual allegations similar to the surviving allegations in the federal lawsuit 
at this stage  it is impossible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or their impact upon us 
we currently believe that the allegations made in the federal complaints and state petitions are without merit  and we intend to seek dismissal of and vigorously defend against these actions 
while a successful outcome cannot be guaranteed  we do not reasonably expect these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect

in august of  the environmental protection agency epa  pursuant to sections and of the clean water act cwa  served a request for information with regard to a spill of zinc bromide that occurred on the mississippi river on march  we timely filed a response to that request for information in august in january  the epa issued a notice of violation and opportunity to show cause related to the spill 
we expect to meet with the epa soon to discuss potential violations and penalties 
it has been agreed that no injunctive relief will be required 
though penalties have not yet been discussed  it is possible that they will exceed  product purchase obligations in the normal course of our fluids division operations  we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products 
some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement 
other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer 
our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements 
we recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them 
during  we significantly increased our purchase obligations as a result of the execution of a long term supply agreement with chemtura corporation 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our fluids division s supply agreements was approximately million  extending through other contingencies related to its acquired interests in oil and gas properties  our maritech subsidiary estimates the third party fair values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any amounts contractually agreed to be paid in the future by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  previous owners of acquired oil and gas properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as such work is performed 
as of december   maritech s decommissioning liabilities are net of approximately million for such future reimbursements from these previous owners 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt interest on debt purchase obligations decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations operating and capital leases total contractual cash obligations decommissioning liabilities related to oil and gas properties generally must be satisfied within twelve months after a property s lease expires 
lease expiration generally occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices 
the amounts shown represent the undiscounted obligation as of december  amounts exclude other long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that do not have known payment streams 
these excluded amounts include approximately million of liabilities under fasb codification topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlements 
see note f income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of the amounts expected to be paid in represent well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal related to offshore platforms destroyed in the and hurricanes  net of anticipated insurance recoveries 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb published statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification fasb codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
beginning on the effective date of the standard now incorporated into fasb codification subtopic  the fasb codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the fasb codification has become non authoritative 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  in the fasb s view  the issuance of the standard and the fasb codification will not change gaap for public companies  and  accordingly  the adoption of the standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb published sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 fasb codification topic  derivatives and hedging  which requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb codification topic sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  we adopted the new disclosure requirements as of january  in december  the fasb published sfas no 
r  business combinations  incorporated into fasb codification topic  business combinations  which established principles and requirements for how an acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the standard changes many aspects of the accounting for business combinations and applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted this standard as of january  with no significant impact  as there have been no acquisitions during however  the standard is expected to significantly impact how we account for and disclose future acquisition transactions 
in may  the fasb published sfas no 
 subsequent events  fasb codification topic  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  it sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this standard is effective for financial statements for periods ending after june  we adopted this standard as of july   however the standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the sec released its modernization of oil and gas reporting rules  which revise the disclosure of oil and gas reserve information 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves in certain circumstances 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves and require companies to report on the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor  file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserves audit  and report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior twelve month period  rather than year end prices 
these new reporting requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  we adopted these new sec oil and gas reserve rules as of december   however they did not have a significant impact on our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk any balances outstanding under the floating rate portion of our bank credit facility are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates 
we borrow funds pursuant to our bank credit facility as necessary to fund our capital expenditure requirements and certain acquisitions 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
we had no balance outstanding under our bank credit facility as of december  accordingly  as of that date  there are no long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest 
the following table sets forth  as of december   our cash flows for the outstanding principal balance of our long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest and weighted average effective interest rates by their expected maturity dates 
we currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk

in september  we borrowed euros to fund the acquisition of our european calcium chloride assets 
we entered into long term euro denominated borrowings  as we believe such borrowings provide a natural currency hedge for our euro based operating cash flow 
in our european operations  we also have exposure related to revenues  expenses  operating receivables  and payables denominated in euros as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material 
we also have operations in other foreign countries in which we have exposure to the fluctuation between the local currencies in those markets and the us dollar 
we currently have no hedges in place with regard to these currencies 
the following table sets forth as of december  our cash flows for the outstanding principal balances of our long term debt obligations which are denominated in euros 
this information is presented in us dollar equivalents 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by their expected maturity dates 
as described above  we utilize the long term borrowings detailed in the following table as a hedge to our investment in our acquired foreign operations  and  currently  we are not a party to a foreign currency swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to further hedge our currency exchange rate risk exposure 
our exchange rate risk exposure related to these borrowings will generally be offset by the offsetting fluctuations in the value of the related foreign investment

realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such price volatility is expected to continue 
our risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of our oil and gas production 
we are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices for the portion of our oil and gas production that is not hedged 
net of the impact of the crude oil and natural gas hedges as of december   described below  each per barrel decrease in future crude oil prices would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million and each decrease in future gas prices of per mcf would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million 
fasb codification topic  derivatives and hedging  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
as of december  and  we had the following cash flow hedging swap contracts outstanding relating to a portion of our maritech subsidiary s oil and gas production commodity contracts aggregate daily volume weighted average contract price contract year december  oil swaps  barrels day barrel natural gas swaps  mmbtu day mmbtu december  oil swaps  barrels day barrel oil swaps  barrels day barrel natural gas swaps  mmbtu day mmbtu natural gas swaps  mmbtu day mmbtu in january  we entered into an additional cash flow hedging oil swap contract  covering  barrels day from february to december  with a contract price of barrel 
during the second quarter of  we liquidated cash flow hedging oil swap contracts in exchange for cash of approximately million 
each oil and gas swap contract uses the nymex wti west texas intermediate oil price and the nymex henry hub natural gas price as the referenced price 
based upon an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of barrel  the market value of our oil swaps liability at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of oil would result in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability increasing by million 
based on an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of mmbtu  the market value of our natural gas swaps asset at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of natural gas would result in the market value of the combined natural gas derivative asset decreasing by million 
the market value associated with the natural gas swap contracts is reflected as a current asset  and the market value associated with the oil swap contracts is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the market value of our oil swaps asset at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of oil would have resulted in the market value of the combined oil derivative asset decreasing by million 
the market value of our natural gas swaps asset at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of natural gas would result in the market value of the combined natural gas derivative asset decreasing by million
