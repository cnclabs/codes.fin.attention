the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

table of contents critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets  the valuation of goodwill  and the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including estimates of repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in estimates  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
for additional information about our recorded interests  refer to note securitization activity to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item management evaluates the valuation of goodwill on an annual basis and more often if situations or the economic environment warrant it 
in performing these evaluations  managements makes critical estimates to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
such estimates include assumptions used in determining cash flows and evaluation of appropriate market multiples 
for additional information about goodwill  refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement dates 
observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as defined in us gaap  level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
for additional information about our financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value  refer to note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii
