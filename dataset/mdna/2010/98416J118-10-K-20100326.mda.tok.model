item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the section titled risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
potential chapter reorganization 
on march   we and certain of our subsidiaries commenced a solicitation of votes in support of the proposed plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the solicitation was made pursuant to the disclosure statement 
on march   the solicitation period concluded  at which time sufficient votes to accept the plan had been received to implement the plan through a court supervised process  but not the vote required for reorganization without court supervision 
we are currently exploring with our lenders whether an out of court restructuring process is feasible  and we target reaching a decision with respect to whether to pursue an in court or out of court restructuring in the near future 
for the remainder of this potential chapter reorganization section  references to we  our and us mean xerium technologies  inc and those subsidiaries of xerium technologies  inc that would be expected to file for chapter protection 
although we have obtained sufficient votes to obtain confirmation of the plan and may file for chapter with the plan on or before march   there can be no assurance that a chapter filing will occur on such timetable or at all 
for example  as discussed above  we may determine that  based on the number of votes received to accept the plan  there is sufficient lender support to pursue an out of court restructuring of our debt  in which case we may not file for chapter any out of court restructuring would require the approval of all of our lenders  including the swap termination counterparties 
in the event that we choose to pursue a restructuring outside of chapter  we expect that the restructuring would occur under similar economic terms as provided in the plan 
operating in bankruptcy would impose significant risks and uncertainties on our business 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our potential bankruptcy and restructuring for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business and investing in our securities as a result of a chapter filing 
the discussion below regarding our potential chapter filing assumes that we file for chapter protection and that the bankruptcy court confirms the plan in the form that it was accepted pursuant to the solicitation 
there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve the plan in a timely manner  or at all  in which case our restructuring efforts may be delayed or unsuccessful 
at this time it is not possible to predict the outcome of any chapter case or its effect on our business 
background our senior credit facility requires that we satisfy certain operating requirements and financial covenant ratios in order to avoid a default or event of default under the facility 
see credit facility below 
as previously disclosed  we were not in compliance with certain of these covenants for the quarters ended september  and december  to provide us additional time to work with our creditors to find long term solutions to our credit issues  on september   december   january  and february   we obtained waivers with respect to non compliance with the financial covenants of the senior credit facility from our lenders 
additionally  the february  waiver permanently waived the requirement that our audited financial statements for the year ended december  be accompanied by an audit opinion unqualified as to going concern 
in connection with the waiver agreement entered into on september   the company paid aggregate fees to the lenders of approximately million  of which million was paid at the time of the effectiveness of the waiver agreement and approximately million will be paid at the maturity date for the loans under the credit agreement and will accrue interest at the rate applicable to the loans until that time 
in connection with the subsequent three waiver extension agreements  we were required to pay fees to the lenders of approximately million at the time of each extension 
in addition  the waivers have provided that  since september   the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility will bear interest at a rate that is per year in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during that period under the senior credit facility 

table of contents absent the waivers  failure to meet these covenants would constitute an event of default under the senior credit facility 
in addition  we anticipate that we will have insufficient cash to both make our required quarterly payments under the credit facility  including the payment due on march   and continue to operate our business 
in the absence of a waiver of such payment  our failure to pay the march  scheduled quarterly principal payment of approximately million when due would constitute an event of default under the credit facility 
our goal is to consummate a financial restructuring transaction  whether in court or out of court  that will significantly reduce our indebtedness and place us in a stronger financial position for future growth and stability 
plan of reorganization if we commence a consensual prepackaged chapter proceeding pursuant to the plan as expected  we will continue to manage our properties and operate our business as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and the orders of the bankruptcy court 
we may pay all debts and honor all obligations arising in the ordinary course of our business after the date of the chapter filing 
however  we may not pay creditors on account of obligations arising before the chapter filing or engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the bankruptcy court 
if we file for chapter protection  directors in certain non us jurisdictions in which we have operations may be required by local law to initiate insolvency proceedings  and creditors in certain foreign jurisdictions may take action under foreign law to seek available remedies 
if we proceed with a chapter filing  on or shortly after the date of such filing we expect to seek authorization from the bankruptcy court to enter into an million dip facility 
the dip facility is intended to fund our working capital needs during the chapter proceeding 
if the dip facility is not approved by the bankruptcy court or if alternative financing is otherwise not available  we may find it necessary to discontinue our operations 
the dip facility commitment expires on april   unless extended 
accordingly  in order to take advantage of the dip facility  it is important that we file for chapter protection in time to obtain court approval of the dip facility prior to the expiration of the commitment 
there is no assurance that we will be able to close the dip facility and  if we do not  we are likely to have insufficient funds to continue our current operations while in bankruptcy 
furthermore  should we decide to pursue an out of court restructuring  we intend to complete the restructuring prior to the expiration of the dip facility commitment 
if an out of court restructuring is not completed by the expiration of the dip facility commitment  we are at risk that we would have insufficient funds to continue our current operations in bankruptcy  should we later file for chapter protection 
the plan provides that on the effective date we will enter into the proposed exit facility  which provides for a revolving loan facility of up to million and a term loan of million to be used to satisfy our outstanding obligations under the dip facility on the effective date and for our ongoing working capital including letters of credit requirements 
the terms of the proposed exit facility are described below  all of our existing common stock  which aggregated  shares outstanding as of march   will be cancelled and we will authorize million shares of new common stock  which is equivalent to a to reverse split of our common stock  our existing credit facility will be amended and restated as the amended and restated credit facility 
the terms of the amended and restated credit facility are described below  our lenders and the swap termination counterparties will receive  among other things  their ratable shares of a million in cash  b million in principal amount of term notes  to be issued pursuant to the amended and restated credit facility  and c of the shares of new common stock to be issued on the effective date prior to dilution  
table of contents the existing holders of our existing common stock will be receive a approximately of the shares of new common stock to be issued on the effective date  and b warrants to purchase up to of the number of issued and outstanding shares of new common stock as of the effective date 
the warrants will be exercisable for a term of four years from the issue date  and the exercise price per share of common stock would be determined in accordance with a formula based on the final amount of allowed claims of the lenders under the credit facility and the swap termination counterparties in the chapter proceeding  and our board of directors will be reconstituted  and will consist of seven directors as follows i our chief executive officer  ii one director nominated by our current board of directors  and iii five directors nominated by certain of our lenders 
the plan also contemplates that we will adopt a new equity incentive plan for compensation of our management and a shareholder rights plan 
we would also enter into registration rights and director nomination agreements with certain of our lenders 
in order for the plan to be confirmed by the bankruptcy court  it must satisfy certain requirements of the bankruptcy code 
confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court would make the plan binding on us  any issuer of securities under the plan  any person acquiring property under the plan and any of our creditors or equity interest holders 
subject to certain limited exceptions  the order confirming the plan generally will discharge us from any debt that arose prior to the date we filed for chapter  and substitutes for such debt the obligations specified under the confirmed plan 
on the date of a chapter filing  we intend to request a series of orders from the bankruptcy court designed to minimize any disruption of business operations 
we anticipate that such requests will include request for authorization to  among other things  satisfy certain pre chapter filing obligations that may be outstanding  including wages and benefits that may be due to employees  as well as obligations to certain vendors  customers and suppliers 
we also intend to request certain orders from the bankruptcy court permitting us to continue  on an uninterrupted basis  our centralized cash management systems and customer service programs 
there can be no assurance that such requests would be granted by the bankruptcy court 
proposed amended and restated credit facility as discussed above  the plan provides that we will enter into the amended and restated credit facility on the effective date that will replace our existing credit facility 
for a discussion of our existing credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility provides for a term loan that has a principal amount of million and that matures on a date that is five years following the closing date of the amended and restated credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries  subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
in addition  most of our us and non us subsidiaries will guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the amended and restated credit facility  provided that non us guarantors will only be liable for obligations of non u 
s borrowers and non us guarantors 
borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility term loans will bear interest as follows in the case of xerium canada inc  at the ba rate plus i if the leverage ratio equals or exceeds or ii if the leverage ratio is less than  in the case of xerium technologies  inc the libor rate plus i if the leverage ratio equals or exceeds or ii if the leverage ratio is less than  and in the case of xti llc  xerium italia spa  huyck wangner austria gmbh and xerium germany holding gmbh  at the euribor rate plus i if the leverage ratio equals or exceeds or ii if the leverage ratio is less than 

table of contents the terms ba rate  libor rate  and euribor rate have the same meanings as set forth in our existing credit facility except that the ba rate  the libor rate and the euribor rate shall not be less than per annum 
interest periods will be   or months 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  then interest on the unpaid balance of the outstanding term loans will accrue at a per annum rate of two percent greater than the rate of interest specified above 
the amended and restated credit facility requires us to make mandatory prepayments under the following circumstances a with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any sale of any assets exceeding  outside the ordinary course of business subject to certain exceptions regarding discontinued manufacturing facilities and exempting the first  b with of insurance and condemnation award payments  subject to certain exemptions  c with cash proceeds from debt issuances  other than certain permitted debt and permitted refinancing debt  and d with of our excess cash after the end of each fiscal year  that is  our adjusted ebitda minus consolidated interest expense  cash income tax expense  consolidated capital expenditures subject to certain exceptions  consolidated restructuring costs  cash payments of withholding taxes from proceeds of the repurchase  redemption or retention of common stock and the aggregate amount of scheduled and voluntary payments made during the past fiscal year 
we expect that the amended and restated credit facility will require that we observe and perform numerous affirmative and negative covenants  which will be based on the covenants set forth in our existing credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility will also require that we observe the following financial covenants  each at levels to be agreed upon interest coverage ratio measured quarterly for a rolling month period  leverage ratio measured quarterly for a rolling month period  and maximum capital expenditures each year 
proposed exit facility as discussed above  the plan provides that we will enter into the proposed facility on the effective date to be used to satisfy our outstanding obligations under the dip facility on the effective date and for our ongoing working capital including letters of credit requirements 
the proposed exit facility provides for a million revolving loan and a term loan that has a principal amount of million 
the revolving credit facility will mature on a date that is three years following the closing date of the proposed exit facility  and the term loans will mature on a date that is four and one half years following the closing date 
the proposed exit facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries  subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
all loans under the proposed exit facility will be senior to the amounts owing under the amended and restated credit facility 
in addition  most of our us and us subsidiaries will guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the amended and restated credit facility  provided that non us guarantors will only be liable for obligations of non u 
s borrowers and non us guarantors 
we will be able to elect whether the loans under the proposed exit facility are eurodollar loans or are base rate loans  and this election will determine the rate of interest on the loans 
if the loans are eurodollar loans  the loans bear interest at the annual rate equal to libor plus the applicable margin  with a libor floor of per annum 
base rate loans bear interest at the annual rate equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is set at per year with respect to eurodollar loans and per year with respect to base rate loans 
the base rate is a fluctuating interest rate equal to the highest of a the prime rate of an agreed upon financial institution  b the federal funds effective rate plus one half of  and c libor plus  with a libor floor of 

table of contents interest periods will be   or months 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  then interest on the unpaid balance of the outstanding proposed exit facility loans will accrue at a per annum rate of two percent greater than the rate of interest specified above 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing under the proposed exit facility  each eurodollar loan will convert to a base rate loan at the end of the interest period then in effect for such eurodollar loan 
the proposed exit facility will require us to make mandatory prepayments under the same circumstances as with respect to the new credit facility  which are described above 
in addition  we expect that the proposed exit facility with require that we observe and perform the same affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants  as required by the proposed new credit facility 
going concern assumptions the consolidated financial statements included in this form k have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
the factors described above and herein  including within item  a  and item of this document  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  and therefore  we may be unable to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business 
these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty  including those relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts nor to the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
recent developments nyse as previously disclosed in our press release dated november   we were notified by nyser on november  that we were not in compliance with the continued listing criteria of the nyse  under section c of the nyse listed company manual 
specifically  the nyse considers us to be below these criteria because the average closing price of our common stock was less than per share over a consecutive trading day period 
this notification represents the second instance that we were not in compliance with this criterion during the past twelve months 
on december   we were first notified by nyser that  in addition to not being in compliance with this criterion  we also were not in compliance with continued listing criteria under section b of the listed company manual because our average total market capitalization was less than million over the same consecutive trading day period and our most recently reported stockholders equity was less than million 
in february  the nyse submitted to the sec an immediately effective rule filing that reduced these amounts to million  respectively 
we cured the first instance of noncompliance under the share price listing standard  which represented the end of the six month cure period prescribed by nyse rules 
in february  we submitted a plan advising the nyse of definitive actions we have taken  or proposed to take  that would bring us into compliance with the market capitalization listing standards within months of receipt of the initial letter which is june  we continue to provide the nyse with quarterly updates to this submitted plan 
such quarterly updates include detailed commentary and description of the actions we are taking with our lenders in order to resolve the financial covenant non compliance under our senior credit facility for the periods ended september  and december   which was waived through april  we believe that the covenant noncompliance negatively affected our share price and market capitalization 
nyser is reviewing the second instance of noncompliance under the share price standard in connection with its broader assessment of our progress on this previously submitted month business plan in order to determine the appropriate action concerning us 
nyser is continuing to monitor and assess the situation with us 
depending on the circumstances  nyser could truncate the procedures outlined in section c that 
table of contents would otherwise be applicable to companies that are not in compliance with the share price standard or it may initiate suspension or delisting procedures against us 
additionally  nyser may also take accelerated listing action in the event that our common stock were to trade at levels deemed to be abnormally low over a sustained period of time or in the case of other material adverse developments 
we may file voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on or before march  section d of the nyse listed company manual provides that the nyse will ordinarily initiate suspension and delisting procedures with respect to any company that has filed for bankruptcy while not in compliance with continued listing standards  unless such company is profitable  has positive cash flow  or is demonstrably in sound financial health despite the bankruptcy proceedings 
we have been in discussions with nyser regarding our financial status  listing status and our potential chapter filing  and will seek to continue the nyse listing of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that the nyser will not take delisting actions against us notwithstanding our efforts  and thus there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to be listed on the nyse 
goodwill impairment as of december   we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million related to our roll covers segment based on assessments performed as of that date 
in accordance with topic  we are required to test goodwill at least annually for impairment  which we do each year as of december applying the guidance in topic  we determined that as of december   goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired primarily due to the adverse effect of the company s credit issues and the effects of the current global economic environment 
global economic environment our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
demand for our products could decline if paper manufacturers are unable to obtain required financing or if the economic crisis causes additional mill closures 
during  especially the latter part of the year  the global paper industry experienced a sharp reduction in production levels  caused by the general slowdown in economic activity and related paper consumption during the same period 
the slowdown of production was across all grades of paper production  but most notably in the packaging grades and newsprint 
for packaging grades  demand is directly related to broad manufacturing and transportation activity reduction  while newsprint demand has been increasingly declining over a number of years due to the greater prevalence of electronic media  exacerbated in recent months by a reduction in print advertising 
one of the results of the recent reduction in demand for paper products is that the inventory of paper at the paper makers has increased significantly and production slowdowns  curtailments and idling of paper making machines occurred at a sharply increasing rate beginning in october and continuing into mid recently  however  there has been some abatement in these production declines and very modest improvements in paper and board manufacturers operating rates that have begun to have a positive impact on the demand for some of our products 
while we were successful in reducing the rate of price decreases in for the products we sell to the paper makers and prices have declined less than in  there continues to be price pressure due to our competitors pursuing increased market share at this time of lower overall demand in our market 
overview we are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper clothing and roll covers 
our operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of north america  europe  south america and asia pacific 

table of contents our products play key roles in the formation and processing of paper along the length of a paper making machine 
paper producers rely on our products and services to help improve the quality of their paper  differentiate their paper products  operate their paper making machines more efficiently and reduce production costs 
our products and services typically represent only a small fraction of a paper producer s overall production costs  yet they reduce costs by permitting the use of lower cost raw materials and reducing energy consumption 
paper producers must replace clothing and refurbish or replace roll covers regularly as these products wear down during the paper production process 
our products are designed to withstand extreme temperature  chemical and pressure conditions  and are the result of a substantial investment in research and development and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes 
we operate in two principal business segments clothing and roll covers 
in our clothing segment  we manufacture and sell highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed on a paper making machine 
clothing plays a significant role in the forming  pressing and drying stages of paper production 
because paper making processes and machine specifications vary widely  the clothing size  form  material and function is selected to fit each individual paper making machine and process 
in  our clothing segment represented of our net sales 
our roll cover products provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper sheet in a cost effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer 
roll covers are tailored to each individual paper making machine and process  using different materials  treatments and finishings 
in addition to manufacturing and selling new roll covers  we also provide refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers and manufacture spreader rolls 
additionally  we provide various related products and services to our customers  both directly and through third party providers  as a growing part of our overall product offering through our roll covers sales channels 
in  our roll cover segment represented of our net sales 
in  sales in other industrial applications outside of the paper industry  such as steel  plastics and textiles  accounted for approximately and of the net sales in our clothing segment and roll covers segment  respectively 
we may file a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on or before march  for additional information regarding our potential chapter case  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation potential chapter reorganization 
industry trends and outlook historically  demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis 
generally  and over time  we expect growth in paper production to be greater in asia  south america and eastern europe than in the more mature north american and western european regions where demand may potentially decline 
the profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper  driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires 
a sustained downturn in the paper industry  either globally or in a particular region  can cause paper manufacturers to reduce production or cease operations  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
since  paper producers have taken actions that seek to structurally improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper 
as part of these efforts  they have permanently shut down many paper making machines or entire manufacturing facilities 
papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability  and we believe that further consolidation among papermakers  reducing the number of paper producers  and shutdowns of paper making machines or facilities will occur in europe and north america  until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve 
this rebalancing has been accelerated during the current global economic recession 
over a number of years  consumption growth of paper  particularly in south america and asia  is expected to drive an increase in 
table of contents the global production rates required to maintain balance between supply and demand 
it is highly likely  however  that a consumption slow down and related effect on global paper production will continue in the near term  exacerbated by the global economic recession 
also affecting machine curtailments are structural productivity gains from improved products that we and our competitors supply 
global paper production growth that does occur would be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity that is a continuing underlying trend in north america and western europe 
we also believe that  in addition to industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north america and western europe  the trend towards new paper machine designs which have fewer rolls and market recognition of extended life of our roll cover products has been and will continue to negatively impact demand for these products and that the volume potential for the roll covers business will slowly diminish 
additionally  we are seeing a trend that paper producers are placing an increasing emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and  as a result  are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them 
we anticipate that pricing pressure for our products will continue with the consolidation among paper producers and as the shift of paper production growth in asia develops 
in response to this pricing pressure  we expect to increase our expenditure levels on research and development expenses and continue to develop our value added selling approach as part of our strategy to differentiate our products  while at the same time remaining focused on cost reduction and efficiency programs 
the negative paper industry trends described above are likely to continue 
we believe that in the current economic environment  the paper industry will experience reduced demand  increased emphasis on cost reduction and sustained paper machine shutdown activity than would have been the case in the absence of the economic crisis 
in addition  the global financial crisis has tightened the availability of credit  which could make it more difficult for our customers to finance their business activities or pay their debts 
thus  the effects of the current global economic environment on the paper industry could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales and expenses sales in both our clothing and roll covers segments are primarily driven by the following factors the volume of worldwide paper production  advances in the technology of our products  which can provide value to our customers by improving the efficiency of paper making machines  our ability to provide products and services which reduce paper making machine downtime  while at the same time allowing the manufacture of high quality paper products  and the impact of currency fluctuations 
sales in our roll covers segment include our mechanical services business 
we have expanded this business in response to demand from paper producers that we perform work on the internal mechanisms of a roll while we refurbish or replace a roll cover 
in our clothing segment  a small portion of our business has been conducted pursuant to consignment arrangements under which we do not recognize a sale of a product to a customer until the customer places the product into use  which typically occurs some period after the product is shipped to the customer or to a warehouse location near the customer s facility 
we are striving to reduce the number of consignment arrangements and increase the use of standard terms of sale under which we recognize a sale upon product shipment 
we expect this effort to be successful over several years 
our operating costs are driven primarily by our total sales volume  the impact of inflation and currency and the level and impact of cost reduction programs 
the level of our cost of products sold is primarily attributable to labor costs  raw material costs  product shipping costs  plant utilization and depreciation  with labor costs constituting the largest component 
we invest in facilities and equipment that enable innovative product development and improve production efficiency and 
table of contents costs 
recent examples of capital spending for such purposes include faster weaving looms and seaming machines with accurate electronic controls  automated compound mixing equipment and computer controlled lathes and mills 
the level of research and development spending is driven by market demand for technology enhancements  including both specific customer needs and general market requirements  as well as by our own analysis of applied technology opportunities 
with the exception of purchases of equipment and similar capital items used in our research and development activities  all research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange we have a geographically diverse customer base 
in  approximately of our sales was in north america  was in europe  was in south america  was in asia pacific and was in the rest of the world 
a substantial portion of our sales is denominated in euros or other currencies 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
in particular  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the euro and these other currencies negatively impact our levels of revenue and profitability because the translation of a certain number of euros or units of such other currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent fewer us dollars 
for certain transactions  our sales are denominated in us dollars or euros but all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in a different currency 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies can affect the level of the profitability of these transactions 
the largest proportion of such transactions consist of transactions in which the sales are denominated in or indexed to us dollars and all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in euros  reals or other currencies 
currency fluctuations have a greater effect on the level of our net sales than on the level of our income loss from operations 
for example  in as compared to  the change in the value of the us dollar against most of the currencies we conduct our business in resulted in currency translation decreases in net sales and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
although the results reflect a period in which the value of the us dollar increased as compared to  we would expect an opposite effect in a period in which the value of the us dollar decreases 
during  we conducted business in foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average exchange rate in and of the us dollar against each of the three foreign currencies in which we conduct the largest portion of our operations  and indicates the percentage of our net sales in and denominated in each such foreign currency 
currency average exchange rate of the us dollar in average exchange rate of the us dollar in euro euro euro brazilian real brazilian real brazilian real canadian dollar canadian dollar canadian dollar currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency euro brazilian real canadian dollar 
table of contents to mitigate the risk of transactions in which a sale is made in one currency and associated costs are denominated in a different currency  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain that results from the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedge strategy 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
due to reduced credit limits at some of our banks  we have been entering into fewer foreign currency hedging arrangements and may not be able to enter into as many hedging arrangements in the future 
as a result  our financial statements are more exposed to the effects of currency fluctuations  both favorable and unfavorable  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
cost reduction programs an important part of our strategy is to seek to reduce our overall costs and improve our competitiveness 
as a part of this effort  we have engaged in a series of cost reduction programs  which were designed to improve the cost structure of our global operations in response to changing market conditions 
these cost reduction programs include headcount reductions throughout the world as well as plant closures that have rationalized production among our facilities to better enable us to meet customer demands 
our cost reduction efforts between and included the closing of twelve manufacturing facilities 
during this same period  as a result of these actions  our headcount decreased by almost individuals during that period  offset by other changes in workforce 
in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i in march  we ceased manufacturing activity at our roll covers manufacturing facility in the united kingdom and recorded restructuring expenses of million related thereto 
we had recorded asset impairment charges of million related to this facility during the fourth quarter of  ii in the first quarter of  we also initiated the closure of a roll covers manufacturing facility in the us for which restructuring expenses and asset impairments of million and million  respectively  were recorded during and iii during the first quarter of  we initiated a program to streamline our operating structure for which restructuring expenses of million were recorded during in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i the streamlining of our operating structure continued during  for which we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   ii the closing of our roll covers manufacturing facility in sherbrooke  canada and the closing our roll covers manufacturing facility in sweden and transferring production to our other roll covers manufacturing facilities in europe were both announced during the second quarter of for which we recorded restructuring and impairment expenses of million during the year ended december   iii our commitment to a plan to cease production in australia and to discontinue construction of our new vietnam facility was announced in december for which we recorded restructuring and impairment expenses of million during the fourth quarter of  and iv our evaluation of assets in the us resulted in impairment charges of million during the fourth quarter of in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i the streamlining of our operating structure continued during  for which we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december  and ii the impairment of approximately million of assets at various locations around the world 
these charges were partially offset by the sale of our rolls manufacturing facility in sweden in the first quarter of at a gain of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we also froze one of our us employee pension plans  terminated our retiree medical plan  
table of contents suspended contributions to our us k program  froze salaries  delayed union contract wage increases  curtailed travel and halted work on our vietnam project 
we target restructuring expenses of approximately million during primarily related to continuing our program of streamlining our operating structure 
we expect to continue to review our business to determine if additional actions can be taken to further improve our cost structure 
in light of our assessment of the impact of the global credit crisis and the potential effect on our customers and our industry  and therefore  on our performance  additional operating structure improvements and related restructuring expenses are being analyzed

our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
demand for our products could continue to decline if paper manufacturers are unable to obtain required financing or if the economic slowdown causes additional mill closures or continued inventory build up 
in addition  the global economic recession and the ensuing lack of credit availability may affect our customers ability to pay their vendors which could have a negative impact on us 
these factors would impact our liquidity and our ability to satisfy the covenant requirements of our credit facility 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly report of form q for the quarter ended september   to provide us additional time to work with our creditors to find long term solutions to our credit issues  on september   we entered into waiver and amendment no

we may request new letters of credit in an amount up to million for equipment purchases and may extend the expiration dates for certain outstanding letters of credit 
the waiver agreement also requires us to report certain additional financial information to the lenders on a monthly basis 
in connection with the waiver agreement  we were required to pay aggregate fees to the lenders of approximately million  of which million was paid at the time of the effectiveness of the waiver agreement and million was deferred to the maturity date for the loans under the senior credit facility and will accrue interest at the rate applicable to the loans until that time

our principal liquidity requirements are for debt service  working capital and capital expenditures 
we plan to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity  but we anticipate that revenues and profits may not generate sufficient cash to fund our operations or meet our other liquidity requirements 
we are not permitted to make additional borrowings under our revolver under the terms of the waiver agreements and we have limited access to other sources of loans 
if we seek reorganization under chapter  we are likely to need immediate access to funding through debtor in possession financing 
while we have executed a commitment letter with a lender willing to provide us with debtor in possession financing  any such financing would require the approval of the bankruptcy court 
if such financing is not approved by the bankruptcy court or is otherwise not available  we may find it necessary to discontinue our operations 
the dip facility commitment expires on april   unless extended 
accordingly  in order to take advantage of the dip facility  it is important that we file for chapter protection in time to obtain court approval of the dip facility prior to the expiration of the commitment 
there is no assurance that we will be able to close the dip facility and  if we do not  we are likely to have insufficient funds to continue our current operations while in bankruptcy 
furthermore  should we decide to pursue an out of court restructuring  we intend to complete the restructuring prior to the expiration of the dip facility commitment 
if an out of court restructuring is not completed by the expiration of the dip facility commitment  we are at risk that we would have insufficient funds to continue our current operations in bankruptcy  should we later file for chapter protection 
also  if we or the directors of our foreign subsidiaries are required to commence insolvency proceedings under the local law applicable in certain of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate  then we may lose access to cash from our operations in those jurisdictions or may lose control of the assets underlying those operations

net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million decrease in as compared with is principally attributable to a decrease in the volume of business as a result of the global economic recession and an increase in working capital during as compared with principally due to the level of payment of payables and accruals during we typically defer payments to certain vendors at the end of each quarter  which results in an increased cash position at the end of the quarter and increased net cash from operating activities for the period then ended 
such deferrals were significant at december  and the reduction of such deferrals at december  contributed to the increase in working capital for the year 
in an effort to improve working capital  in the second quarter of  we initiated a project to accelerate accounts receivable collections and to sell excess inventories 
as of december   our efforts under this project contributed approximately million in additional cash and increased adjusted ebitda by approximately million 
the million decrease in as compared with is principally attributable to a lower net income  after adjusting for non working capital changes  in as compared with this decrease was partially offset by the favorable working capital changes as a result of our continuing efforts to target a reduction in days sales outstanding and increases in inventory turns and days payables outstanding

the decrease of million in as compared with was primarily the result of i borrowings under our revolver of million during the first quarter of  and ii the decrease in other financing activities of million in as compared with related to expenses associated with initiatives undertaken to resolve our credit issues 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net debt payments of approximately million during as compared with we made mandatory principal repayments of million during for as compared with million during for 
the increase in the mandatory payment was due to the loan agreement requiring us to make such excess payments based on the prior year s adjusted ebitda  which was impacted during by gains of approximately million related to the freezing of one of our us pension plans  the termination of our us retiree medical plan and the mark to market changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps  partially offset by approximately million related to increased restructuring expenses and increased noncash reserves

the majority of our capital expenditures relate to purchases of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products 
capital expenditures were funded from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
growth capital expenditures consist of items that are intended to increase the manufacturing  production and or distribution capacity or efficiencies of our operations in conjunction with the execution of our business strategies

in the first quarter of we began an effort to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
as part of this effort  we determined to delay the planned capital expenditures for the vietnam facility and cancelled or rescheduled certain other previously planned capital expenditures 
these cancellations did not result in any substantial penalties for us 
in december  we discontinued the construction of the vietnam facility 
while construction of the vietnam facility has been discontinued  we continue to have contractual obligations with respect to certain equipment which was previously ordered for the facility 
we are redeploying this equipment to other locations 
due to our assessment of the impact of the global economic recession and the potential effect on our customers and our industry  we are currently evaluating further capital expenditures reductions and cost reduction actions to improve long term operating efficiencies and to better match our production with demand 
we target capital expenditures for to be approximately million and estimate capital expenditure levels for to be approximately million 
we analyze our planned capital expenditures based on investment opportunities available to us and our financial and operating performance  and accordingly  actual capital expenditures may be more or less than these amounts

upon the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock on may   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility was amended several times  most recently by the waiver agreement described below 
the credit facility requires that we satisfy certain operating requirements and financial covenant ratios in order to avoid a default or event of default under the senior credit facility agreement 
see further discussion below 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   to provide us additional time to work with our creditors to find long term solutions to our credit issues  on september   we entered into the waiver agreement to the credit agreement 
as of september   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the credit facility

we may request new letters of credit in an amount up to million for equipment purchases and may extend the expiration dates for certain outstanding letters of credit 
the waiver agreement also required us to report certain additional financial information to the lenders on a monthly basis 
in connection with the waiver agreement  we were required to pay aggregate fees to the lenders of approximately million  of which million was paid at the time of the effectiveness of the waiver agreement and million was deferred to the maturity date for the loans under the credit facility and will accrue interest at the rate applicable to the loans until that time 
in addition  during the period between september  and december  the outstanding balance under the credit facility was to bear interest at a rate that was per year in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during that period under the credit facility 
the non default rate was libor  the euribor or cdor rate plus the applicable margin of 
on december  the waiver was extended until february   on january  the waiver was extended until march   and c on february  the waiver was extended until april  additionally  the february  waiver permanently waived the requirement that the company s audited financial statements for the year ended december  be accompanied by an audit opinion unqualified as to going concern 
at each extension date  we paid fees of approximately million and continued to accrue interest on the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility at a rate of per year in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during that period 
in connection with our solicitation of votes for the plan  most of our lenders agreed to an additional waiver and forbearance of our credit facility until april  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the credit agreement as of december  the description of the credit facility below describes the facility as amended and restated on may   and further amended on september   december   january  and february  our credit facility provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility and for term loans that had a total principal amount of million as of may because the term loans include portions denominated in euros and canadian dollars  in addition to a us dollar denominated portion  the aggregate outstanding principal on our term loans is affected by our currency exchange rates as well as principal repayments 
the revolving credit facility matures on november   and the term loans mature on may  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries  subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loans bear interest at the sum of  as applicable  libor  the euribor or cdor rate plus  in each case  the applicable margin 
the applicable margin was set at through december  beginning january   the applicable margin depends upon our credit rating level it will be if our credit rating is ba or higher by moody s and bb or higher by s p  if our credit rating is b by moody s or b by s p  if our credit rating is b or higher but lower than b by moody s and b or higher but lower than b by s p  and if our credit rating is lower than b by moody s or lower than b by s p 
in order to qualify at each level the rating must be with a stable outlook 
our current credit rating is caa by moody s and cc by s p 
our current applicable margin is  except that during the waiver period  the outstanding balance under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate that is per year in excess of this rate 
on november   we entered into interest rate swap arrangements pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor  euribor or cdor rates 
the interest rate swap arrangements effectively fixed the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through december  these interest rate swaps initially qualified for hedge accounting under asc topic  derivatives and hedging topic 
as a result of the financial covenant 
table of contents non compliance for the period ended march   the debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  and accordingly  hedge accounting under topic was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a non cash charge to interest expense in the first quarter of and a non cash credit to interest expense of million in the second quarter of effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on variable interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  such mark to market changes on these interest rate swaps were principally credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive income loss through september  as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   we anticipated that we would not be in compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility for the period ending september  and thus  on september   we entered into the waiver agreement 
as of september  and december   we were not in compliance with those covenants under our senior credit facility 
as it was uncertain that we would be able to complete any alternative  long term solutions to our credit issues or to obtain a further waiver prior to expiration of the waiver agreement  we were no longer able to support that the variable rate interest payments hedged transactions under our senior credit facility were probable of occurring and therefore  effective september   we were required to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively for our interest rate swaps so that the mark to market changes in their fair value are charged or credited to interest expense 
for the month of september  this amounted to a million charge to interest expense in the million impact of the ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps and the discontinuation of hedge accounting were charged to interest expense during the year ended december  prior to september   the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualified as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives was recognized directly in earnings 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of august  related to the interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued will be subsequently reclassified into the statement of operations interest expense over the remaining original term of the derivative as the hedged forecasted transactions are also recorded to interest expense  in accordance with topic as of december   the balance in other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps was million 
however  if we are not able to restructure our debt obligations in a manner that is consistent with the hedged forecasted transactions or if our lenders accelerate the debt under the senior credit facility so that it is payable prior to the original expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps prior to their termination  as discussed as follows  the cumulative mark to market changes in the fair value of the underlying interest rate swaps that have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be charged to the statement of operations at that time 
although we were not declared in default of such obligations  on december   we terminated with the counterparties all of our outstanding interest rate swap liabilities of million and converted them into notes payable to such counterparties 
the swap termination counterparties have rights similar to the lenders under the credit facility 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings effective september   prior to their termination with the counterparties as discussed above  they effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through december  at 
as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility is no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 

table of contents the credit facility provides for remaining scheduled quarterly principal payments  in the aggregate amount of million for the years through  as outlined below  and a balloon payment of million due at maturity in may usd denominated debt in usd euro denominated debt in euro canadian dollar denominated debt in cad total scheduled quarterly payments converted into usd in usd millions in millions first quarter only the credit facility provides that for the purposes of computing debt  which is a part of the calculation of the leverage ratio  indebtedness which is payable in canadian dollars or euros shall be converted into us dollars using the average exchange rate for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended march  accordingly  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the euro or the canadian dollar and our adjusted ebitda declines as a result of this currency effect  there would not be a corresponding decrease in the amount of our debt for purposes of the leverage ratio covenant calculation 
the credit facility also requires us to make additional prepayments of the term loans under the following circumstances with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any sale  transfer or other disposition of any assets excluding inventory and certain discontinued manufacturing facilities  subject to an exemption for the reinvestment of up to million of such proceeds within a year of our receipt thereof in long term productive assets of the general type used in our business  with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any insurance recovery or condemnation events  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights and exempting the first million  with of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of any common stock  subject to customary exceptions and exempting the first with of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness by us excluding indebtedness permitted under the credit facility  but including any subordinated indebtedness  subject to customary exceptions  and with of our excess cash on an annual basis  that is  our adjusted ebitda minus consolidated interest expense  cash income tax expense  consolidated capital expenditures subject to certain exceptions  consolidated restructuring costs  cash payments of withholding taxes from proceeds of the repurchase  redemption or retention of common stock and the aggregate amount of scheduled and voluntary payments made during the past fiscal year 
prior to the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our credit facility  the percentage of our annual excess cash required to be prepaid was for  for and for each fiscal year thereafter 
we made mandatory principal prepayments from excess cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we also made a voluntary repayment of million 

table of contents our credit facility requires that we observe and perform numerous affirmative and negative covenants  including certain financial covenants 
the financial covenants per the amended credit facility are now as follows minimum interest coverage ratio four fiscal quarters ending ratio the ratio of four quarter adjusted ebitda to interest expense 
march  to march  june  to march  june  to december  march  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio four fiscal quarters ending ratio the ratio of four quarter adjusted ebitda to fixed charges interest expense  scheduled principal payments  and cash taxes 
june  to march  maximum leverage ratio four fiscal quarters ending ratio the ratio of outstanding debt to four quarter adjusted ebitda 
june  and september  december  march  and june  september  december  and march  june  to march  for the four fiscal quarters ended december  our interest coverage ratio was  our fixed charge coverage ratio was and our leverage ratio was accordingly  as discussed above  we were not in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  our credit facility defines consolidated capital expenditures for a particular fiscal year as all expenditures required under gaap to be included in purchase of property and equipment or similar items 
the credit facility limits the amount of our consolidated capital expenditures in any given fiscal year to an amount not exceeding million for fiscal year and million for each of fiscal years  and  exclusive of capital expenditures paid with net insurance and condemnation proceeds  provided that the maximum amount of consolidated capital expenditures permitted in each fiscal year shall be increased by of the amount below the maximum not spent in the prior fiscal year determined without reference to any carryover amount  and provided  further  that solely for fiscal year  the maximum amount that may be carried forward to fiscal year shall equal of the first million of any permitted consolidated expenditures not expended in fiscal year plus of any remaining expenditures not expended in fiscal year our credit facility also prohibits the payment of dividends on our common stock

as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility is no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 
includes obligations with respect to raw materials purchases  repair and maintenance services  utilities and capital expenditures 
amounts in other represent future cash outflows for which we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
off balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have formal accounting policies in place including those that address critical and complex accounting areas 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report identify the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
derivatives and hedging 
effective january   we adopted asc topic  transition and effective date related to fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
topic for disclosure related to derivatives 
table of contents and hedging 
topic amends and expands the disclosure requirements to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
topic requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
as required by topic  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or if we elect not to apply hedge accounting under topic there are two types of hedges into which we enter hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset or liability  or a firm commitment 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability 
changes in derivative fair values are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets and liabilities 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
on november   we entered into interest rate swap arrangements pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor  euribor or cdor rates 
the interest rate swap arrangements effectively fixed the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through december  these interest rate swaps initially qualified for hedge accounting under topic as a result of the financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   this debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  and accordingly  hedge accounting under topic was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a non cash charge to interest expense in the first quarter of and a non cash credit to interest expense of million in the second quarter of effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on variable interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  such mark to market changes on these interest rate swaps were principally credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive income loss through september  effective september   we were required to discontinue hedge accounting for these interest rate swaps because it was uncertain that we would be able to complete any alternative  long term solutions to our credit issues or to obtain a further waiver prior to expiration of the waiver agreement that was entered into on september  accordingly  we were no longer able to support that the variable rate interest payments hedged transactions under our senior credit facility were probable of occurring and therefore  effective september   we were required to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively for our interest rate swaps so that the mark to market changes in their fair value are charged or credited to interest expense 
for  this amounted to a million charge to interest expense 

table of contents prior to september   the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualified as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives was recognized directly in earnings 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of august  related to the interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued will be subsequently reclassified into the statement of operations interest expense over the remaining original term of the derivative as the hedged forecasted transactions are also recorded to interest expense  in accordance with topic as of december   the balance in other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps was million 
however  if we are not able to restructure our debt obligations in a manner that is consistent with the hedged forecasted transactions or if our lenders accelerate the debt under the senior credit facility so that it is payable prior to the original expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps prior to their termination  as discussed as follows  the cumulative mark to market changes in the fair value of the underlying interest rate swaps that have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be charged to the statement of operations at that time 
although we were not declared in default of such obligations  on december   we terminated with the counterparties all of our outstanding interest rate swaps in the amount of million and converted them into notes payable to such counterparties 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings effective september   they effectively fixed  prior to their termination with the counterparties as discussed above  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through december  at 
the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility is no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 
effective january   we adopted topic for measuring our derivative assets and liabilities 
we have classified our interest rate swaps in level of the topic fair value hierarchy  as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on market observable data or information derived from or corroborated by market observable data  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  and correlations of such inputs 
for our derivatives  all of which trade in liquid markets  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
to comply with the provisions of topic  we incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives 
the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty s credit spread to the applicable exposure 
for derivatives with two way exposure  such as interest rate swaps  the counterparty s credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty  and our own credit spread is applied to the counterparty s exposure to us  and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations 
the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using market observable inputs  such as yield curves and volatilities 
the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from its publicly traded debt 
for counterparties with publicly available credit information  the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
additionally  we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes 

table of contents although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties 
however  as of december   the credit valuation adjustments have no impact on the overall valuation of our derivative positions as we terminated all of our outstanding interest rate swaps with the counterparties on december  various factors which impact changes in the credit are not significant to the overall valuation adjustments over time  including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts  as well as changes in market rates and volatilities  which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments 
when appropriate  valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bid offer spreads  which factors were deemed immaterial by us as of december  as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
we do not have any fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level as of december  effective january   we partially adopted provisions of topic asc topic  transition related to fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
permitted us to defer the recognition and measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  at january   we did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
goodwill 
we account for acquired goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  business combinations topic 
purchase accounting required by topic involves judgment with respect to the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities in order to determine the amount of goodwill 
we have recorded our acquisitions in accordance with topic impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with topic  which requires considerable judgment in the valuation of acquired goodwill and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill impairment 
topic requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but  instead  must be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or business conditions warrant 
we perform an annual test for goodwill impairment as of december st at the business segment level 
we have two business segments clothing and roll covers 
when our business was acquired in  more than of the goodwill was assigned to the roll covers segment based on relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test  we allocate all shared assets and liabilities to the business segments based upon the percentage of each segment s revenue to total revenue 
shared expenses are allocated to each segment to the extent necessary to allow them to operate as independent businesses 
fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of both a market multiple approach and an income approach 
the market multiple approach utilizes our proprietary information to determine measures that are used to value our business segments 
the income approach is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each business segment 
determining the fair value of a business segment or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates 
table of contents and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under topic are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
based on these assessments performed as of december   we determined that our goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired due to expectations of lower profitability and to the increased carrying value of the net assets of the roll covers segment due primarily to currency translation effects thereon 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million and a related tax benefit of million related to our roll covers segment 
step of the process indicated that the fair value of the net assets of the roll covers segment was million less than their carrying value as of december  based on the step result  we proceeded with step based on the increase in fair value of tangible and intangible assets over book value of million as determined in step  an aggregate impairment of million was recorded 
there was no goodwill impairment recorded for the clothing segment during the year ended december   nor for either segment prior to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing segment as of december  was approximately million 
based on these assessments performed as of december   we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing and roll covers segment as of december   the annual test date  was approximately million and million  respectively 
at that time  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of these business segments  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million and million for the clothing segment and roll covers segment  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we evaluated events and circumstances that may have indicated an impairment of goodwill and performed an interim test for goodwill impairment 
this interim test indicated that no impairment existed 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing and roll covers segment as of september   was approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of these business segments  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million for the clothing segment and resulted in a fair value that approximately equals the carrying value for the roll covers segment 
as of december   we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million related to our roll covers segment based on assessments performed as of that date 
applying the guidance of topic  we determined that as of december   goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired primarily due to the adverse effect of the company s credit issues and the effects of the current global economic environment 
step of the process indicated that the fair value of the net assets of the roll covers segment was million less than their carrying value as of december  based on the step result  we proceeded with step based on the increase in fair value of tangible and intangible assets over book value of million as determined in step  an aggregate impairment of million was recorded in the roll covers segment 
to date  there have been no indicators of impairment or recorded goodwill impairment for the company s clothing segment 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing segment as of december  was approximately million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of this business segment  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million for the clothing segment 
contingencies 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax  environmental and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with asc topic  contingencies 
while we believe that the current level of 
table of contents reserves is adequate  the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters 
during the third quarter of  while evaluating one of our foreign facilities  we discovered the possibility of contamination at the facility 
subsequently we had a preliminary evaluation performed  which confirmed the existence of contamination and estimated preliminary costs to clean up the facility 
based upon this evaluation  we recorded million in as our best estimate of the remediation costs we expected to incur 
a phase ii assessment of the ground water contamination performed for us during the second quarter of indicated the costs to remediate the contamination would be significantly less than originally estimated and accordingly  we reduced the accrual by million during the second quarter of based on this assessment 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes topic 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recognized a net deferred tax liability of million at december  and million at december  the deferred taxes relate principally to pension and post retirement benefits  intangible assets and differences between the book and tax bases of property and equipment 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
relevant evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
in light of our accumulated loss position in certain tax jurisdictions  and the uncertainty of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in australia  canada  sweden  the united kingdom and the united states 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested except for argentina  brazil and mexico 
to the extent earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested  no provision for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to both income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various jurisdictions 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability or withholding taxes is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards would be available to reduce some portion of the liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and rely on estimates and assumptions 
these audits may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
there are currently no us federal or state audits or examinations underway 
in may  we concluded an audit relating to our german subsidiaries for tax years through no further adjustments not previously recognized were required in the year ended december  as a result of this settlement 
the canadian federal tax authorities contacted us in october of and have initiated an audit of our canadian companies 
the audit is still in the initial information gathering stages and no issues or assessments have been raised 
the italian tax authorities are also in the process of conducting an examination for certain of our italian entities 
the audit is still in the initial information gathering stages and we are currently working to address issues that have been raised 
we believe that there are no other jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties 

table of contents topic relates to uncertain tax positions and prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
pension and postretirement plans 
we have various defined benefit plans and we also had an unfunded plan to provide postretirement health insurance benefits to substantially all retired us employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
during the third quarter of  we froze benefit pension accruals under our pension plan for us salaried and non union hourly employees the pension plan effective december  so that future service beyond december  is no longer credited under the pension plan  and also curtailed sponsoring or funding  as of december   our us retiree health insurance benefit program 
accordingly we had lower pension expense in as compared with  assuming all other variables were held constant  and minimal postretirement expense in we use assumptions  such as expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate  to determine our pension expense 
we cannot determine whether or how much future assumptions may change 
however  as of december   a increase or decrease in the following assumptions would increase decrease pension expense  on a pre tax basis as follows in millions effect of increase in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset increase decrease to pension expense effect of decrease in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset increase decrease to pension expense non gaap liquidity measures we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplementary non gaap liquidity measures to assist us in evaluating our liquidity and financial performance  specifically our ability to service indebtedness and to fund ongoing capital expenditures 
our credit facility includes covenants based on adjusted ebitda 
if our adjusted ebitda declines below certain levels  we will violate the covenants resulting in a default condition under the credit facility or be required to prepay the credit facility 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income loss from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  income tax provision benefit and depreciation including non cash impairment charges and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined in our credit facility and is ebitda plus i restructuring or related impairment costs not to exceed million in the aggregate for and in each year thereafter  ii reserves for inventory in connection with plant closings  iii stock based and other non cash compensation charges  charges from forgiveness of loans made to employees in connection with the purchase of equity and any tax gross up payments made in respect of such loan forgiveness in connection with or prior to the completion of our initial public offering  iv certain transaction

adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit facility and calculated below  may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging 
we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale and intercompany debt transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to these exposures  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
the value of these contracts is recognized at fair value based on market exchange forward rates and amounted to a net liability position of less than million at december  these contracts mature at various dates through august as of december   we had open foreign currency exchange contracts maturing through august with total net notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   we prepared an analysis to determine the sensitivity of our forward foreign exchange contracts to changes in exchange rates 
a hypothetical adverse exchange rate movement of against our forward foreign exchange contracts would have resulted in a potential net loss in fair value of these contracts that would be immaterial 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
for additional information about the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange 
interest rate hedging 
our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
on november   we entered into interest rate swap arrangements pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor  euribor or cdor rates 
these interest rate swaps initially qualified for hedge accounting under topic as a result of the financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   this debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  and accordingly  hedge accounting under topic was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a non cash charge to interest expense in the first quarter of and a non cash credit to interest expense of million in the second quarter of effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on variable interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  such mark to market changes on these interest rate swaps were principally credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive income loss through september  effective september   we were required to discontinue hedge accounting for these interest rate swaps because it was uncertain that we would be able to complete any alternative  long term solutions to our credit issues or to obtain a further waiver prior to expiration of the waiver agreement that was entered into on september  accordingly  we were no longer able to support that the variable rate interest payments hedged transactions under our senior credit facility were probable of occurring and therefore  effective september   we were required to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively for our interest rate swaps so that the mark to market changes in their fair value are charged or credited to interest expense 
for  this amounted to a million charge to interest expense 

table of contents prior to september   the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualified as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives was recognized directly in earnings 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of august  related to the interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued will be subsequently reclassified into the statement of operations interest expense over the remaining original term of the derivative as the hedged forecasted transactions are also recorded to interest expense  in accordance with topic as of december   the balance in other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps was million 
however  if we are not able to restructure our debt obligations in a manner that is consistent with the hedged forecasted transactions or if our lenders accelerate the debt under the senior credit facility so that it is payable prior to the original expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps prior to their termination  as discussed as follows  the cumulative mark to market changes in the fair value of the underlying interest rate swaps that have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be charged to the statement of operations at that time 
although we were not declared in default of such obligations  on december   we terminated with the counterparties all of our outstanding interest rate swap liabilities of million and converted them into notes payable to such counterparties 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings effective september   prior to their termination with the counterparties as discussed above  they effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through december  at and the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
as a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps  the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility is no longer effectively fixed through december   the original term of the swaps 
as a result of the amendment of our senior credit facility agreement on may   the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans under our senior credit facility increased from to  except that during the waiver period  the outstanding balance under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate that is per year in excess of the non default rate otherwise payable during that period under the credit facility 
the non default rate is libor  the euribor or cdor rate plus the applicable margin of 
we estimate that a increase in the libor rate would increase our interest expense on the term debt by approximately million on an annual basis through december   the period covered by the interest rate swap agreements that we terminated with the counterparties on december  due to reduced credit limits at some of our banks  we have entered into fewer foreign currency hedging arrangements and may not be able to enter into as many hedging arrangements in the future 
as discussed above  we also were required to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively effective september  for our interest rate swaps so that the mark to market changes in their fair value are charged or credited to interest expense 
consequently  our financial statements are more exposed to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations  respectively  both favorable and unfavorable  which could have a material impact on our results of operations
