item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  chip  medicaid expansion programs and medicare advantage 
we operate in one business segment with a single line of business 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
we believe that we are better qualified and positioned than many of our competitors to meet the unique needs of our members and the government agencies with whom we contract because of our focus solely on recipients of publicly sponsored healthcare  our medical management programs and community based education and outreach programs 
we design our programs to address the particular needs of our members  for whom we facilitate access to healthcare benefits pursuant to agreements with applicable state and federal government agencies 
we combine medical  social and behavioral health services to help our members obtain quality healthcare in an efficient manner 
our success in establishing and maintaining strong relationships with government agencies  providers and members has enabled us to obtain new contracts and to establish and maintain a leading market position in many of the markets we serve 
we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that improves health outcomes for our members while helping our government customers manage the fiscal viability of their healthcare programs 
summary highlights for the year ended december  total revenues increased to billion  or  over the year ended december   risk membership increased to  or  compared to that as of december   hbr of compared to for the year ended december  began providing medicaid managed care services to tanf and chip populations in nevada effective february   closed the transaction to sell the contract rights of the company s south carolina health plan on march   completed the statewide rollout to individuals of new mexico s coordination of long term services colts program in april this program constitutes one of the nation s first comprehensive programs to coordinate long term care for individuals 
we are one of two organizations that provide coverage to new mexico s approximately  colts members  repaid the outstanding debt and terminated our credit and guaranty agreement the credit agreement  decreasing our debt to total capital ratio to  and recorded a one time tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  pursuant to a pre filing agreement with the internal revenue service irs related to the tax treatment of the previously recorded qui tam litigation settlement relating to certain marketing practices of our former illinois subsidiary 
our financial results for have been significantly impacted by several factors  including increased membership and elevated medical costs 
membership has increased over the prior comparable periods as a result of our entry into new markets and growth in existing markets 
much of this increased membership has come from growth in the medicaid eligible populations 
our medical costs have been elevated over the prior comparable period in excess of our growth in premium revenues thereby increasing our health benefits ratio over such periods 
the elevated costs are primarily due to increases in outpatient services  for both new and existing members 
increased costs for emergency room services  ambulatory surgery and physician services as well as an early onset of a severe flu season related to the hn virus have been the most significant drivers of increased outpatient services 
the cost for healthcare benefits has also increased due in part to a larger proportion of new members who historically utilize more services during the first two quarters of membership 
the rate of increase in health benefits expense as it compares to premium revenue has been higher than our experience in recent years 
as such  it is difficult to predict at this time whether outpatient costs will continue to increase at the current rate or abate in we are continually evaluating our operations and contracting arrangements with our providers in order to more effectively manage medical costs and we are working with the government agencies with which we contract to pursue appropriate premium rate increases when possible 
our ability to obtain adequate rate increases to match the increases in our medical costs is likely to be challenging in the near term because the government agencies with whom we contract continue to face potential budgetary shortfalls and there can be no assurance that we will obtain adequate premium rate increases 
though we cannot predict the outcomes of potential legislation  if any  we anticipate the subject of healthcare reform will continue to be debated by the united states congress and that any changes to existing medicaid and medicare programs could have significant impacts on our business 
investment income on our fixed income securities portfolio has been significantly impacted by decreased investment yields over the past year 
investment income is a significant component of our operating results and fluctuations in investment yields such as that we have experienced can have and have had a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate a return of investment yields to normalized levels in the near term 
our sg a ratio decreased due to administrative efficiencies gained through the management of costs  increased premium revenue and decreased levels of variable compensation accruals due to our financial performance 
business strategy we have a disciplined approach to evaluating the operating performance of our existing markets to determine whether to exit or continue operating in each market 
as a result  in the past we have and may in the future decide to exit certain markets if they do not meet our long term business goals 
we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities to determine if they align with our business strategy 
we continue to believe acquisitions can be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
opportunities for future membership growth texas in november  the texas health and human services commission hhsc issued a request for proposal to provide managed care services for abd clients in the dallas and tarrant service areas under the texas medicaid star plus program 
hhsc intends to select no less than four managed care organizations two per service area to serve approximately  eligibles 
we submitted a bid to the hhsc on february  we anticipate a contract start date in may and an operational start date in early we can make no assurance that we will be awarded this contract or that such business will be favorable to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
tennessee the state of tennessee received approval from the cms to expand its medicaid managed care program to long term care recipients 
the expansion program is offered through amendments to existing medicaid managed care contracts and is effective march  we can make no assurance that our entry into this business will be favorable to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
new jersey on october   amerigroup corporation and amerigroup new jersey  inc settled litigation with centene and its wholly owned subsidiary  uhp  regarding amerigroup new jersey  inc s termination of an agreement to purchase certain assets of uhp 
pursuant to the terms of the confidential settlement  the parties dismissed the litigation with prejudice and an amended and modified asset purchase agreement was reinstated 
the parties will move forward with the transaction contemplated by the amended and modified asset purchase agreement  as modified in connection with the settlement  and expect the transaction  which is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions  to close in the early part of costs associated with the transaction are not expected to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we can make no assurance that entry into such business will be favorable to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
other market updates florida effective november  and december   our florida subsidiary  amerigroup florida  inc  terminated its agreement and ceased participation in lee county and broward county  respectively  under the company s contract with ahca 
the decision to exit these counties was made due to the inability to obtain adequate premium rates 
the exit from these counties is not expected to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
ohio on october   our ohio subsidiary  amerigroup ohio  inc  notified the state of ohio of its intent to exit the abd program in the southwest region due to the inability to obtain adequate premium rates for this product 
the termination was effective as of february  amerigroup ohio  inc will continue to provide services to members in the southwest and west central regions for the tanf medicaid population 
the exit from this program is not expected to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in future periods 
south carolina on march   our south carolina subsidiary  amerigroup community care of south carolina  inc  sold its rights to serve medicaid members pursuant to the contract with the state of south carolina for million  or per diluted share  and recorded a gain  which is included in investment income and other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  for the year ended december  as a result of this transaction  our south carolina subsidiary does not currently serve any members 
certain claims run out and transition obligations exist that will continue into additional costs recorded and to be recorded to discontinue operations in south carolina are not expected to be material 
nevada on february   our nevada subsidiary  amerigroup nevada  inc  began serving tanf and chip members under a contract to provide medicaid managed care services through june  amerigroup nevada  inc is one of two organizations that provide managed care services across the urban service areas of washoe and clark counties 
as of december   amerigroup nevada  inc served approximately  members in nevada 
new mexico on august   our new mexico subsidiary  amerigroup new mexico  inc  began serving individuals in new mexico s colts program in six counties in the metro central region 
in november  the second phase expanded coverage to include the southwest region 
in january  the third phase expanded coverage to include the northwest region and in april the final phase of the statewide rollout was completed to include the southeast and northeast regions 
amerigroup new mexico  inc is one of two organizations that provide coverage to new mexico s approximately  colts members 
as of december   amerigroup new mexico  inc served approximately  members in new mexico 
contingencies florida medicaid contract dispute under the terms of the contract between amerigroup florida  inc and ahca  amerigroup florida  inc is required to have a process to identify members who are pregnant or newborn members so that the newborn can be enrolled as a member of the health plan as soon as possible after birth 
this process is referred to as the unborn activation process 
beginning in july  amerigroup florida  inc received a series of letters from the florida office of the inspector general ig and ahca stating that amerigroup florida  inc had failed to comply with the unborn activation process and  as a result  ahca had paid approximately million in medicaid fee for service claims that should have been paid by amerigroup florida  inc the letters requested that amerigroup florida  inc provide documentation to evidence it s compliance with the terms of the contract with ahca with respect to the unborn activation process 
it is our belief that ahca and the ig sent similar letters to the other florida medicaid managed care organizations during this time period 
in october  we submitted our response to the letters 
in july  we received another series of letters from the ig and ahca stating that  based on a review of our response  they had determined that amerigroup florida  inc did not comply with the unborn activation process and assessed a penalty against amerigroup florida  inc in the amount of  per newborn for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
the letters further reserved ahca s right to pursue collection of the amount paid for the fee for service claims 
amerigroup florida  inc appealed these findings and submitted documentation to evidence its compliance with  and performance under  the unborn activation process requirements of the contract 
on january  amerigroup florida  inc appealed ahca s contract interpretation that anything less than compliance with the unborn activation process could result in sanctions 
this appeal is pending 
we believe that amerigroup florida  inc has substantial defenses to the claims asserted by ahca and will defend against the claims vigorously 
however  there can be no assurances that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
georgia letter of credit effective july   we have caused to be issued a collateralized irrevocable standby letter of credit in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million to meet certain obligations under our medicaid contract in the state of georgia through our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc the letter of credit is collateralized through cash held by amgp georgia managed care company  inc legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based upon our evaluation of the information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect  either individually or in the aggregate  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we have been involved in specific litigation in the current year  the details of which are disclosed in part i  item entitled legal proceedings 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums and aso fees we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for healthcare services for our tanf  chip  abd and familycare members 
we receive premiums from cms for our medicare advantage members 
we recognize premium and aso fee revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed amount per member per month pmpm is paid to us to arrange for healthcare services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government agencies with whom we contract 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative revenue adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
adjustments to eligibility data received from these government agencies result from retroactive application of enrollment or disenrollment of members or classification changes of members between rate categories that were not known by us in previous months due to timing of the receipt of data or errors in processing by the government agencies 
these changes  while common  are not generally large 
retroactive adjustments to revenue for corrections in eligibility data are recorded in the period in which the information becomes known 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate 
in all of the states in which we operate  with the exceptions of florida  new mexico  tennessee and virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments to offset the health benefits expense associated with the birth of a baby 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are collectible 
upon delivery of a baby  each state is notified in accordance with contract terms 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for those services 
changes in authorization and claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues can occur as a result of changes in eligibility noted above or corrections of errors in the underlying data 
adjustments to revenue for corrections to authorization and claims data are recorded in the period in which the corrections become known 
historically  the impact of adjustments from retroactivity  changes in authorizations and changes in claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues has represented less than of annual revenue 
this results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
additionally  delays in annual premium rate changes require that we defer the recognition of any increases to the period in which the premium rates become final 
the time lag between the effective date of the premium rate increase and the final contract can and has been delayed one quarter or more 
the value of the impact can be significant in the period in which it is recognized dependent on the magnitude of the premium rate change  the membership to which it applies and the length of the delay between the effective date and the final contract date 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable the most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable 
at december   this liability was million and represented of our total consolidated liabilities 
included in this liability and the corresponding health benefits expense for ibnr claims are the estimated costs of processing such claims 
health benefits expense has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical claims payable since inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
in developing our medical claims payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for mature incurred months generally the months prior to the most recent three months  we calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the date of estimation 
we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
we do not believe that completion factors are fully credible for estimating claims incurred for the most recent two to three months which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical claims payable 
accordingly  we estimate health benefits expense incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average pmpm medical costs incurred in a more complete time period 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available 
the average pmpm is also adjusted for known changes in hospital authorization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  age and gender mix of members  and seasonality 
the incurred estimates resulting from the analysis of completion factors  medical cost trend factors and other known changes are weighted together using actuarial judgment 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  new flu strains  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our members in our assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated  as opposed to a fee for service  basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical cost trend 
other external factors that may impact medical cost trends include factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics  such as the hn pandemic  or increases in membership that contribute to an increase in outpatient costs 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately establish estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends are potentially more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of health benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical claims payable estimates for mature incurred months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in decrease increase in factor medical claims payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expense and medical claims payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
medical cost pmpm trend factors are generally the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical claims payable for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expense and medical claims payable caused by changes in medical costs pmpm trend data used in developing medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating our medical claims payable 
changes in estimates of medical claims payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submission and our payment processes often results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
deviations  whether positive or negative  between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known 
we continually monitor and adjust the medical claims payable and health benefits expense based on subsequent paid claims activity 
if it is determined that our assumptions regarding medical cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results  our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be impacted in future periods 
adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional health benefits expense or a reduction of health benefits expense in the period an adjustment is made 
further  due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs  adjustments to medical claims payable occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter 
prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuaries judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims payable for the three years ended december in thousands medical claims payable as of january health benefits expense incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year health benefits expense incurred health benefits expense incurred related to prior years as a percent of prior year medical claims payable as of december health benefits expense incurred related to prior years as a percent of the prior year s health benefits expense related to current year health benefits expense incurred during the year  was reduced by approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  for amounts related to prior years 
as noted above  the actuarial standards of practice generally require that the liabilities established for ibnr be sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
we did not experience moderately adverse conditions in any of these periods 
therefore included in the amounts related to prior years are approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to amounts included in the medical claims payable as of january of each respective year in order to establish the liability at a level adequate for moderately adverse conditions 
the remaining reduction in health benefits expense incurred during the year  related to prior years  of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily resulted from obtaining more complete claims information for claims incurred for dates of service in the prior years 
we refer to these amounts as net reserve development 
we experienced lower medical trend than originally estimated in part due to claims processing initiatives that yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits in  and related to prior year dates of services for all periods 
these recoveries also caused our actuarial estimates to include faster completion factors than were originally established 
the faster completion factors contributed to the net favorable reserve development in each respective period 
establishing the liabilities for ibnr associated with health benefits expense incurred during a year related to that current year  at a level sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  will cause incurred health benefits expense for that current year to be higher than if ibnr was established without sufficiency for moderately adverse conditions 
in the above table  the health benefits expense incurred during the year related to the current year include an assumption to cover moderately adverse conditions 
also included in medical claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
premium deficiency reserves in addition to incurred but not paid claims  the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies  if appropriate 
we review each state medicaid and federal medicare contract under which we operate on a quarterly basis for any apparent premium deficiency 
in doing so  we evaluate current medical cost trends  expected premium rate changes and termination clauses to determine our exposure to future losses  if any 
premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and investment income on existing medical insurance contracts 
for purposes of premium deficiencies  contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring  servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts 
we did not have any premium deficiency reserves at december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with current accounting guidance as prescribed under us generally accepted accounting principles 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability based on enacted tax rates  estimates of book to tax differences in income  and projections of income that will be earned in each taxing jurisdiction 
deferred tax assets and liabilities representing the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting net income and taxable income are measured at the tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded 
after tax returns for the applicable year are filed  the estimated tax liability is adjusted to the actual liability per the filed state and federal tax returns 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates of tax liability and our actual tax liability 
similar to other companies  we sometimes face challenges from the tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
positions taken on our tax returns are evaluated and benefits are recognized only if it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained on audit 
based on our evaluation of tax positions  we believe that we have appropriately accounted for potential tax exposures 
in addition  we are periodically audited by state and federal taxing authorities and these audits can result in proposed assessments 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and  as such  will vigorously defend these positions on audit 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
although the ultimate resolution of these audits may require additional tax payments  we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings 
the qui tam litigation settlement payment in had a significant impact on tax expense and the effective tax rates for and due to the fact that a portion of the settlement payment is not deductible for income tax purposes 
at december   the estimated tax benefit associated with the qui tam litigation settlement payment was approximately million 
in june  we recorded an additional million tax benefit regarding the tax treatment of the qui tam litigation settlement under an agreement in principle with the irs which was formalized through a pre filing agreement with the irs in september the pre filing agreement program permits taxpayers to resolve tax issues in advance of filing their corporate income tax returns 
we do not anticipate that there will be any further material changes to the tax benefit associated with this litigation settlement in future periods 
for further information  please reference note to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in item of this form k 
investments as of december   we had investments with a carrying value of billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost 
for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other causes  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at acquisition requires assumptions regarding estimated discounted cash flows and market analyses 
these assumptions contain uncertainties because they require management to use judgment in selecting the assumptions and applying the market analyses to the individual acquisitions 
additionally  impairment evaluations require management to use judgment to determine if impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is apparent 
we have applied a consistent methodology in both the original valuation and subsequent impairment evaluations for all goodwill and intangible assets 
we do not anticipate any changes to that methodology  nor has any impairment loss resulted from our analyses other than that recognized in connection with discontinued operations in west tennessee and the district of columbia in the prior year 
based on our analysis  we have concluded that a margin of in fair value in excess of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles exists as of december  if the assumptions used to evaluate the value of goodwill and intangible assets change in the future  an impairment loss may be recorded and it could be material to our results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss occurs 
recent accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance related to convertible debt instruments which requires the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner reflective of the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the amount allocated to the equity component represents a discount to the debt  which is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the adoption of this new guidance on january   with retrospective application to prior periods  changed the accounting treatment for our convertible senior notes  which were issued effective march  see note q to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in item of this form k 
to adopt the provisions of this new guidance  the fair value of the convertible senior notes was estimated  as of the date of issuance  as if they were issued without the conversion options 
the difference between the fair value and the principal amounts of the convertible senior notes was million 
this amount was retrospectively applied to the financial statements from the issuance date of the convertible senior notes in  and was retrospectively recorded as a debt discount and as a component of equity 
the discount is being amortized over the expected five year life of the convertible senior notes resulting in a non cash increase to interest expense in historical and future periods 
the retrospective adoption of the provisions of this new guidance resulted in an increase to interest expense for the years ended december  and  of million and million  respectively  representing the non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount  which is in addition to million and million  respectively  representing cash interest expense related to the contractual coupon rate incurred in the periods

the increase was primarily due to two factors entry into new markets including the new mexico market under the colts program commencing with six counties in august and completing a full statewide rollout in april and entry into the nevada market in february  and significant increases in full risk membership driven by a surge in medicaid eligibility in our existing products and markets partially due to the increase in unemployment as a result of current macroeconomic conditions 
we expect membership increases to continue into premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of operations in tennessee which commenced in april as well as premium rate and yield increases in that market and entry into the new mexico market under the colts program beginning in august the remaining growth in is a result of premium rate increases and yield increases resulting from changes in membership mix across many of our markets 
lastly  in both the tennessee and georgia markets benefited from retroactive premium rate adjustments related to operations in of approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of members we served in each state as of december   and because we receive two premiums for members that are in both the medicare advantage and medicaid products  these members have been counted twice in the states where we operate medicare advantage plans 
december  market texas georgia florida tennessee maryland new jersey new york nevada ohio virginia new mexico south carolina district of columbia total membership includes approximately  members each in and under aso contracts 
there were no aso contracts in effect as of december  membership includes approximately  members under an aso contract in this contract terminated october  the contract with south carolina terminated march  concurrent with the sale of our rights under the contract 
the contract with the district of columbia terminated june  as of december   our total membership increased by  members  or  to  members from  as of december  our risk membership increased to  or  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase is primarily a result of membership growth in the majority of our products and markets driven by a surge in medicaid eligibility  which we believe was driven by high unemployment and general adverse economic conditions 
additionally  our entry into the nevada market in february and the commencement of the colts program in new mexico in august contributed to our membership growth 
at december   we served members who received healthcare benefits through contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for the year ended december   the texas contract represented approximately of premium revenues and a significantly higher percentage of our net income 
the maryland  tennessee  georgia and florida contracts individually accounted for over of premium revenues 
our state contracts have terms that are generally one to two years in length  some of which contain optional renewal periods at the discretion of the individual states 
some contracts also contain a termination clause with notification periods ranging from to days 
at the termination of these contracts  re negotiation of terms or the requirement to enter into a re bidding or re procurement process is required to execute a new contract 
if these contracts were not renewed on favorable terms to us  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our investment portfolio generated approximately million in pre tax income for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is primarily a result of decreased rates of return on fixed income securities due to current market interest rates 
we anticipate that our effective yield will remain at or below the current rate as of december  for the foreseeable future  which will result in similar or reduced returns on our investment portfolio in future periods 
the performance of our investment portfolio is interest rate driven and  consequently  changes in interest rates affect our returns on  and the fair value of  our portfolio which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity in future periods 
other revenue for the year ended december   decreased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  included in other revenue for the year ended december  is the approximate million gain on the sale of the south carolina contract rights 
included in other revenue for the year ended december  is the aso revenue from the west tennessee contract which concluded on october  revenues from this contract totaled approximately million for the year ended december  health benefits expense expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december   increased million  or  to billion compared to billion for the year ended december  hbr increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in health benefits expense as it compares to premium revenue for the year ended december  resulted primarily from increased outpatient costs experienced across the majority of our markets and membership base 
we believe these increased outpatient costs are related to increased utilization and intensity of services 
the primary drivers of the increase in outpatient costs were emergency room services  ambulatory surgery and physician services 
while health benefits expense increased commensurate with the significant increase in our membership  it was further increased by the larger proportion of new members 
historical experience indicates that new members generally utilize more services during the first two quarters of enrollment 
additionally  our results reflect a significant increase in flu related costs 
we believe this increase is directly related to the onset of a severe off season flu outbreak associated with the hn virus  which has been noted to be particularly virulent among children  pregnant women  and other high risk populations  all of whom together represent a significant portion of our membership 
additionally  our entry into the new mexico market  with a higher hbr due to the benefit structure of the colts program  contributed to the increase in hbr overall 
in total  the increases in health benefits expense exceeded growth in premium revenues  thereby negatively impacting hbr for the year ended december  expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in our results compared to reflect a decrease in the hbr primarily as a result of retroactive premium rate adjustments in tennessee and georgia  totaling approximately million  in addition to premium rate increases and yield increases in our other markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our sg a as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in the sg a ratio is primarily a result of reductions in salary and benefits expenses 
in  variable compensation was lower due to decreases in our variable compensation accruals related to our operating results 
the decrease in the sg a ratio was also the result of leverage gained through an increase in premium revenue through new market expansion and existing market growth and the termination of our aso contract in west tennessee october  sg a increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to wage rate increases  increases in employee healthcare benefit expenses  and increased earnings based compensation as a result of favorable operating performance as well as the write off of goodwill related to our market exits in west tennessee and the district of columbia 
premium tax expense premium taxes were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is a result of the commencement of the colts program in new mexico in august  entry into nevada in february  adoption of premium tax in the state of new york effective january  a premium tax rate increase in tennessee effective july and growth in premium revenues across all markets where premium tax is levied 
these increases were partially offset by the termination of premium tax in the state of georgia in october the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is a result of our entry into new mexico in august and growth in premium revenues in the markets where premium tax is levied 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to is primarily a result of decreased amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the term loan repaid in july the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to was a result of an increase in fixed assets and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to significant principal payments on the term loan in litigation settlement on august   we settled a qui tam litigation relating to certain marketing practices of our former illinois health plan for a cash payment of million without any admission of wrong doing by us or our subsidiaries or affiliates 
we also paid approximately million to the relator for legal fees 
both payments were made during the three months ended september  as a result  we recorded a one time expense in the amount of million  or million net of the related tax effects  in the year ended december  and reported a net loss 
in june  we recorded a million tax benefit regarding the tax treatment of the settlement under an agreement in principle with the irs which was formalized through a pre filing agreement with the irs in september the pre filing agreement program permits taxpayers to resolve tax issues in advance of filing their corporate income tax returns 
we do not anticipate that there will be any further material changes to the tax benefit associated with this settlement in future periods 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is a result of scheduled and voluntary payments resulting in payment in full of all outstanding balances under our credit agreement as of july  as well as fluctuating interest rates for previous borrowings under the credit agreement 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is a result of decreased interest rates in compared to and principal payments on outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement reducing the balance on which interest was paid 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for and was million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was significantly decreased due to a pre filing agreement reached with the irs in regarding the tax treatment of the qui tam litigation settlement payment resulting in an additional tax benefit of million over what was recorded in additionally  the effective tax rate excluding this benefit decreased due to the decrease in the blended state income tax rate compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was significantly impacted by the non deductible portion of the qui tam litigation settlement payment 
income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of 
net income loss net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in net income for was million or per diluted share 
net income increased from to and decreased from to primarily as a result of the one time expense recorded in in connection with the settlement of the qui tam litigation equal to million before the related tax benefit 
the trend in earnings of the underlying business reflects a higher hbr due to increased outpatient costs  flu related costs as well as increased utilization and intensity of services for the year ended december  compared to december  for the year ended december  compared to december   the impact of the litigation settlement was mitigated in part by a lower hbr due to retroactive premium adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments which are unregulated totaled million at december  financing activities credit agreement we previously maintained a credit agreement that provided both a secured term loan and a senior secured revolving credit facility 
on july   we paid the remaining balance of the secured term loan 
effective august   we terminated the credit agreement and related pledge and security agreement 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of the effective date of termination 
convertible senior notes as of december   we had million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due may  in may  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering the resale of the convertible senior notes and common stock issuable upon conversion 
the convertible senior notes are governed by an indenture dated as of march  the indenture 
the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to all of our subordinated debt 
the convertible senior notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and to any existing and future secured indebtedness 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  beginning on may  the convertible senior notes mature on may   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with the indenture 
upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the convertible senior notes converted 
with respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount  we have the option to settle the excess with cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof based on a daily conversion value  as defined in the indenture 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes will be shares of common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of convertible senior notes  which represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on march  and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
in addition  if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date  we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of convertible senior notes that elects to convert their convertible senior notes in connection with such fundamental change 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased convertible note hedges covering  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash equal to the amounts of common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the convertible senior notes upon conversion 
these convertible note hedges will terminate at the earlier of the maturity date of the convertible senior notes or the first day on which none of the convertible senior notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the convertible note hedges  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedges  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants discussed below when such warrants are exercised  we will be required to issue common stock 
both the convertible note hedges and warrants provide for net share settlement at the time of any exercise for the amount that the market value of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price 
also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we sold warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the settlement date exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are separate transactions which will not affect holders rights under the convertible senior notes 
universal automatic shelf registration on december   we filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement with the sec which enables us to sell  in one or more public offerings  common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the applicable offering 
the shelf registration provides us with the flexibility to publicly offer and sell securities at times we believe market conditions make such an offering attractive 
because we are a well known seasoned issuer  the shelf registration statement was effective upon filing 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
stock repurchase program under the authorization of our board of directors  we maintain an on going share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock from and after august  pursuant to this on going share repurchase program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average per share cost of approximately and an aggregate cost of million and placed them into treasury during the year ended december  as of december   we had authorization to purchase up to an additional million of common stock under the repurchase program 
cash and investments cash from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows was primarily due to cash flows generated by an increase in net income as a result of the prior year litigation settlement resulting in a net loss for the year ended december  additionally  net income benefited from a tax adjustment to decrease income tax related to a pre filing agreement reached in regarding the deductibility of the settlement 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in cash flows generated by working capital changes of million 
cash used in operating activities for working capital changes was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities for working capital changes of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by working capital changes primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided through changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million primarily due to payments in of prior year variable compensation accruals at amounts exceeding that accrued for the year ended december  and changes in the experience rebate accrual under our contract with the state of texas 
additionally  working capital changes attributable to changes in prepaid expenses  provider and other receivables and other current assets decreased million primarily as a result of the timing of tax payments year over year and the accrual of pharmacy rebates 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change resulted primarily from net purchases of investments during the year ended december  compared to net proceeds from the release of restricted investments held as collateral during the year ended december  we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for to be between approximately million and million related primarily to technological infrastructure development and enhancement of core systems to increase scalability and efficiency 
our investment policies are designed to preserve capital  provide liquidity and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is approximately months excluding our auction rate securities which are discussed below 
we utilize investment vehicles such as auction rate securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  debt securities of government sponsored entities  federally insured corporate bonds  money market funds  municipal bonds and us treasury securities 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on consolidated investments as of december  was approximately 
as of december   we had total cash and investments of approximately billion 
the following table shows the types  percentages and average standard and poor s ratings of our holdings within our investment portfolio at december  average s p rating auction rate securities aa cash  bank deposits and commercial paper a certificates of deposit aaa corporate bonds a debt obligations of government sponsored entities  federally insured corporate bonds  municipal bonds and us treasury securities aaa money market funds aaa aa effective july   we began reporting all of the debt securities in our investment portfolio as available for sale  other than certain auction rate securities subject to a forward contract  discussed below  that continue to be classified as trading securities 
the change resulted in the transfer to available for sale of million in held to maturity securities and million in held to maturity investments on deposit  with unrealized gains of million and million  respectively and the transfer to available for sale of million in held to maturity securities and million in held to maturity investments on deposit  with unrealized losses of million and million  respectively 
the unrealized gains and losses  net of the related tax effects  were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the decision to reclassify the securities as available for sale is intended to provide us with the opportunity to improve liquidity and increase investment returns through prudent investment management while providing financial flexibility in determining whether to hold those securities to maturity 
as of december   million of our investments were comprised of auction rate securities issued by student loan corporations which are public  non profit entities established by various state governments 
liquidity for these auction rate securities historically was provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes and the interest rate was reset at pre determined intervals  usually every or days 
since early  auctions for these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
as we cannot predict the timing of future successful auctions  if any  our auction rate securities are classified as long term investments 
the weighted average life of our auction rate securities portfolio  based on the final maturity  is approximately years 
we currently have the intent to hold our auction rate securities to maturity  if required  or if and when market stability is restored with respect to these investments 
our auction rate securities are classified as either available for sale or trading securities and reflected at fair value 
in periods prior to  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under the current guidance related to fair value measurements 
however  the auction events for these securities failed during early and have not resumed 
observable and relevant market data for valuing auction rate securities is limited at this time 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level during and recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income of million at that time 
for the year ended december   we have recorded an unrealized gain of million to accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of moderate recoveries in fair value for auction rate securities classified as available for sale 
we currently believe that the net unrealized loss position that remains at december  is primarily due to liquidity concerns and not the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers 
in addition  our holdings of auction rate securities represented less than four percent of our total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value 
because we believe that the current decline in fair value is temporary and based primarily on liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our fair value estimates and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
we will re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a forward contract with a registered broker dealer  at no cost to us  for auction rate securities with a fair value of million as of december  this forward contract provides us with the ability to sell these auction rate securities to the registered broker dealer at par within a defined timeframe  beginning june these securities are classified as trading securities because we do not intend to hold these securities until final maturity 
trading securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
a realized gain of million was recorded to earnings for the year ended december   related to these trading securities 
the value of the forward contract of million was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis taking into consideration the creditworthiness of the counterparty to the agreement 
the forward contract is included in other long term assets 
as the trading securities increased in value  a corresponding decrease in fair value for the forward contract of million for the year ended december  was recorded to earnings 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to an increase of million in funds used to repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program partially offset by a million decrease in repayments of borrowings under our credit agreement  which was terminated effective august  we believe that existing cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months 
our debt to total capital ratio at december  was 
the financial markets have experienced periods of volatility and disruption since future volatility and disruption is possible and unpredictable 
in the event we need access to additional capital  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significantly higher than in past periods depending on the market condition and our financial position at the time we pursue additional financing 
the principal of our convertible senior notes may be repaid with proceeds from debt or equity financing  existing cash and investments  or a combination thereof 
if we determine that debt or equity financing is appropriate  our operations at the time we enter the credit or equity markets cannot be predicted and may cause our access to these markets to be limited 
additionally  any disruptions in the credit markets similar to that of the recent recession could further limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry and addressing our future capital requirements 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
this could restrict our ability to acquire new businesses or enter new markets  service or refinance our existing debt  make necessary capital investments  maintain statutory net worth requirements in the states in which we do business  and make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of our business 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos  one hic and one phsp 
hmos  hics and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
the parent company may be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe  as a result  that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has defined risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage that are designed to measure capitalization levels by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from a requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to b requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
eight of our eleven states have adopted rbc as the measure of required surplus 
at december   our consolidated rbc ratio for these states is estimated to be over which compares to the required level of  the level at which regulatory action would be initiated 
in the remaining states  we have approximately times the state required surplus level 
although not all states had adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of our active health plans had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments at december  in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under non cancelable office space leases 
long term obligations 
long term obligations include amounts due under our convertible senior notes which mature may  off balance sheet arrangements we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
effective july   we have caused to be issued a collateralized irrevocable standby letter of credit in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million to meet certain obligations under our medicaid contract in the state of georgia through our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc the letter of credit is collateralized through investments held by amgp georgia managed care company  inc commitments as of december   the company has no commitments 
inflation although healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to reduce the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated financial statements include a certain amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to our significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
in addition  the credit markets experienced significant disruptions in and liquidity on many financial instruments contracted  the creditworthiness of many issuers has fluctuated  and defaults have increased  along with other disruptions 
while we do not believe we have experienced material adverse changes in the value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments  further disruptions could impact the value of these assets and other financial assets we may hold in the future 
there can be no assurance that future changes in interest rates  creditworthiness of issuers  prepayment activity  liquidity available in the market and other general market conditions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity  financial position or cash flows 
as of december   substantially all of our investments were in high quality securities that have historically exhibited good liquidity which include auction rate securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  debt securities of government sponsored entities  federally insured corporate bonds  money market funds  municipal bonds and us treasury securities 
the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk the risk of loss in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing market rates of interest for similar financial instruments 
however  we have the ability to hold fixed maturity investments to maturity 
we rely on the experience and judgment of senior management to monitor and mitigate the effects of market risk 
the allocation among various types of securities is adjusted from time to time based on market conditions  credit conditions  tax policy  fluctuations in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we place the majority of our investments in high quality  liquid securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as of december   an increase of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
the above changes in fair value are impacted by securities in our portfolio that have a call provision feature 
we believe this fair value presentation is indicative of our market risk because it evaluates each investment based on its individual characteristics 
consequently  the fair value presentation does not assume that each investment reacts identically based on a change in interest rates
