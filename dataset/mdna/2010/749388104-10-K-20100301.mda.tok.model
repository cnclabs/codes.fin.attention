we reach our target consumers through multiple channels of distribution supporting more than  retail outlets throughout north america  europe  australia  asia pacific and south america 
our product categories include i mother  infant and toddler products and ii preschool  youth and adult products 
we market a significant portion of our products with licenses from other parties  and we are currently a party to more than license agreements 
sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of mother  infant and toddler products and preschool  youth and adult products  and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels  including chain retailers  specialty retailers  wholesalers and oem dealers 
for the years ended december   and  sales to chain retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed primarily in north america  europe  australia  asia pacific and south america 
international sales  defined as sales outside of north america  constituted  and  of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to increase in local currencies as we expand our geographic reach 
net sales in our international segment decreased for the year ended december   which includes a negative impact of related to changes from currency exchange rates 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers 
our top three customers  toys r us babies r us  target and wal mart  combined accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
over the last three years  each of these three customers accounted for between and of our net sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of the company s net sales in any of the years ended december   or we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany  with credit terms generally ranging from to days  or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
returns and allowances on an annual basis have ranged from to of our net sales over the last three years 
returns and allowances for the years ended december   and  include million  million and million  respectively  of items related to the recalls  causing returns and allowances to be at a higher end of the annual range in expenses 
our products are manufactured by third parties  principally located in china 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchases of finished products  which accounted for  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our cost of sales primarily includes tooling depreciation  freight in from suppliers  inventory reserves  concept and design expenses  employee compensation  expense related to stock based payment arrangements and certain recall related items 
our purchases of finished products from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
any material increase in the value of the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar would increase our suppliers expenses  and therefore  the cost of our products  which could adversely affect our profitability 
a material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses  and therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
additionally  as certain of our foreign subsidiaries purchase inventory  effectively in us dollars  any material increase in the us dollar relative to our foreign subsidiaries local currencies would increase our expenses  and therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
if our suppliers experience increased costs for raw materials  labor or other items  and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
for example  an increase in the price of zinc  a key component in die cast products  and increased costs in china  primarily for labor  taxes and currency  reduced our gross margins in and during  we experienced raw material and freight cost reductions 
in  we expect our input costs to increase from levels 
our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
our mother  infant and toddler products category has higher sales of non licensed products that carry lower selling prices and gross margins than our preschool  youth and adult products category 
additionally  individual product lines within each category carry gross margins that vary significantly and cause quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of these individual shipments throughout the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of royalties  employee compensation  advertising and marketing  freight out and other distribution costs  sales commissions  expense related to stock based compensation arrangements and certain recall related items 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
in  aggregate royalties by product ranged up to of our net sales price 
royalty expense was of our net sales for each of the years ended december   and sales commissions range up to of the net sales price  and are generally paid quarterly to our external sales representative organizations 
sales subject to commissions represented  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales commission expense was  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented an operating cost reduction plan

in addition  the company enacted plans to reduce non payroll operating expenses in in connection with this plan and other personnel changes  the company incurred severance and certain non cash charges of million  net of tax  in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of this cost reduction plan  and to a lesser extent  lower variable sales related costs  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  seasonality 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  which is typical of many companies in our industry 
our business is highly seasonal primarily due to the high consumer demand for our toy products during the year end holiday season 
approximately of our net sales for the three years ended december   were generated in the second half of the year 
as a result  our working capital  mainly inventory and accounts receivable  is typically highest during the third and fourth quarters and lowest during the first and second quarters

non gaap financial information this section includes non gaap financial information consisting of net sales excluding recall related items and excluding discontinued product lines  adjusted ebitda as described in more detail in the next section and diluted earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude certain items 
internally  we use this non gaap financial information for the following purposes financial and operational decision making  evaluating period to period results and making comparisons of our results with those of our competitors 
management believes that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because this information may allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of the company s results 
because the sales related to discontinued product lines have decreased significantly as the company sells off the remaining inventory and recall related items have decreased significantly  the company believes that the presentation of this non gaap information enhances an investor s ability to make period to period comparisons of the company s operating results 
this information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for the gaap results 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of the other items set forth in calculation of adjusted ebitda above that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance

on november   the company entered into a credit facility to replace its previous credit facility 
the credit facility is comprised of a term loan and provides for borrowings up to million under a revolving line of credit 
the total borrowing capacity available under the credit facility is subject to a formula based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the term loan and the revolving line of credit both have a scheduled maturity date of november  under this credit facility  the term loan and the revolving line of credit bear interest  at the company s option  at a base rate or at libor  plus applicable margins  which are based on the company s leverage ratio 
applicable margins vary between and on libor borrowings and and on base rate borrowings 
at december   the applicable margins in effect were for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings

at december   the commitment fee in effect was per annum 
under the terms of this credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends  buy back shares of its common stock  incur additional debt and make acquisitions above certain amounts 
the credit facility also includes a clean down provision that limits the maximum amount of borrowings under the revolving line of credit for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months 
the clean down provision limits are million for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months of  and million for a period of consecutive days during the first four calendar months of the company has met its clean down provision for the year  as of the date of this filing

as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under these credit facilities 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt estimated future interest payments on long term debt minimum guaranteed royalty payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations estimated future interest payments on our long term debt were based upon the interest rates in effect at december   and the balance outstanding on the term loan  and the unused portion of the line of credit at december  the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain

the company received net proceeds of million and intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate and working capital purposes  including potential repayment of long term debt and the funding of future acquisitions 
as we anticipate our working capital levels in will be relatively consistent with  and there are no scheduled debt repayments in  we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated operating needs in any significant future acquisitions  including up front licensing payments for new products  may require additional debt or equity financing 
due to seasonal increases in demand for our toy products  our working capital is typically highest during the third and fourth quarters  and our debt levels are highest during the third quarter 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during any of the years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the company s allowance is based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable aging and customer disputes 
the company maintains credit insurance for some of its major domestic customers  and the amount of this insurance covers a limited amount of the total amount of its accounts receiveable 
the company will continue to proactively review its credit risks and adjust its customer terms to reflect the current environment 
inventory 
inventory  which consists primarily of finished goods  has been written down for excess quantities and obsolescence  and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost reasonably approximates the first in  first out method and includes all costs necessary to bring inventory to its existing condition and location 
market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value 
inventory write downs are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
the company s management uses estimates to record these write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  length of time on hand  sales projections and order bookings 
changes in public and consumer preferences and demand for product or changes in customer buying patterns and inventory management  as well as discontinuance of products or product lines  could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets have been reviewed for impairment based on the requirements under the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
this topic requires that an impairment loss be recognized whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs the entity would recognize as an expense when incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been reviewed for impairment based on the requirements under the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
under this topic  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather tested at least annually for impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge  writing off its entire balance of goodwill 
in the fourth quarters of and  the company recorded other intangible asset impairment charges in the north america segment of million and million  respectively 
the next scheduled annual test for impairment on its other indefinite lived intangibles will be as of october   and will be completed in the fourth quarter of the company s management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss could exist 
an interim test for impairment is performed if a triggering event occurs suggesting possible impairment 
testing for impairment requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets 
various uncertainties  including changes in consumer preferences  ability to maintain related licenses  deterioration in the political environment  adverse conditions in the capital markets or changes in general economic conditions  could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
income taxes 
the company records current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
management considers all available evidence in evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets and records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets as needed 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate carry forward periods to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets  except for those deferred tax assets for which an allowance has been provided 
management considers certain tax exposures and all available evidence when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the tax related balances may be required 
estimates for such tax contingencies are classified in other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
product recalls 
the company establishes a reserve for a product recall on a product specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable 
facts underlying the recall  including  among others  estimates of retailer inventory returns  consumer replacement costs  fines and penalties  and shipping costs are considered when establishing a product recall reserve 
in and  the company also considered additional replacement costs or refunds  donations  notice charges  claims administration  licensor indemnification claims and plaintiffs legal fees related to settlement of litigation related to the recalls 
the company s legal costs to defend recall related matters are expensed as incurred 
when facts or circumstances become known that would indicate that the recall reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall expenses  the reserve is adjusted  as appropriate 
accrued allowances 
the company ordinarily accepts returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from the company  the company may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
other allowances can also be issued primarily for defective merchandise  volume programs and co op advertising 
all allowances are accrued throughout the year  as sales are recorded 
the allowances are based on the terms of the various programs in effect  however  management also takes into consideration historical trends and specific customer and product information when making its estimates 
for the volume programs  the company generally sets a volume target for the year with each participating customer and issues the discount if the target is achieved 
the allowance for the volume program is accrued throughout the year  and if it becomes clear to management that the target for the participating customer will not be reached  the company will change the estimate for that customer as required 
accrued royalties 
royalties are accrued based on the provisions in licensing agreements for amounts due on net sales during the period  as well as management estimates for additional royalty exposures 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
royalty expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and sars granted under the stock incentive plan is estimated on the date of grant based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the company calculates the expected volatility factor using company specific volatility as the company believes that its actual volatility is a good indicator of expected future results 
the company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercise and employee departure behavior in the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected term of stock options and sars granted represents the period of time that stock options and sars granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for the period within the contractual term of the stock option or sar is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards granted under the stock incentive plan is calculated either using the market price on the grant date or the market price on the last day of the reported period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with the company s credit facility and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the company s foreign operations 
based on the company s interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings at december   a one percentage point increase in average interest rates on the company s borrowings would increase future interest expense by less than million per month and a five percentage point increase would increase future interest expense by approximately million per month 
the company determined these amounts based on million of variable rate borrowings at december   multiplied by and  respectively  and divided by twelve 
the company is currently not using any interest rate collars  hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
as a result  any increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate borrowings would increase interest expense and reduce net income 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  with of net sales for the year ended december   denominated in british pounds sterling  australian dollars  euros and canadian dollars 
the company s purchases of finished goods from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
any material increase in the value of the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar would increase our suppliers expenses  and therefore  the cost of our products  which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
the hong kong dollar is currently pegged to the us dollar 
if the hong kong dollar ceased to be pegged to the us dollar  a material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses  and therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the hong kong dollar for the year ended december   would have changed the total dollar amount of our gross profit by 
the company is also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds or other transactions denominated in british pounds sterling  australian dollars  canadian dollars or euros from its foreign subsidiaries to the united states  such as for purchases of inventory by certain of our foreign subsidiaries  effectively in us dollars 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the british pound sterling  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar for the year ended december   would have changed the total dollar amount of our gross profit by  and  respectively 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the translation of financial reporting denominated in the british pound sterling  the australian dollar or the euro for the year ended december   individually would not have had a significant impact on the company s net income
