advertising  marketing  and promotion advertising  marketing and promotional programs are integral parts of our global strategy to build brand equity  raise global brand relevance and awareness  infuse our brands with excitement and stimulate consumer demand for our products worldwide 
our advertising  marketing and promotional efforts consist of integrated marketing activities  including primarily internet and print advertising  enhanced in store displays and merchandising techniques executed in partnership with various wholesale customers  public relations and brand communications focused on our innovative apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment technologies  performance features and styling 
our key brand messages are reinforced consistently at our wholesale customers stores using concept shops  focus areas and other visual merchandising displays dedicated exclusively 
table of contents to selling our merchandise on a year round basis 
we also reinforce our marketing and product innovation messages through selected sponsorships of individual outdoor athletes  personalities and teams who serve as inspirational models of excellence to consumers and also through sponsorship of selected outdoor events and competitions 
working capital utilization we design  develop  market and distribute our products  but do not own or operate our own manufacturing facilities 
as a result  most of our capital is invested in short term working capital assets  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable from customers  and finished goods inventory 
at december   working capital assets accounted for approximately of total assets 
as a result  the degree to which we efficiently utilize our working capital assets can have a significant impact on our profitability and return on invested capital 
the overall goals of our working capital management efforts are to maintain the minimum level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers to satisfy end consumer demand  and to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers 
demand planning and inventory management as a branded consumer products company  inventory represents one of the largest and riskiest capital commitments in our business model 
we design and develop our seasonal product lines to months in advance of their availability to consumers in retail stores 
as a result  our ability to estimate seasonal consumer demand and to purchase appropriate levels of finished goods from our suppliers can significantly affect our sales  gross margins and profitability 
for this reason  we maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems  processes and personnel in support of our ongoing demand planning efforts 
the goals of our demand planning efforts are to purchase an adequate amount of inventory to service a targeted percentage of total consumer demand while minimizing excess inventory to avoid the negative effect that liquidating excess  end of season goods at discounted prices has on our gross margins  profitability and brand strength 
in order to manage inventory risk  we use incentive discounts to encourage our wholesale customers to place advance orders approximately four to six months in advance of scheduled delivery 
we use those advance orders  together with forecasted demand from our own retail stores  market trends  historical data  customer and sales feedback and several other important factors  to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our suppliers around the world 
from the time of initial order through production  receipt and delivery  we attempt to manage our inventory to reduce risk 
our inventory management efforts cannot entirely eliminate inventory risk due to the inherently unpredictable nature of consumer demand  the ability of customers to cancel their orders prior to shipment  and other variables that affect our customers ability to take delivery of their orders when originally scheduled 
in addition  we build calculated amounts of speculative inventory to support estimated at once orders from customers and auto replenishment orders on certain long lived styles 
credit and collection we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of each customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist us in scheduling production with our suppliers and delivering seasonal products to our customers on time  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before peak seasonal shipping periods 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in order to manage the inherent risks of customer receivables  we maintain and continue to invest in information systems  processes and personnel skilled in credit and collections 
in some markets and with some customers we use credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss 

table of contents sourcing and manufacturing virtually all of our products are manufactured to our specifications by independent factories located outside the united states 
we believe that the use of independent factories enables us to substantially limit our capital expenditures and avoid the costs and risks associated with owning and operating large production facilities and managing large labor forces 
we also believe that the use of independent factories greatly increases our production capacity  maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing 
we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing contracts  however  we believe that our long term relationships with various factories will help to ensure that adequate sources are available to produce a sufficient supply of goods in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future 
in  our four largest apparel factory groups accounted for approximately of our total global apparel production and our four largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately of our total global footwear production 
in addition  a single vendor supplies substantially all of the zippers used in our products 
these companies  however  have multiple factory locations  many of which are in different countries  thus reducing the risk that unfavorable conditions at a single factory or location will have a material adverse effect on our business 
our apparel is manufactured in more than countries with vietnam and china accounting for approximately of our apparel production 
our footwear is manufactured in three countries  with china and vietnam accounting for approximately of our footwear production 
we maintain manufacturing liaison offices in a total of seven asian countries 
we also maintain a manufacturing liaison office in richmond  california 
personnel in these manufacturing liaison offices are direct employees of columbia  and are responsible for overseeing production at our independent factories 
we believe that having employees physically located in these regions enhances our ability to monitor factories for compliance with our policies  procedures and standards related to quality  delivery  pricing and labor practices 
our quality assurance process is designed to ensure that our products meet the highest quality standards 
we believe that our quality assurance process is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products 
backlog we typically receive the majority of our advance orders from our wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons by march and september  respectively  based upon customer ordering deadlines that we establish 
as a result  our order backlog at each of march and september has historically been a meaningful indicator of anticipated sales to wholesale customers and independent distributors for the corresponding future period 
accordingly  we disclose our backlog at march and at september in our quarterly reports on form q for those respective periods  rather than at december generally  orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
our owned retail stores and e commerce websites do not participate in the advance order program 
accordingly  to the extent that order cancellations from wholesale customers and independent distributors remain at elevated levels and our retail and e commerce sales grow to represent a larger proportion of our total sales  our advance order backlog may become less indicative of anticipated sales for corresponding future periods 
competition the markets for sportswear  outerwear  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from numerous and varying competitors 
some of our large wholesale customers also pose a significant competitive threat by marketing apparel  footwear and equipment under their own private labels 
our licensees operate in very competitive markets  such as those for watches  bicycles  leather outerwear and socks 
in addition  our own retail channels expose us to competitors who operate retail stores in outlet malls and key metropolitan markets  as well as competitors who sell product online 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for active sportswear  outerwear  footwear  accessories and equipment are brand strength  product innovation  product design  functionality  durability and price 

table of contents government regulation many of our imports are subject to existing or potential governmental tariff and non tariff barriers to trade  such as import duties and potential safeguard measures that may limit the quantity of various types of goods that may be imported into the united states and other countries 
these trade barriers often represent a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
our products are also subject to domestic and foreign product safety and environmental standards  laws and other regulations  which are increasingly restrictive and complex 
although we diligently monitor these standards and restrictions  the united states or other countries may impose new or adjusted quotas  duties  safety requirements  material restrictions  or other restrictions or regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
employees at december  we had the equivalent of  full time employees 
of these employees   were based in the united states  in asia  in europe and in canada

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
our success depends on our business strategies our business strategies are to achieve sustainable  profitable growth by creating innovative products  elevating consumer perception of our brands  increasing consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our products  creating compelling retail environments  and building stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time 
we intend to pursue these strategies across extended product categories and in a growing number of geographic markets 
we face many challenges in implementing our business strategies 
for example  expansion of our direct to consumer business has required significant investments  yet  in the current macro economic environment of economic uncertainty and weak consumer demand  this expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing demand for our products 
our ability to expand our global footwear business and european business may also be significantly limited as a result of global economic conditions and a general weakness in global consumer demand 
the success of our retail and e commerce initiatives depends on our ability to adapt our internal processes to facilitate direct to consumer sales  to effectively manage retail store and e commerce inventory  to hire  retain and train personnel capable of managing retail and e commerce operations  to identify and negotiate favorable terms for retail locations  to effectively manage construction  opening  and ongoing operations of stores globally and to manage the operation of our e commerce platform effectively 
the failure to implement our business strategies successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents our business strategies and related increased expenditures could also cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset our increased spending with increased sales or gross margins  or comparable reductions in other operating costs 
if our sales decline or fail to grow as planned and we fail to sufficiently reduce our operating expenses  our profitability will decline 
this could result in a decision to delay  reduce  modify or terminate our strategic business initiatives  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we continue to expand into international markets where we have little sales or distribution experience and where our brands are not yet widely known 
expanding into new markets involves  among other things  gaining consumer acceptance and establishing and protecting intellectual property rights 
attracting superior retail channel partners and improving the sales productivity of our customers each depend on various factors  including the strength of our brand names  our ability to design and manufacture innovative products  competitive conditions  the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of terms with customers 
future terms with customers may be less favorable to us than those under which we now operate 
large wholesale customers in particular increasingly seek to transfer various costs of business to their vendors  such as the cost of lost profits from promotional activity and product price markdowns  which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs 
to implement our business strategy  we must continue to modify various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
changes in our business may place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution and other resources  and we may have operating difficulties as a result 
for example  our strategic initiatives  including the implementation of our retail store and e commerce strategies  require significant management attention and corporate resources 
these business initiatives involve many risks and uncertainties that  if not managed effectively  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty we are a consumer products company and are highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending patterns and the purchasing patterns of our wholesale customers as they attempt to match their seasonal purchase volumes to volatile consumer demand 
in addition  as we have expanded our base of retail stores  we have increased our direct exposure to the risks associated with volatile and unpredictable consumer discretionary spending patterns 
as global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains  trends in consumer discretionary spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future and credit constraints 
consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets  or may decline  when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and our emea region 
our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by volatility in global production costs our product costs are subject to substantial fluctuation based on changes in labor markets in certain asian countries  particularly china and vietnam  interest rates  currency exchange rates  global oil markets  production capacity at independent factories  and general economic conditions 
for example  volatility in global oil markets has resulted in fluctuating fuel and product prices and caused costs to produce our products through independent contractors to change  sometimes significantly 
because we price our products in advance and the external cost changes may be difficult to predict  we may not be able to adjust our pricing structure in a timely manner in order to remain competitive  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  since the majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets  our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and volatile fuel costs can result in rapidly changing transportation costs 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers sluggish economies and consumer uncertainty regarding future economic prospects in our key markets are having an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  some of whom have filed or may file for protection under bankruptcy laws  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of the customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation or reduced availability of credit insurance coverage when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant wholesale customers have liquidated or reorganized  while others have had financial difficulties in the past and have recently experienced tightened credit markets and declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis  which in turn has an adverse effect on our business 
we may reduce our level of business with customers experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace that business with other customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by global credit market conditions economic downturns and economic uncertainty generally affect global credit markets 
our vendors  customers and other participants in our supply chain may require access to credit markets in order to do business 
credit market conditions may slow our collection efforts as customers find it more difficult to obtain necessary financing  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this could result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 
credit conditions may impair our vendors ability to finance the purchase of raw materials or general working capital needs to support our production requirements  resulting in a delay or non receipt of inventory shipments during key seasons 
historically we have limited our reliance on long term debt to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and investing activity requirements 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash  expected operating cash flows and credit facilities  but if the need arises to finance additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products many factors may significantly affect demand for our products  including  among other things  economic conditions  fashion trends  consumer preferences and weather  making it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products and our future results of operations 
to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place some orders for our products with independent factories prior to receiving all of our customers orders and we maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
in addition  customers are generally allowed to cancel orders prior to shipment with sufficient notice 
during periods of weak economic conditions we may experience a significant increase in the volume of order cancellations by our customers  including cancellations resulting from the bankruptcy  liquidation or contraction of certain customers operations 
particularly in light of current economic conditions  we may not be able to sell all of the products we have ordered from independent factories or that we have in our inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices through discount retail channels  which could have a material adverse effect on our brand image  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for certain demand planning functions  we rely on manual processes and judgment that are difficult to control and are subject to human error 

table of contents conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our independent factories are unable to supply products when we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might prevent us from fulfilling customer orders  delay shipments to customers  negatively affect customer relationships  and diminish our ability to build brand loyalty 
we may be adversely affected by weather conditions our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions 
a significant portion of the sales of our sportswear  outerwear  footwear  accessories and equipment is dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products 
periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring and summer may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for example  in spring  unseasonably cool weather in the united states caused customers to delay  and in some cases reduce or cancel  orders for our sportswear and footwear  which had an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season may negatively affect orders in future seasons  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad 
these risks include the effects of foreign laws and regulations  changes in consumer preferences  foreign currency fluctuations  political unrest  terrorist acts  military operations  disruptions or delays in shipments  disease outbreaks and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
these factors  among others  may affect our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  and our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
as we expand our operations in geographic scope and product categories  we anticipate intellectual property disputes will increase as well  making it more expensive and challenging to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and to defend against claims of infringement by others 
as a global company  we determine our income tax liability in various competing tax jurisdictions based on a careful analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities 
these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits 
although we accrue for uncertain tax positions  our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings  which by their nature cannot be predicted with certainty 
unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes  fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate  adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  anti dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for sportswear  outerwear  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensed products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment companies 

table of contents retailers who are our customers often pose our most significant competitive threat by marketing apparel  footwear and equipment under their own private labels 
for example  in the united states  several of our largest customers have developed significant private label brands during the past decade that compete directly with our products 
these retailers have assumed an increasing degree of inventory risk in their private label products and  as a result  may first cancel advance orders with us in order to manage their own inventory levels downward during weak economic cycles 
we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent factories that produce our products and for import quota capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than us  have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have  and have achieved greater brand strength than we have 
increased competition may result in reduced access to production capacity  reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales  or reductions in our profit margins  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by retailer consolidation when our wholesale customers combine their operations through mergers  acquisitions  or other transactions  their consolidated order volume may decrease while their bargaining power and the competitive threat they pose by marketing products under their own private labels may increase 
some of our significant customers have consolidated their operations in the past  which in turn has had a negative effect on our business 
as many retailers face increased financial pressure from significant decreases in consumer spending and continued economic uncertainty  we expect retailer consolidation to continue  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in fashion trends may have a greater impact than in the past as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas 
we also face risks because our business requires us and our customers to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by retailers  we must generally place a significant portion of our seasonal production orders with our independent factories before we have received all of a season s orders  and orders may be cancelled by customers before shipment 
if we or our customers fail to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences  we may have lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our use and protection of intellectual property rights our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights 
counterfeiting activities typically increase as brand recognition increases  especially in markets outside the united states 
increased instances of counterfeit manufacture and sales may adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to successfully challenge use of those rights by other parties 
we also license our proprietary rights to third parties 
failure to choose appropriate licensees and licensed product 
table of contents categories may dilute or harm our brand image 
actions or decisions in the management of our intellectual property portfolio may affect the strength of the brand  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with patent  trademark and trade dress disputes  as we focus on innovation in our product lines  extend our brand into new product categories and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we may become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties including third party trademark  copyright and patent rights 
an increasing number of our products include technologies and or designs for which we have obtained or applied for patent protection 
failure to successfully obtain and maintain patents on these innovations could negatively affect our ability to market and sell our products 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend against such claims or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property litigation may be costly and may divert management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
this may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our distribution facilities our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties  including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution centers in portland  oregon and robards  kentucky  in canada  we rely primarily on our distribution facilities in strathroy  ontario  and in europe  we rely primarily on our distribution center in cambrai  france 
our distribution facilities in the united states and france are highly automated  which means that their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  and other system failures 
risks associated with upgrading or expanding these facilities may significantly disrupt or increase the cost of our operations 
for example  in addition to supporting our traditional wholesale business  our existing distribution facilities have been modified to enable them to also support our new e commerce sales 
failure to successfully maintain and update these modifications could disrupt our wholesale and e commerce shipments and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our current distribution facilities are designed to handle significantly greater volumes of product shipments than our business is currently generating  especially our european distribution center in cambrai  france 
the fixed costs associated with owning  operating and maintaining these large  highly automated distribution centers during a period of economic weakness and declining sales could result in lower operating efficiencies and financial deleverage 
this fixed cost structure may make it difficult for us to maintain profitability if sales volumes continue to decline for an extended period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our distribution facilities may also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes which are known to occur in the northwestern united states or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that may be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we rely on our highly customized information management systems our business is increasingly reliant on information technology 
information systems are used across our supply chain and retail operations  from design to distribution and sales  and are used as a method of 
table of contents communication between employees  with our subsidiaries and liaison offices overseas  as well as with our customers and retail stores 
we also rely on our information systems to allocate resources  develop demand plans and forecast operating results 
system failures  breaches of confidential information  or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  programming errors  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or our failure to properly maintain systems redundancy  or to protect  repair  maintain  or upgrade our systems 
any breach or interruption of critical business information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our primary enterprise resource planning system is highly customized to our business 
as a result  the availability of internal and external resources with the expertise to maintain our enterprise resource planning system is limited 
we may experience difficulties if we transition to new or upgraded systems  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as our personnel become familiar with new systems 
in addition  transitioning to new or upgraded systems could require significant capital investments 
difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as we implement our direct to consumer initiatives and plan for future growth  our customized enterprise resource planning system may inhibit our ability to operate efficiently  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  our enterprise resource planning system may not be compatible with other systems to support desired functionality for our operations 
we may be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations although the majority of our product purchases are denominated in us dollars  the cost of these products may be affected by the relative changes in the value of the local currency of the manufacturer 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the us dollar 
because the primary currency of many of our subsidiaries is not the us dollar  we are exposed to potentially material gains or losses from the remeasurement of monetary transactions into the us dollar 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of the independent factories that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
as a result  currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our investments may be adversely affected by an economic downturn or economic uncertainty our investment portfolio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
changes in market conditions  such as those that accompany an economic downturn or economic uncertainty  may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio  perhaps significantly 
our ability to find diversified investments that are both safe and liquid and that provide a reasonable return may be impaired  resulting in lower interest income  less diversification  longer investment maturities and or higher other than temporary impairments 
we may be adversely affected by labor disruptions our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced  shipping ports  transportation carriers  retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing and importing seasons  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 

table of contents we depend on independent factories our products are produced by independent factories worldwide 
we do not operate or own any production facilities 
although we enter into purchase order commitments with these independent factories each season  we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing commitments with them 
because of these factors  independent factories may fail to perform as expected or our competitors may obtain production or quota capacities that effectively limit or eliminate the availability of these resources to us 
if an independent manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards or if we are unable to obtain necessary production or quota capacities  we may miss delivery deadlines or incur additional costs  which may result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries  a reduction in purchase prices  or increased costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
reliance on independent factories also creates quality control risks 
a failure in our quality control program may result in diminished product quality  which may result in increased order cancellations and returns  decreased consumer demand for our products  or product recalls  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
finally  if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  we may be subject to significant negative publicity that could result in long term damage to our brand image  consumer demand for our products may decrease  and under some circumstances we may be subject to liability for the independent manufacturer s practices  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on key suppliers some of the materials that we use may be available from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources  and zippers are supplied by one manufacturer 
from time to time  we have difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe that we can identify and qualify additional independent factories to produce these materials as necessary  there are no guarantees that additional independent factories will be available 
in addition  depending on the timing  any changes may result in increased costs or production delays  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key managers  designers  sales people and others 
we face intense competition for these individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around portland  oregon 
we may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business is affected by seasonality our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor apparel industry 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our product mix is weighted substantially toward the fall season  resulting in sales and profits being highest in the third calendar quarter 
we expect the expansion of our retail operations to have a modest effect on the seasonality of our business  increasing the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control and that are discussed elsewhere in this section  may adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

table of contents our products are subject to increasing product regulations and we face risks of product liability and warranty claims our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex domestic and foreign product labeling and performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations 
these requirements could result in greater expense associated with compliance efforts  and failure to comply with these regulations could result in a delay  non delivery or mandated recall or destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons or in other financial penalties 
significant or continuing noncompliance with these standards and laws could harm our reputation and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our products are used in outdoor activities  sometimes in severe conditions 
product recalls or product liability claims in the future  resulting from the alleged failure of our products  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of our products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship 
we maintain a warranty reserve for future warranty claims  but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve  which may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our common stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market  which is likely to continue to have significant price and volume fluctuations that may adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
factors such as general market conditions  fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or announcements by us or our competitors may also cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
insiders control a majority of our common stock and may sell shares three related shareholders  timothy boyle  gertrude boyle and sarah bany  beneficially own a majority of our common stock 
as a result  if acting together  they can effectively control matters requiring shareholder approval without the cooperation of other shareholders 
shares held by these three insiders are available for resale  subject to the requirements of  and the rules under  the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the sale or the prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

forward looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or market position  including any statements regarding anticipated sales across markets  distribution channels and product categories  access to raw materials and factory capacity  financing and working capital requirements and resources and our exposure to market risk associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these forward looking statements  and others we make from time to time  are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements  including the risks described above in item a  risk factors 
we do not undertake any duty to either update forward looking statements after the date they are made or conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
our business as one of the largest outdoor apparel and footwear companies in the world  we design  develop  market and distribute active outdoor apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment under the columbia  mountain hardwear  sorel  montrail  and pacific trail brands 
our products are sold through a mix of wholesale distribution channels  independent distributors  our own retail channels and licensees 
the popularity of outdoor activities and changing design trends affect consumer desire for our products 
therefore  we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings  developing new products with innovative performance features and designs  and by creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to drive consumer awareness and demand 
failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
business environment like other branded consumer product companies  our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns 
our net sales volumes have been negatively affected by the volatility of the global economy and its impact on consumer purchasing behavior  and retailers behavior related to advance orders  replenishment orders  order cancellations and seasonal reorders 
consequences of the economic environment during the past months include tightening of credit for some of our wholesale customers and consumers and a significant slowing of retail sales 
this has resulted in  and could continue to result in  liquidations and reorganization of several of our wholesale customers and a more cautious approach by many of our wholesale customers when placing advance orders for seasonal products 
it also affects decisions regarding reducing  delaying delivery of  or cancelling advance orders prior to shipment 
in addition  the effects of foreign currency exchange rates may amplify any revenue declines if the us dollar strengthens compared to local currencies in our direct markets  as we have experienced in some markets 
we believe that we have appropriately factored our historical experiences  incremental sales from our new retail stores and e commerce platform  and the estimated effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates into our outlook for fiscal year however  unfavorable and unprecedented global economic conditions have increased the uncertainty of our planning and forecasts 
in this challenging economic environment  we are also mindful of our reliance on the overall financial health of our wholesale customers and their ability to continue to access credit markets to fund their inventory purchases and day to day operations 

table of contents the business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty  with a number of variables that we rely on for planning purposes moving in opposing directions and making it more difficult to predict the future 
factors that could significantly affect our outlook include fluctuating currency exchange rates  changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales  changes in the volume of order cancellations and reorders  incremental sales through our expanding retail and e commerce operations  which are not included in backlog  changes in consumer activity and sales fluctuations in our retail stores  and changes in spending levels related to strategic initiatives and cost containment efforts 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty and despite current global economic conditions  we are committed to our strategies  which focus on product innovation and using our portfolio of outdoor brands to meet the needs of outdoor consumers 
our direct to consumer initiatives include our retail expansion plans and e commerce platforms 
we believe that our commitment to invest in these strategies  while maintaining a well developed sourcing and distribution infrastructure  positions us well to establish sustainable platforms that will support long term growth and profitability 
overview the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources  including known trends and uncertainties identified by management  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december highlights for the year ended december  include the following net sales decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with negatively affected the consolidated net sales comparison by approximately one percentage point 
the decrease in net sales was primarily the result of decreased sales of columbia branded products in the emea region and canada  partially offset by increased sales of columbia branded products in the united states and the laap region 
difficult economic conditions worldwide negatively affected our net sales during as initial orders for our wholesale businesses declined for the spring and fall selling seasons 
in addition  customer order cancellation rates were higher and reorder rates were lower for our spring selling season  with some improvement in cancellation and reorder rates for our fall selling season

spring wholesale backlog for the united states and canada was essentially flat compared to the decrease in orders  categorically  was driven primarily by a decline in orders of columbia branded sportswear 
although we cannot predict with certainty any future results  our reported wholesale backlog is one indicator of our anticipated wholesale net sales for the spring selling season 
many factors  however  could cause actual sales to differ materially from reported wholesale backlog  including the potential cancellation of orders by customers  which was significant for spring products  changes in the volume of closeout products sales  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and macroeconomic conditions 
in addition  we expect incremental sales through our direct to consumer operations  which are not included in wholesale backlog  to affect actual sales comparisons for the spring season 
our spring wholesale backlog should not be used as a sole indicator of  or in forecasting  sales beyond the spring selling season 
gross profit decreased basis points to in from in gross profit margins contracted primarily as a result of a higher volume of close out product sales at lower gross margins and unfavorable hedge rates 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to initial investment and incremental operating costs in support of our direct to consumer initiatives and increased incentive compensation and professional fees  partially offset by reduced advertising and bad debt expense

at december   no balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash  operating cash flows and credit facilities 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and exchange rate movements on non us dollar currency denominated assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should result in an appropriate level of protection against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we do not engage in speculative trading in any financial market 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in exchange rates 
we focus on anticipated cash flows resulting from firmly and non firmly committed inventory purchases and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
we manage this risk primarily by using currency forward  option and swap contracts 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in european euros  canadian dollars  japanese yen and korean won 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the euro  canadian dollar  yen and won exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we did not have any long term debt obligations at december  or we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit since the interest is indexed to various reference rates such as prime and libor 
at december  and  our bank lines of credit did not have an outstanding balance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the provision for potential excess  close out and slow moving inventory  product warranty  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates  the development and selection of these accounting estimates  and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 

table of contents revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment to  or upon receipt by  the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and e commerce revenues are recorded upon shipment to the customer 
in some countries outside of the united states where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly in our western european wholesale business  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to five days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
over the three year period ended december   our actual annual sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers have averaged approximately two percent of net sales 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  standby letters of credit  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
current credit and market conditions may slow our collection efforts as customers experience increased difficulty in accessing credit and paying their obligations  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable and increased bad debt expense 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and results in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we evaluate our inventory on hand considering our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience to identify excess  close out or slow moving inventory and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
when we evaluate our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical claim rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
long lived assets long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset or asset group to determine whether a potential impairment exists 
when reviewing for retail store impairment  identifiable cash flows are measured at the individual store level 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
our evaluations of impairment require estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value  if any  attributable to assets being tested 
impairment charges for long lived assets are included in sg a expense 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our uncertain tax positions 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
changes in any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate  adjusted for discrete items  if any  that are taken into account in the relevant period 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year to date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate stock based compensation for stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
further  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
