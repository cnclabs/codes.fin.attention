overview firstcity is a financial services company that engages in two major business segments portfolio asset acquisition and resolution and special situations platform 
the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business has been the company s core business segment since it commenced operations in in the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business  the company acquires portfolios of performing and non performing loans and other assets collectively  portfolio assets or portfolios  generally at a discount to their legal principal balances or appraised values  and services and resolves such portfolio assets in an effort to maximize the present value of the ultimate cash recoveries 
through its special situations platform  the company provides investment capital to privately held middle market companies through flexible capital structuring arrangements to generate an attractive risk adjusted return 
these capital investments primarily take the form of senior and junior financing arrangements  but also include direct equity investments  common equity warrants  distressed debt transactions  and leveraged buyouts 
the declines in global economic conditions that began in continued through despite the challenging economic environment  firstcity recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in 
revenue streams generated by the company s earning assets and servicing platform positively impacted 
table of contents earnings in as revenues increased to million in compared to million in the company s revenues in included million of gains and income from portfolio assets  million of interest income and gains from loans receivable  and million of revenue attributable to our majority owned railroad operations

in addition to its portfolio asset acquisitions in  firstcity invested million in the form of sba loan originations and advances  million the form of equity investments european acquisition partnerships  and million of other investments 
firstcity was also involved in million of debt and equity investments in under its special situations platform firstcity denver of which firstcity s investment share was million 
firstcity s total investment level in was million compared to million in subsequent to december   the company was involved in acquiring million of portfolio assets with a face value of approximately million of which firstcity s investment share was million and invested million in the form of debt and equity investments 
at december   the carrying value of firstcity s earning assets primarily portfolio assets  equity investments  loans receivable  and entity level earning assets approximated million compared to million a year ago 
the global distribution of firstcity s earning assets at carrying value at december  included million in the united states  million in europe  and million in latin america 
net impairment provisions the company incurred million of net impairment provisions in including million in the fourth quarter of comprised of million of net provisions recorded to our consolidated loans and portfolios  and million as our share of net impairment provisions recorded to loans and portfolios held in our unconsolidated acquisition partnerships 
the global distribution of the million net impairment provisions recorded by the company in includes million in the united states  million in latin america  and million in europe 
these impairment provisions were attributed primarily to declines in values of loan collateral and real estate assets in our domestic loans and portfolios 
the impairment provisions were identified in connection with 
table of contents management s quarterly evaluation of the collectability of the company s portfolio assets and loans receivable 
the process for evaluating and measuring impairment is critical to our financial results  as it requires subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are uncertain 
this process also requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
it remains unclear what impact the illiquid markets  real estate value declines and the overall economic slowdown will ultimately have on our financial results 
these conditions could adversely impact our business if borrowers cannot refinance their loans and or continue to make payments which in turn could lead to rising loan defaults and foreclosures on loan collateral 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular period  we will not incur additional impairment provisions in the future 
foreign currency transaction gains the combined impact of foreign currency transactions from the company s consolidated and unconsolidated foreign operations resulted in a  foreign currency transaction gain in compared to a combined impact of a million foreign currency transaction loss in 
it remains unclear what impact that weakened global economic conditions will have on our financial holdings and investments from our european and latin american operations 
as such  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular period  we will not incur foreign currency transaction losses in the future 
management s outlook despite substantial losses reported in the financial services sector over the past two years and continued weaknesses in us and global economies and financial markets  management remains positive on the outlook of the company 
management believes that current market conditions should not hinder firstcity s ability to expand its business  and that distressed asset acquisition and middle market transaction opportunities at attractive prices and returns are available 
as mentioned above  firstcity s investment level increased to million in from million in comprising a million increase 
in addition  subsequent to december   the company has been involved in acquiring million of portfolio assets with a face value of approximately million of which firstcity s investment share was million and invested million in the form of debt and equity investments 
on and effective march   firstcity entered into amendments to its existing loan facilities with bank of scotland and bos usa collectively  bank of scotland that extended the maturity dates of the debt outstanding under these loan agreements to april  the credit amendments did not change the other primary terms and covenants of these loan facilities 
firstcity is very cognizant of the current terms of its primary credit facilities  as amended  with bank of scotland and the distressed condition of the us financial markets that currently presents challenges for businesses in accessing liquidity 
as such  firstcity and bank of scotland continue negotiations relating to a long term restructuring agreement that would  among other things  extend the maturity date of this debt beyond april  the company is in the process of negotiating a year term loan that allows for repayment to bank of scotland over time as cash flows from the underlying assets securing the loan facilities are realized 
it is anticipated that the term loan would allow the company to use its current liquidity and certain levels of cash flow to fund its overhead expenses and future investments 
firstcity will continue to actively pursue alternative funding sources with other parties to provide equity and or debt financing to support the company s future investment activities 
there can be no assurances that firstcity will close on a long term restructuring agreement with bank of scotland for its loan facilities on terms that are acceptable to the company  or that firstcity will be able to obtain alternative sources of funding on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents results of operations as a result of significant period to period fluctuations in our revenues and earnings  period to period comparisons of the results of our operations may not be meaningful

table of contents in privately held middle market companies  other investments  repayments of bank borrowings and other debt  and working capital to support our growth 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity have been funds generated from operations primarily loan collections and service fees  equity distributions from the acquisition partnerships and other subsidiaries  interest and principal payments on subordinated intercompany debt  dividends from the company s subsidiaries  borrowings from credit facilities with external lenders  and other special purpose short term borrowings 
cash generated from our operations and investments is dependent primarily upon our ability to collect on our consolidated portfolio assets and portfolio assets in our acquisition partnerships and loan investments 
many factors  including general economic conditions  are essential to our ability to generate cash flows 
fluctuations in our collections  investment income  credit availability  and adverse changes in other factors  could have a negative impact on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our business 
despite recent credit market conditions  we have continued to have access to liquidity in both our portfolio asset acquisition and resolution and special situations platform business segments through our credit facility commitments with our external lenders 
we believe that funds generated from collections from consolidated loan and real estate portfolios  loans receivable and other investments  fees generated from servicing assets  equity distributions from existing acquisition partnerships and other equity investments  and sales of guaranteed portions of existing and originated sba loans together with existing cash and available borrowings under our existing credit agreements will be sufficient to finance our current operations and support our growth during the next months

it is anticipated that the term loan would allow the company to use its current liquidity and certain levels of cash flow to fund its overhead expenses and future investments 
firstcity will continue to actively pursue alternative funding sources with other parties to provide equity and or debt financing to support the company s future investment activities

table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial position and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
loan portfolio assets revenue and impairment recognition a substantial majority of the company s portfolio assets include loans and loan portfolios with evidence of credit deterioration that were acquired after purchased credit impaired loans 
firstcity accounts for these loans under fasb s accounting guidance issued in december related to purchased credit impaired loans 
this guidance addresses accounting differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in acquired loans if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the guidance also requires acquired loans with credit deterioration to be initially recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of acquired loans that are within its scope 
the excess cash flows expected at acquisition over the loan portfolio s purchase price is recorded as interest income over the life of the portfolio 
the amounts paid for purchased credit impaired loans reflect the company s determination that the loans have experienced deterioration in credit quality since origination and that it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying loans 
at acquisition  the company reviews the individual loans to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  the company determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into static pools based on common risk characteristics primarily loan type and collateral 
static pools of individual loan accounts may be established and accounted for as a single economic unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static loan pool is established  individual accounts are generally not added to or removed from the pool unless the company sells  forecloses or writes off the loan 
at acquisition  the company determines the excess of the scheduled contractual payments over all cash flows expected to be collected for the loan or loan pool as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the cash flows from the loan or loan pool expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment accretable difference is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool on a level yield basis accretable yield 
the discount ie the difference between the cost of each loan or static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company does not expect to fully collect each contractual receivable balance for the loan or loan pool 
as a result  these loans and loan pools are recorded at cost which approximates fair value at the time of acquisition 
the company accounts for purchased credit impaired loans using either the interest method or a non accrual method through application of the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
application of the interest method is dependent on management s ability to develop a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
in the event the company cannot develop or establish a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of 
table of contents cash flows expected to be collected  the company uses the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
interest method of accounting 
under the interest method  an effective interest rate  or irr  is applied to the cost basis of the loan or loan pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows cannot be recognized as an adjustment of income or expense or on the balance sheet 
the irr that is calculated when the loan is purchased remains constant as the basis for subsequent impairment testing performed at least quarterly and income recognition 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows  are used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or loan pool  and any remaining increase may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing and income recognition 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the loan or loan pool to maintain the then current irr  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for loans and loan pools acquired with credit deterioration to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the cash flows expected at acquisition that are no longer expected to be collected 
income from loans and loan pools accounted for under the interest method is accrued based on the irr of each loan or loan pool applied to their respective adjusted cost basis 
gross collections in excess of the interest accrual and impairments will reduce the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  while gross collections less than the interest accrual will increase the carrying value 
the irr is calculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection models 
cost recovery method of accounting 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a loan are not reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the loan  or until such time as the company considers the timing and amount of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
at least quarterly  the company performs an evaluation to determine if the remaining amount that is probable of collection is less than the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  and if so  recognizes impairment through provisions charged to operations 
the cost recovery accounting model is permitted by fasb s accounting guidance applicable to purchased credit impaired loans 
cash basis method of accounting 
if only the amount of future cash collections on a loan is reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on an individual loan basis under the cash basis method of accounting 
under the cash basis method  no income is recognized unless collections are received during the period  or until such time as the company considers the timing of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
income is recognized for the difference between the collections and a pro rata portion of cost on a loan 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual collections divided by total projected collections on the loan 
significant increases in future cash flows may be recognized prospectively as income over the remaining life of the loan through increased amounts allocated to income when collections are subsequently received 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows will be recognized as impairment of the loan s cost basis to maintain a constant cost allocation based on initial projections 
the cash basis method accounting model is permitted by fasb s accounting guidance applicable to purchased credit impaired loans 

table of contents loans receivable valuation and impairment recognition loans receivable sba held for sale represent the portion of us small business administration sba loans acquired and originated by the company that are guaranteed by the sba 
these loans are recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value 
the fair value of sba loans held for sale is based primarily on what secondary markets are currently offering for loans with similar characteristics 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance through a charge to income 
the carrying value of sba loans held for sale is net of premiums as well as deferred origination fees and costs 
premiums and net origination fees and costs are deferred and included in the basis of the loans in calculating gains and losses upon sale 
sba loans are generally secured by the borrowing entities assets such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  and other business assets 
the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of each loan to a third party and retains the servicing rights 
the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the loans sold are recognized as net gains on sales of loans 
the non guaranteed portion of sba loans is generally classified as held for investment 
loans receivable consisting of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and other equity method investees and non affiliated entities  and the non guaranteed portion of sba loans  are classified by management as held for investment 
these loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income  charge offs  unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans  and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
loan origination fees and costs  as well as purchase premiums and discounts  are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms 
unamortized net fees  costs  premiums or discounts are recognized upon early repayment or sale of the loan 
repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral  and distributions made from affiliated entities 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
interest is recognized on an accrual basis at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding 
the company evaluates the need for impairment on loans receivable on an individual loan basis at least quarterly by reviewing the collectibility of the loans in light of various factors  as applicable  such as estimated future cash receipts of the borrower or underlying collateral  historical experience  estimated value of underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and industry concentrations 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms including scheduled interest payments 
when management identifies a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment based on discounted future cash flows  except when the source of repayment is the operation or liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the company generally ceases to accrue interest on the note and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income to the extent deemed by management to be uncollectible 
when ultimate collectibility of the impaired note is in doubt  all collections are generally applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered  and collections thereafter are recognized as interest income 
impairment losses are charged against an allowance account through provisions charged to operations in the period impairment is identified 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
deferred tax assets valuation the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
table of contents assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically by the company based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other factors  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  the company s experience with utilizing available operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
for purposes of evaluating the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december  and  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets due to the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
regardless of the deferred tax valuation allowance established at december   the company continues to retain net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the year includes million of net operating loss carryforwards that expire in 
to the extent that the company generates taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets  subject to certain potential limitations  it may be able to reduce its effective tax rate by reducing the valuation allowance 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates could have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
estimates of cash receipts on portfolio assets the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from portfolio assets are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of certain non performing portfolios assets  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios assets  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in our portfolio assets 
the company uses proprietary programs and collection models to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset  the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash 
table of contents receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
consolidation policy the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of firstcity  its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries  and certain variable interest entities 
if we determine that we have a controlling financial interest in an entity  then we must consolidate the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the entity in our consolidated financial statements 
a controlling financial interest typically arises as a result of ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity 
we may also have a controlling financial interest in an entity through an arrangement that does not involve voting interests  such as a variable interest entity vie 
in general  a vie is an entity that has one or more of the following characteristics the entity has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities  the group of equity owners does not have the ability to make significant decisions about the entity s activities  the group of equity owners does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns generated by its operations  or both  or the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity  or both  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
if any of these characteristics is present  the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation analysis  and consolidation is based on variable interests  and not solely on ownership of the entity s outstanding voting stock 
variable interests are generally defined as contractual  ownership or other economic interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
the company consolidates any vie of which it is the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs a majority of expected losses or receives a majority of residual returns if the losses or returns occur  or both 
we are required to evaluate whether to consolidate a vie when we first become involved and upon subsequent reconsideration events eg  a purchase of additional equity interests 
generally  if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  then we initially record the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the company does not consolidate equity investments in to owned entities that are not vies where the company does not have an effective controlling interest  or equity investments in to owned entities that are vies where the company is not the primary beneficiary 
rather  such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies 
the company also accounts for its unconsolidated equity investments in less than owned entities under the equity method of accounting 
firstcity has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these entities  despite its comparatively smaller ownership percentage  due primarily to its active participation in the policy making process as well as its involvement in the daily management activities 
these entities are formed generally to share in the risks and rewards in developing new markets as well as to pool resources 
under the equity method of accounting  the company s investment in these unconsolidated entities is carried at the cost of acquisition  plus the company s share of equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
effects of newly adopted accounting standards business combinations and noncontrolling interests in december  the fasb issued accounting and reporting guidance on business combinations in consolidated financial statements 
the guidance on business combinations establishes principal requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 

table of contents this guidance also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination  recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
we adopted this new guidance on january  and prospectively applied this guidance to business combinations completed on or after january  in april  the fasb issued guidance that amends the accounting requirements for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance amends the applicable business combination accounting guidance that the fasb issued in december this amended guidance requires that pre acquisition contingencies be recognized at fair value  if fair value can be reasonably determined 
if fair value cannot be reasonably determined  the guidance requires measurement based on the best estimate in accordance with contingency accounting guidance 
we adopted this guidance on january  in connection with the adoption of the fasb s business combination guidance issued in december as discussed above 
in december  the fasb issued accounting and reporting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance defines noncontrolling interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to the parent 
the new guidance requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent previously referred to as minority interest to be clearly presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to any noncontrolling interest must be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest greater than percent ownership are to be accounted for as equity transactions with no remeasurement to fair value 
upon a loss of control  any gain or loss on the interest sold will be recognized in earnings 
additionally  any ownership interest retained will be re measured at fair value on the date control is lost  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
the new guidance also requires companies to report a consolidated net income loss measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling interests 
we adopted this guidance on january  and prospectively applied this guidance to all noncontrolling interests including those that arose prior to the adoption 
however  as required  the presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance were applied retrospectively for all periods presented and impacted our consolidated financial statements as follows noncontrolling interests of million were reclassified from total liabilities to equity as of december  in our consolidated balance sheet and statement of stockholders equity  noncontrolling interests of million were reclassified from total liabilities to equity as of december  in our consolidated statement of stockholders equity  and net contributions from noncontrolling interests of million were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  fair value in  the fasb issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements that provides a common definition of fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
in february  the fasb issued additional guidance that deferred the effective date of the original guidance for one year for certain non financial assets and liabilities  and removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of the original guidance 
we adopted this new guidance for financial assets 
table of contents and liabilities on january   and for non financial assets and liabilities on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance that provides additional application guidance regarding fair value measurements 
this guidance relates to determining fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
this new guidance reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive 
we adopted this guidance effective april  the adoption of the provisions of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance that establishes enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements
