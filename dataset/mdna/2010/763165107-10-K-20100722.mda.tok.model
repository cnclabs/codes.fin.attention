during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our rfpd and edg segments were fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of these segments exceeded their fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our rfpd and edg segments exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the february  measurement date 
as a result  we recorded pre tax goodwill impairment charges of million and million for rfpd and edg  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  a million tax benefit was recorded related to the goodwill impairment

on february   we sold our building in pianopoli  italy  for million and recorded a pre tax gain of million during the third quarter of fiscal other income expense other income expense was an expense of million during fiscal  compared with an expense of million during fiscal the increase in expense during fiscal was due primarily to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and a loss related to the redemption of a portion of our long term debt  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense 
other income expense included a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal  as compared to a foreign exchange gain of million during fiscal our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of our us currency we have in non us bank accounts

income tax provision the effective income tax rates during fiscal   and were   and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory rate of during fiscal and during fiscal and  primarily results from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses  release of valuation allowances related to net operating losses  and repatriation of foreign earnings 
also  fiscal includes a million tax benefit related to prior year s income taxes of certain foreign jurisdications 
as of may   domestic federal net operating loss nol carryforwards amounted to approximately million 
these federal nols expire between and domestic state nol carryforwards amounted to approximately million 
these state nols expire between and foreign nol carryforwards totaled approximately million with various or indefinite expiration dates 
we also have an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of may  in the amount of million that has an indefinite carryforward period 
income taxes paid  including foreign estimated tax payments  were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
as of may   all of the cumulative positive earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which amounted to million  are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to asc  income taxes other considerations or special areas asc 
due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing  it is not possible to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we are no longer subject to either us federal  state  or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal we are no longer subject to non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are china  japan  germany  singapore  and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in singapore beginning in fiscal  in japan beginning in fiscal  in the netherlands and germany beginning in fiscal  and in china beginning in calendar year effective june   we adopted the provisions of asc  income taxes asc  related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken 
table of contents in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of asc would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of a valuation allowance against net operating losses 
as of the date of adoption  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
the uncertain tax positions as of may   and may   totaled million and million  respectively 
unrecognized tax benefits of million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits in thousands may  may  unrecognized tax benefits  beginning of period decrease due to currency translation increase in positions taken in prior period decrease in positions taken in prior period increase in positions taken in current period decrease related to the expiration of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits  end of period we record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
as of may  and may   we recorded a liability for interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
it is reasonably possible that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest and penalties  in the range of to approximately million due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next months 
discontinued operations on may   we completed the sale of the security systems division burtek systems ssd burtek to honeywell international incorporated honeywell 
the sale agreement of ssd burtek to honeywell contemplated a post closing working capital based purchase price adjustment 
on december   we reached an agreement with honeywell to settle the pending working capital disputes as well as other related claims 
as a result  we recorded million of expense  net of zero tax effect  as a loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  a cash settlement of million was paid

during the first quarter of fiscal  we mutually agreed with honeywell that honeywell would not purchase the ssd burtek colombia business  and that we would wind down the ssd burtek colombia business 

table of contents liquidity  financial position  and capital resources we have financed our growth and cash needs largely through income from operations  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes  and the sale of assets 
liquidity is reduced by working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures  dividends  and business acquisitions 
liquidity is increased by proceeds from borrowings  disposition of businesses and assets  and improved working capital management 
cash and cash equivalents were million at may   as compared to million at may  cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  due primarily to lower inventory balances and higher accounts payable  partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances 
the decline in inventory balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million and inventory provisions of million  during fiscal  was due primarily to increased sales volume and higher inventory turns 
the increase in accounts payable balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  during fiscal  was due primarily to the timing of payments 
the increase in accounts receivable balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange of million during fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  due primarily to lower accounts receivable and inventory balances  partially offset by lower accounts payables and accrued liabilities balances 
the decline in accounts receivables of million  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange of million  during fiscal was due primarily to a decline in sales volume and increased collection efforts 
the decline in inventory balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million and inventory write downs of million  during fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in purchases due to the decline in sales volume 
the decline in accounts payable balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  during fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in purchases of inventory 
the decline in accrued liabilities balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  during fiscal reflects the timing and payment of accrued payroll 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal  was due primarily to capital expenditures of million for information technology projects and building improvements  and million for the cash settlement related to ssd burtek 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was due primarily to capital expenditures of million for information technology projects and building improvements  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  are summarized in the following table in thousands may  may  proceeds from the exercise of stock options stock repurchase cash dividends paid retirement of long term debt other cash used in financing activities on january   we repurchased  shares of our common stock held in our employee stock ownership plan esop in a private transaction at an average price of  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the esop was terminated on october  annual dividend payments for both fiscal and fiscal were approximately million 
all future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend payments will depend on earnings  capital requirements  operating conditions  and such other factors that the board may deem relevant 
our board of directors paid a quarterly dividend of per common share and per class b common share during fiscal and as of may   we maintained million in short term debt in the form of convertible senior subordinated notes notes 
we reclassified million of long term debt to short term debt for fiscal due to the redemption on june   of the remaining balance of our notes 
see note subsequent events of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional discussion on the redemption 
the decrease in long term debt during fiscal was due to our redemption of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes notes on january  as well as million  million  million  and million on december   march   april   and may   respectively  of our notes 
we believe that the existing sources of liquidity  including cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our revolving credit agreement  will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending may  contractual obligations as a smaller reporting company  this information is not required 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the significant estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  goodwill impairment testing  income taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of may  and may   respectively 
impairment of investments we hold a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assess its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and our cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
we recognized investment impairment charges of less than million during fiscal we did not recognize any investment impairment charges during fiscal and revenue recognition our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment  when title passes to the customer  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
our sales are recorded net of discounts and returns based on our historical experience 
our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications 
our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs 
our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell 
although we have multiple deliverables in limited circumstances that meet the requirements under asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  in every instance where we do have multiple deliverables  the predominant deliverable in the arrangement is always the product sold 
therefore  under the guidance of asc  we apply the revenue recognition criteria associated with the predominant item  or product sold 
inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
inventories include material  labor  and overhead costs associated with such inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods held for sale 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges  obsolescence  the exiting of certain market segments  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 

table of contents we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 
goodwill and intangible assets as of may   we had fully impaired all of our goodwill related to each of our segments 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under asc if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill 
our goodwill impairment testing follows the two step process as defined in asc the first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the end of our third quarter as the measurement date 
in reviewing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
we assess in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its net realizable value 
the impairment charge is recorded in operating results 
the results of our impairment tests for fiscal and indicated no impairment of our long lived assets 
warranties we offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture 
we also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
our warranty terms generally range from one to three years 
we estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
we record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
each quarter  we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product by product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation 
with respect to new products  estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products  the extended warranty period  and warranty experience 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other available evidence

stock compensation effective june   we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options 
we estimate fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life  and dividends 
compensation cost is recognized using a graded vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period  or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved  if shorter non substantive vesting period approach 
see note significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for further information 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence 
these factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we  or any of our affiliates  have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards 
in evaluating the positive evidence available  expectations as to future taxable income would rarely be sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of recent cumulative losses  even if supported by detailed forecasts and projections 
as of may   and may   our deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards was million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for a period not greater than years 
we recorded valuation allowances for substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards  and tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
effective june   we adopted the provisions of asc  income taxes asc  related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of asc would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of a valuation allowance against net operating losses 
as of the date of adoption  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits
