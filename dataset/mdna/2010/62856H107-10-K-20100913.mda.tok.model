item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with selected financial data  and the financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
information regarding these forward looking statements can be found in the preface to part i  item business of this form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel treatments for cancer 
our development pipeline includes clinical and pre clinical product candidates with distinct mechanisms of action and novel chemical structures that have the potential to be first in class and or best in class therapeutics 
the discovery and development of each of our drug candidates has been guided by a unique understanding of the genetic causes of human diseases  and the genetic factors that may cause drug side effects  drug interactions  and drug metabolism 
our extensive experience in human genetics  protein protein interaction technology and chemical proteomic drug discovery has allowed identification of novel drug targets and accelerated progression from chemical lead compounds to investigational drug candidates 
we were incorporated as myriad pharmaceuticals  inc in delaware in january as a new  wholly owned subsidiary of myriad genetics  inc in order to effect the separation and spin off of myriad genetics research and drug development businesses as a stand alone  independent  publicly traded company 
in connection with the formation of this new subsidiary  myriad genetics existing subsidiary  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc  changed its corporate name to myriad therapeutics  inc  and we adopted the name of myriad pharmaceuticals  inc which was subsequently changed to myrexis  inc 
effective july  on june   myriad genetics contributed substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its research and drug development businesses as well as million in cash and marketable securities to us and effected the spin off of our company through a pro rata dividend distribution to its stockholders of all outstanding shares of our common stock 
we operate in one reportable operating segment that includes research and drug development 
until the fiscal year ended june   our revenues consisted primarily of research payments related to research collaboration agreements 
in fiscal  our revenue included a million non refundable fee received from h 
lundbeck a s  or lundbeck  in connection with an agreement granting lundbeck european commercialization rights to flurizan  our former drug candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
during the year ended june   we reported  in revenues associated with collaborative external agreements and a net loss of million 
we expect to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future and that such losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in preparation for the commercialization of our drug candidates and some of these expenses will be incurred prior to fda approval  which approval is not assured 
our drug research and development expenses include costs incurred for our current clinical stage drug candidates  azixa and mpc  our most advanced preclinical stage drug candidate  mpc  as well as our discontinued drug candidates mpc  mpc  and flurizan 
currently  the only costs we track by each drug candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by clinical research organizations  manufacturing of drug supply  and other outsourced research 
we do not assign or allocate internal costs such as salaries and benefits  facilities costs  lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies to individual development programs 
we also incurred costs related to external research collaborations from our research services business 
we track all underlying principal costs associated with our research collaborations 
all development costs for our drug candidates and external research collaborations are expensed as incurred 
our 
table of contents research and development expense for each of our current clinical stage programs  azixa and mpc  our most advanced preclinical stage drug candidate  mpc  as well as our discontinued drug candidates mpc  mpc  and flurizan during the fiscal years ended june   and are as follows years ended june  in thousands external costs  drug candidates azixa mpc mpc mpc mpc flurizan sub total direct costs internal costs  drug candidates preclinical development costs external research collaborations total research and development the timing and amount of any future expenses  completion dates  and revenues for our drug candidates is not readily determinable due to the early stage of these development programs 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
while expenses associated with the completion of our current clinical programs are expected to be substantial and increase  we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including the scope  rate of progress  and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials  the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  our ability to market  commercialize  manufacture and supply  and achieve market acceptance for our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  and the filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcement of any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment of patients in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  income taxes  clinical trial expenses  and share based payment expense 
revenue recognition revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period or upon termination of a development or license agreement when we have no ongoing obligation 
research revenue includes revenue from research services agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of revenue recognition to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  as underlying research costs are incurred  or on the basis of contractually defined output measures such as units delivered 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheets 
revenue from milestone payments for which we have no continuing performance obligations is recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
when we have continuing performance obligations  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
we recognize revenue from upfront nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
income taxes our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
those factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential uncertain tax positions  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated 
table of contents valuation allowance we deem necessary to offset deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary to fully offset our deferred tax assets 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our uncertain income tax positions in our consolidate financial statements  adverse determination by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and penalties on income tax items are included as a component of overall income tax expense 
clinical trial expenses the cost of our clinical trials is based  in part  on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations  or the cros 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of our drug candidates 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract  are subject to negotiation and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  we recognize direct expenses related to each patient enrolled in a clinical trial on an estimated cost per patient basis as services are performed 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from cros  such as estimated costs per patient  to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial  which we would confirm directly with the cro 
if our cros were to either under or over report the costs that they have incurred or if there is a change in the estimated per patient costs  it could have an impact on our clinical trial expenses during the period in which they report a change in estimated costs to us 
adjustments to our clinical trial accruals primarily relate to indirect costs  for which we place significant reliance on our cros for accurate information at the end of each reporting period 
share based payment expense share based compensation expense standards set accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and require us to recognize  as expense  in our statements of operations  the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the terms of each grant  the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
in connection with the separation and spin off from myriad genetics and related transactions  each outstanding myriad genetics stock option was converted into an adjusted myriad genetics common stock option  exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock as the original myriad genetics option  and a new myrexis common stock option  exercisable for one fourth of the number of shares of common stock as the original myriad genetics option 
an adjusted exercise price of each converted option was determined in accordance with section a and section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
all other terms of the converted options remain the same however  the vesting and expiration of the converted options will be based on the optionholder s continuing employment with myriad genetics or myrexis  as applicable  following the separation 

table of contents as a result of the option modifications that occurred in connection with the separation from myriad genetics  myriad genetics measured the potential accounting impact of these option modifications 
based upon the analysis  which included a comparison of the fair value of the modified options granted to our employees and directors immediately after the modification with the fair value of the original option immediately prior to the modification  it was determined that there was no incremental compensation expense 
all unrecognized compensation expense at june  that is related to myriad genetics options and myrexis options that are held by current myrexis employees and directors will be recognized by us over the remaining vesting term of the option 
all such expense relating to myrexis options held by current and former myriad genetics employees  directors or consultants will not be recognized by us 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update  or asu   improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of levels and and a higher level of disaggregation for the different types of financial instruments 
for the reconciliation of level fair value measurements  information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements are presented separately 
this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  with the exception of revised level disclosure requirements which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  comparative disclosures are not required in the year of adoption 
we adopted the provisions of the standard on january   and the necessary disclosures are reflected in note to the financial statements 
results of operations the balance sheets as of june  and  and notes related thereto reflect the balances of myrexis as an independent company 
for all periods prior to june   amounts reflected in the results of operations are components of myriad genetics that constituted the research and drug development businesses that were separated 
those financial statements have been prepared using myriad genetics historical costs basis of the assets and liabilities of the various activities that reflect the combined results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of us as a component of myriad genetics 
specific costs attributable to our operations have been included in the financial statements 
the financial statements also include some proportional cost allocations of certain common costs of myriad genetics because these expenses were not specifically identified at the subsidiary level 
the basis of these allocations includes full time equivalent employees for the respective periods presented  square footage  and other appropriate allocation drivers 
the financial information for the year ended june  reflects the financial position  results of operations and cash flows for myrexis as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for the years ended june  and in the financial statements reflects allocations for services historically provided to us by myriad genetics and does not include all of the expenses that would have been incurred had we been a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity  including  but not limited to  costs to implement accounting  human resource  payroll  purchasing  information technology  legal and other business functions and systems 
years ended june  and research revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to external collaborative agreements 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in research revenue was primarily attributable to a genomic sequencing research collaboration and a long term contract that were completed during the fiscal year 
the company anticipates research revenue to trend similar to fiscal in the future 

table of contents research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  equipments costs  facilities expense  and costs associated with our clinical trials 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased internal preclinical developments costs of approximately million resulting from reduction in headcount and other internal development activities related to our former drug candidate flurizan  decreased external drug candidate costs associated with our hiv drug candidate of million due to the purchase of in process research and development related to mpc and further development of this drug candidate  and decreased external drug candidate costs associated with the discontinuation of mpc of million 
we expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate over the next several years as we conduct additional clinical trials to support the potential commercialization of our drug candidates currently in clinical development  including azixa and mpc  and advance other drug candidates into clinical development 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for marketing  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million  compared to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of was due primarily to an increase in expenses associated with being a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity  including  but not limited to  costs to implement accounting  human resource  payroll  purchasing  information technology  legal and other business functions and systems 
in addition to these certain costs  we incurred million in external acquisition expenses in connection with the proposed merger with javelin pharmaceuticals  inc that was terminated in april these expenses were offset by million in stipulated expenses reimbursed by javelin plus a termination fee of million 
these reimbursed expenses are presented in the financials for the year ended june   as an offset to total selling  general and administrative costs 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
other income expense for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to a for the fiscal year ended june  other income reflects interest income and realized gains on our marketable securities offset by a loss on disposal of assets 
prior to june   all cash and investments were held and managed by myriad genetics and  as a result  we recognized no interest income in our financial statements 
years ended june  and research and other revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to external collaborative agreements 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in research revenue was primarily attributable to the completion of genomic sequencing research collaboration in september research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and outputs increase or decrease  revenue may increase or decrease proportionately 
pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of co marketing agreement payments received relating to our former drug candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  flurizan 
on may   we entered into an agreement with lundbeck for european commercialization of flurizan 
as consideration for entering into the agreement we received a million non refundable upfront fee which we expected to recognize over years 
on june   we announced the results of our us month phase clinical trial of flurizan in patients with mild alzheimer s disease 
the trial did not achieve statistical significance on either of its primary 
table of contents endpoints  cognition and activities of daily living 
as a result we discontinued all ongoing flurizan clinical studies in  including the decision to discontinue our global phase trial  and have no further performance obligations under the agreement 
the discontinuance of the flurizan development program and any ongoing development activity related to flurizan resulted in the recognition of the full million upfront fee as pharmaceutical revenue in fiscal in the fiscal year ended june   we recognized million in pharmaceutical and other revenues relating to payments received under the agreement with lundbeck 
we had no pharmaceutical or other revenue in fiscal research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  equipments costs  facilities expense  and costs associated with our clinical trials 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased external drug development costs of approximately million resulting from the discontinuance of our former drug candidate flurizan that includes a million credit  recorded in fiscal  resulting from the difference in an estimated sublicense fee accrual recorded in fiscal and amounts actually paid in  increased external drug development costs associated with our hiv drug candidates of million due to the purchase of in process research and development related to mpc and further development of this drug candidate  which was offset by a million decrease in expenditures relating to mpc  increased external drug development costs of approximately million and million for mpc and azixa  respectively  our oncology drug candidates currently in clinical development  and a decrease of approximately million due to the completion of external research collaborations 
we expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate over the next several years as we conduct additional clinical trials to support the potential commercialization of our drug candidates currently in clinical development  including azixa  mpc  and advance other drug candidates into clinical development 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for marketing  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million  compared to million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of was due primarily to a decrease in commercialization efforts and internal expense allocations resulting from the discontinuance of our drug candidate flurizan 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
we had no other income expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to a million net expense for the fiscal year ended june  this change was primarily attributable to the write off of million of our preferred stock investment in encore pharmaceuticals  inc from whom we had previously licensed flurizan in as a result of our discontinuation of our drug candidate flurizan 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used by operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
the change in cash flow from operating activity can be attributed primarily to the higher net loss in fiscal and the payment of accrued expenses associated with the our former drug candidate flurizan 
these were offset  in part  by higher non cash charges associated with share based compensation and the write off of purchased in process research and development recorded in fiscal 
table of contents our investing activities used million in cash during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the change is primarily due to the purchase  net of maturities and selling of our marketable investment securities 
in addition  we invested million in capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended june  in leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment for the new facility that we took occupancy of in january we anticipate our investment in additional equipment and leasehold improvements will be minimal in the future 
approximately million in cash was provided by financing activities during fiscal  compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
financing activities in fiscal were comprised primarily of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock awards 
the change from fiscal to is primarily attributed to the cash and myriad genetics net investment in myrexis both of which were contributed to capital in connection with the spin off in fiscal prior to june   all cash and investments were held and managed by myriad genetics 
accordingly  cash used to pay our expenses or cash collected from collaboration agreements was provided or received by myriad genetics on our behalf and were recorded as an increase or decrease in the myriad genetics net investment capital deficiency 
as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of june  we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations through at least june   although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including progress in and results from our clinical trials of azixa and mpc  failure or delays in advancing our preclinical drug candidates  including mpc  or other drug candidates we may develop in the future  into clinical trials  results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our drug candidates  issues in manufacturing our drug candidates or approved products  regulatory developments or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries  developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  if any cover our common stock  failure to secure adequate capital to fund our operations if and when needed  or the issuance of equity securities at prices below the current market price  public concern over our drug candidates or any approved products  litigation  future sales of our common stock  general market conditions  changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  failure of any of our drug candidates  if approved  to achieve commercial success  economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises  period to period fluctuations in our financial results  and overall fluctuations in us equity markets 

table of contents we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval that have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total less than one year years years more than years contractual services lease obligations total contractual services represent financial commitments for drug development and clinical trial activities that can be terminated at our request 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on currently available information 
the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ depending on the timing of goods or services received and other factors 
the table above only includes payment obligations that are fixed or determinable 
the table excludes potential milestone payments we may be required to pay under license agreements in the aggregate of up to million based on the progress of our drug candidates currently in development  as the likelihood and timing of such payments is not yet determinable 
the table also excludes royalties payable to third parties based on future sales of any of our drug candidates that may be approved for sale in the future  as the amount  timing  and likelihood of any such payments are unknown 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  revenues  or operating results during the periods presented 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities which are subject to interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of highly liquid securities of various types and maturities of two years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of these marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june  and  we have determined  hypothetically  that in the event of an increase of basis points in a key market interest rate  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would not have a material effect on our financial condition or on our financial statements as a whole
