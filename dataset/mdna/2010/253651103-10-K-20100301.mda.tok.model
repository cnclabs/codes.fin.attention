inventories the company primarily values inventories at the lower of cost or market applied on a first in  first out fifo basis  with the notable exception of brazil that values inventories using the average cost method  which approximates fifo 
at each reporting period  the company identifies and writes down its excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value based on forecasted usage  orders and inventory aging 
with the development of new products  the company also rationalizes its product offerings and will write down discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
goodwill goodwill is the cost in excess of the net assets of acquired businesses 
the company tests all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment using the fair value approach on a reporting unit basis in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the company s reporting units are defined as domestic and canada  brazil  latin america  asia pacific  and emea 
the company uses the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method for determining the fair value of its reporting units 
as required by asc  the determination of implied fair value of the goodwill for a particular reporting unit is the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities in the same manner as the allocation in a business combination 
implied fair value goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
the company uses the most current information available and performs the annual impairment analysis as of november each year 
however  actual circumstances could differ significantly from assumptions and estimates made and could result in future goodwill impairment 
the company tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of a reporting unit below its reported amount 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment based on a two step test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value 
the fair value is determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows as well as the market approach or guideline public company method 
the company s step i impairment test of goodwill of a reporting unit is based upon the fair value of the reporting unit  defined as the price that would be received to sell the net assets or transfer the net liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the assessment date november 
in the event that the net carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a step ii test must be performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be estimated to determine if it is less than its net carrying amount 
the valuation techniques used in the step i impairment test have incorporated a number of assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable and to reflect forecasted market conditions at the assessment date 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment 
the company makes all efforts to forecast future cash flows as accurately as 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  continued unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts possible with the information available at the time a forecast is made 
to this end  the company evaluates the appropriateness of its assumptions as well as its overall forecasts by comparing projected results of upcoming years with actual results of preceding years and validating that differences therein are reasonable 
key assumptions relate to price trends  material costs  discount rate  customer demand  and the long term growth and foreign exchange rates 
a number of benchmarks from independent industry and other economic publications were also used 
changes in assumptions and estimates after the assessment date may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods 
specifically  actual results may vary from the company s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable  thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions 
the annual goodwill impairment test for  and resulted in no impairment related to income from continuing operations 
however  the valuation techniques used in the impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change  although the company believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect forecasted market conditions at the assessment date 
any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise  may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods 
in particular  the carrying amount of goodwill in the company s brazil reporting unit was  as of december   with limited excess fair value over such carrying amount refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
because actual results may vary from our forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable  the company may need to record future impairment charges with respect to the goodwill attributed to the brazil reporting unit or other reporting units 
taxes on income in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes asc  deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences

deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various us  federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
additionally  the company has retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses 
the company s income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions  as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  the company s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
the company regularly assesses its position with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of asc the company has recorded an accrual that reflects the recognition and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return based upon asc additional future income tax expense or benefit may be recognized once the positions are effectively settled 
at the end of each interim reporting period  the company estimates the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned  as well as tax planning strategies 
current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions may result in an increasing effective tax rate over time 
if the actual results differ from estimates  the company may adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period if such determination is made

the sensitivity model assumes an instantaneous  parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates
