overview we a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and high reliability semiconductors 
our semiconductors manage and control or regulate power  protect against transient voltage spikes and transmit  receive and amplify signals 
our products include individual components as well as integrated circuit solutions that enhance customer designs by improving performance  reliability and battery optimization  reducing size or protecting circuits 
the principal end markets that we serve include security defense  aerospace  enterprise commercial and industrial alternative energy 
our integrated circuits ic products offer light  sound and power management for desktop and mobile computing platforms  lcd tvs and other power control applications 
power management generally refers to a class of standard linear integrated circuits slics that perform voltage regulation and reference in most electronic systems 
the definition of power management has broadened in recent years to encompass other devices and modules  often application specific standard products assps  which address particular aspects of power management  such as audio or display related ics 
this business is composed of both a core platform of traditional slics  such as low dropout regulators ldos and pulse width modulators pwms  and differentiated assps such as backlight inverters  audio amplification ics and small computer standard interface terminators

microsemi has implemented a growth strategy through continuous innovation complemented by strategic acquisitions with the intent of increasing our technology footprint in customers end designs 
this allows us to offer an increased value proposition  gather a larger portion of the bill of materials  and engage with customers as a strategic partner as opposed to a socket provider 
we believe this strategy strengthens microsemi s position in the industry as it protects and grows our share within those markets with the highest barriers to entry 
recent industry leading innovations include precision target seeking and secure guidance solutions resulting in substantial improvements in size  accuracy  and cost efficient weaponry  
table of contents microwave technology that gives defense and commercial radar systems the horsepower to operate over distances of miles and more  leading edge wireless and wired network solutions for n wi fi and poe technology  millimeter wave rf devices and systems that ensure fast and safe full body security screening and higher resolution mri systems  led driver products that enable better image quality and power savings in the latest big screen lcd tvs and more efficient lighting solutions for solid state lighting  power ics and devices enabling substantial panel and battery efficiency gains for solar electric systems and hybrid powered vehicles  and breakthrough plastic packaging technology for transient voltage suppression devices 
our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new technologies and products  and complemented by our ability to implement our selective acquisitions strategy 
new technologies or products that we may develop may not lead to an incremental increase in revenues  and there is a risk that these new technologies or products will decrease the demand for our existing products and result in an offsetting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that the benefits of any acquisitions will outweigh the attendant costs  and if they do not  our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected 
net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for net sales decreased million or between and from million for between and  increases in net sales were driven by growth in our security defense and enterprise commercial end markets 
the growth in the security defense end market was attributable to products we added from the acquisition of white electronic designs corporation and the ramping of millimeter wave scan subsystem and military radar applications 
enterprise commercial net sales rebounded in with increases in both enterprise and consumer demand 
enterprise demand particularly supported sales of our poe products and our market share in backlighting products continued to increase at tier suppliers and tier original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms 
between and  while net sales in our security defense and aerospace markets grew  our enterprise commercial and industrial alternative energy end markets declined 
these two end markets were particularly impacted by difficult economic conditions which reduced capital spending by companies and discretionary spending by consumers 
on november   we announced that we expect that our consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year  including contributions from our recently announced acquisition of actel corporation  will increase between to percent  sequentially 
recent negative worldwide economic conditions and market instability have made it increasingly difficult for us  our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends 
if signs of improvement in the global economy do not progress as expected and the global economic conditions slowdown continues or worsens  our forecasts of product demand trends could prove to be incorrect and could cause us to produce excess products that can depress product prices  increase our inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory 
alternatively  this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products  or materials used in our products  that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share 
operating income increased million between and to million from an operating loss of million for operating income decreased million between and from million in operating income in benefited from increased net sales  which have surpassed levels and from restructuring and cost control measures 
operating income in was impacted by a decline in net sales and charges incurred in restructuring our operations 

table of contents we expect that future improvements in operating income will occur upon the successful consolidation of our scottsdale facility and continued focus on cost controls 
the consolidation of scottsdale is expected to result  subsequent to its completion  in annualized cost savings of approximately million from the elimination of redundant resources and related expenses and employee reductions 
however  we face major technical challenges in regard to transferring component manufacturing between locations 
before a transfer of manufacturing  we must be finished qualifying the new facility appropriately with the us government or certain customers 
while we plan generally to retain all of the revenues and income of those operations by transferring the manufacturing elsewhere within microsemi s subsidiaries  our plans may change at any time based on reassessment of the alternatives and consequences 
while we hope to benefit overall from increased gross margins and increased capacity utilization rates at remaining operations  the remaining operations will need to bear the corporate administrative and overhead costs  which are charges to income that had been allocated to the discontinued business units 
moreover  delays in effecting our consolidations could result in greater than anticipated costs incurred to achieve the anticipated longer range savings

table of contents during the year ended october   we have actively taken steps to integrate the management of our various operations  including management of our recent acquisitions 
production has been transferred among our facilities to share resources and technology  as well as to increase efficiency 
we strive to make the best possible use of our engineering capabilities by sharing research and production methods across our divisions and  where appropriate  assigning engineers to the same projects  regardless of the facility that incurs the personnel expense 
our manufacturing management team has also been reorganized to increase efficiency 
restructuring and severance charges in  we announced consolidation plans for our facility in broomfield  colorado broomfield 
broomfield ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of substantially all accrued severance amounts related to broomfield have been paid 
in  we approved consolidation plans that will result in the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona scottsdale  with production activities expected to cease in february scottsdale currently has approximately employees and occupies a  square foot leased facility 
shipments from the scottsdale facility accounted for approximately of net sales for the fiscal year ended october  at september   we had recorded severance accruals of  that are expected to be paid through the following table reflects the restructuring activities for the scottsdale facility and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance other associated costs balance at september  provisions cash expenditures balance at october  at september   we had recorded severance accruals of  from reductions in force at our various facilities other than broomfield and scottsdale 
we recorded additional severance accruals related to provisions totaling  during the fiscal year ended october  these restructuring activities covered approximately individuals in manufacturing  engineering and sales 
substantially all accrued amounts are expected to be paid within twelve months 
the following table reflects the restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance balance at september  provisions cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at october  acquisitions and divestiture we have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies  additional product lines and assets 
we currently expect to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
in the first quarter of  we acquired substantially all the assets of microwave device technology corporation and all the common stock of tsi microelectronics corporation for million in cash  net of cash 
table of contents acquired 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired substantially all the assets of semicoa for million  including million in cash consideration to semicoa and certain creditors  the assumption of million in liabilities  million related to a lease agreement with a party related to semicoa shareholders and million in transaction fees and expenses 
we funded these acquisitions with cash on hand 
during  we entered into a stock purchase agreement in which we acquired all the shares of electro module  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  babcock  inc for million  net of cash acquired 
babcock  inc is a leading manufacturer of high reliability power supplies  relays and flat panel displays and supplies 
we subsequently renamed babcock  inc  microsemi corp 
power management group pmg 
also during  we entered into an asset purchase agreement in which we acquired substantially all the assets of the defense and security business of endwave corporation for million 
this business designs  manufactures and markets radio frequency modules that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency signals 
markets for these products include defense electronics  homeland security systems and other applications that require high frequency radio frequency circuitry and subsystems 
we subsequently renamed the defense and security business of endwave corporation  microsemi corp 
rf integrated solutions 
our final acquisition of  was of nexsem  inc in which we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of its assets for million 
nexsem  inc is a designer and marketer of high voltage dc to dc conversion devices for applications such as in lcd televisions  set top boxes  notebooks and netbooks 
this acquisition was integrated into the existing operations of microsemi corp 
analog mixed signal group 
in the fourth quarter of and in connection with a settlement with the united states department of justice  we entered into an agreement that  in substance  resulted in the divestiture of the assets purchased from semicoa 
proceeds from this transaction totaled million  of which million was deposited with an escrow agent to be released one year subsequent to the transaction date 
we sold accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangible assets with net book values of million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we reduced goodwill by million based on the proceeds received relative to microsemi s total market capitalization on the transaction date 
direct transaction expenses related to the sale amounted to million 
during  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of white electronic designs corporation white electronic  a defense electronics manufacturer and supplier that designs  develops and manufactures innovative electronic components and systems for inclusion in high technology products for the defense and aerospace markets  for a net million in cash 
we also acquired substantially all the assets of vt silicon  a designer and manufacturer of multi band radio frequency integrated circuit rfic solutions for the mobile wireless broadband market and all the shares of arxan defense systems  inc  a leading provider of anti tamper solutions  providing full service support to defense clients in securing systems against tampering  piracy and reverse engineering 
in the aggregate  acquisitions in met the minimum thresholds for reporting historical results on a pro forma basis 
historical results on a pro forma basis and additional disclosures related to our acquisitions are included in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amount shown in the balance sheet are trade accounts receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition including manufacturing plant closures 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets within the asset group over their fair value is recorded 
the appropriate asset group is determined based on the lowest level of largely independent cash inflows and outflows for the related assets 
depending on the nature of the primary assets in the asset group  fair value is estimated using one of several approaches including replacement cost  appraised values  market quotes or estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and a held and used impairment of million for the anticipated closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill on an impairment only approach and amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings 
we operate as one reporting unit and an impairment charge would equal the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in our one reporting unit over its then fair value 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we perform our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we primarily recognize revenue from customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors  and these contracts may permit limited stock rotation returns 
we provide an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenue have been within management s expectations 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts 
revenue for these contracts are recorded under a percentage of completion method  which is based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion 
gross profit expected to be realized on fixed price contracts are based on periodic estimates of total revenues and costs for each contract 
losses on contracts are accrued when estimated total costs exceed total revenues 
occasionally  we will enter into contracts on a cost plus fee basis 
we recognize revenue based on reimbursements for actual expenses plus the contractually agreed upon fee with the customer 
restructuring charges we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded and can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability is recorded 
the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions and elimination of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability exists  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their expected termination dates and expected severance payments or when formal severance plans exist  when the severance payments are probable and reasonably estimable 
the elimination of excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated sublease income  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from the facilities 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises or ceased use of the facility 
stock based compensation compensation expense for stock options was calculated based on the date of grant or conversion using the black scholes option pricing model with exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the 
table of contents date of grant 
restricted stock awards were granted to employees with compensation expense determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options and restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if length of service requirements are unmet 
expected life was estimated based on historical exercise data that was stratified between members of the board of directors  executive employees and all other recipients 
expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility using equally weighted daily price observations over a period approximately equal to the expected life of each option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury securities with an equivalent remaining term 
no dividends are expected to be paid 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions when they meet a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we file us federal  state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
each quarter  we reassess our uncertain tax positions for any additions  deletions due to statute of limitation expiration  interest and penalties 
segment information we use the management approach for segment disclosure  which designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we manage our business on the basis of one reportable segment  as a manufacturer of semiconductors in different geographic areas  including the united states  europe and asia 
results of operations for compared to and net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for net sales decreased million or between and from million for estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for the last three fiscal years is approximately as follows amounts in thousands security defense aerospace enterprise commercial industrial alternative energy total 
table of contents net sales in the security defense end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
the increase between and was due primarily to the contributions from products we added from the acquisition of white electronic  as well as contributions from the ramping of millimeter wave scan subsystems used in whole body scanners and radar applications 
while net sales increased between and  this end market was impacted by our decision to reduce distributor sales of parts where we are the sole source supplier and begin to supply our end customers directly 
we expect growth in this end market as we believe the department of defense and homeland security budgets for electronic content  an area of microsemi focus  will continue to expand 
we also believe that international defense sales will increase  enabled in part by our anti tamper process technology base  and that microsemi s dollar content in defense programs will increase as our products move up the value chain 
as such  we believe that this end market will grow in the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the aerospace end market decreased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
net sales in have maintained relative stability when compared to  though this end market has been negatively impacted by global economic conditions 
the increase in net sales between and was driven primarily by demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  growing electronic content in current aircraft  refurbishment programs for older aircraft and demand for the high reliability radar and avionics solutions we provide 
sales into satellite applications have remained stable as generally these applications are in a less economically sensitive market and are expected to grow as we develop power management ics and dc dc converter solutions 
we noted a report from by the international air transport association that commercial air traffic is above pre recession levels  with passenger traffic up over year over year  while cargo traffic is up almost 
in reviewing these encouraging statistics  we believe that sales in this end market will grow in the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the enterprise commercial end market increased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
net sales in were negatively impacted as enterprise demand waned in a challenging economic environment and demand for parts used in automotive navigation systems and notebook storage products declined 
as economic conditions have improved  net sales increased sequentially in recent quarters  driven by poe and wireless lan products 
we believe that rapid market adoption of poe technology  especially by enterprise customers  has increased our market share and our wireless lan products are well accepted 
we have also gained market share at tier suppliers and tier oems and odms in the television market  though sales into these larger customers have recently declined and were offset by gains with newer china based manufacturers 
while this is our most economically sensitive end market  based on current and expected backlog  we expect that net sales in this end market will remain stable in the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the industrial alternative energy end market decreased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
the declines between and were due to products in medical applications that were impacted by lower procurement levels of icd products that are coming in line with moderating growth in the icd space 
sales into medical applications in also benefited from our support of a product launch schedule of a principal icd customer 
declines in this end market were offset in by growth in products for semiconductor capital equipment  an area which experienced substantial declines in due to decreased capital spending during the recent economic downturn 
we expect that increased shipments of industrial products  as well as contributions from our solar and plasma generation targeted products  will result in net sales increases in the upcoming quarter 

table of contents an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for  and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total net sales originating from asia increased million between and and decreased million between and primarily due to fluctuations in net sales of products  primarily in the enterprise commercial end market  shipped from our facilities and subcontractors in asia 
gross profit increased million between and  to million of sales for from million of sales for and decreased million between and from million of sales for gross profit percentage for was favorably impacted by cost optimization programs  which included the closure of our facility in colorado  ramp down of our facility in scottsdale  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities and reductions in personnel 
in  gross profit percentage was impacted basis points from inventory write downs related to product lines that do not meet gross margin targets  products that are being migrated to newer generations  products that service large capital spending end markets for which demand has declined and inventory at our scottsdale facility that we announced we are closing 
the remaining decline in gross profit percentage was due substantially to the effects of fixed costs allocated over lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million between and to million for from million for and increased million between and from million in selling  general and administrative expenses in were favorably impacted from restructuring and cost control measures but included million in acquisition related costs that are expenses under current gaap but would have been allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired in accordance with gaap in effect in prior years 
research and development expense increased million between and to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million in the increase between and was due to higher purchases of materials  masks and other supplies related to new product development for both high reliability and analog mixed signal products  as well as additional spending related to the white acquisition 
the decrease between and was primarily due to the effects of restructuring and cost control measures 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
amortization of intangible assets increased million between and to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in the increases reflect additional amortization expense related to acquisitions consummated in and restructuring charges amounted to million in compared to million in and million in restructuring costs in consisted of million in severance and million in other related costs and included amounts from the anticipated closure of our scottsdale manufacturing facility 
we anticipate that we will incur additional future restructuring charges related to the scottsdale closure for lease termination 
table of contents and facility remediation costs estimated to be approximately million 
these costs are expected to be incurred through restructuring charges in  and also included costs related to optimizing our personnel levels to meet production and costs goals 
impairment charges in related to facility closures represented the held for sale impairment for the building and real estate related to our closed broomfield  colorado facility amounting to million and the held and used impairment for our scottsdale manufacturing facility amounting to million to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
interest income decreased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
the decreases were due primarily to lower interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on pretax income of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million on a pre tax loss of million in we had cumulative operating losses over the three years ended in for our us operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain us deferred tax assets would not be realized 
key positive and negative evidence we considered in making this determination included recent history of cumulative operating losses for our us operations  future estimates of operating results for our us operations  and our ability to carry back our us operating losses  tax credits and reversing temporary differences to recover previously paid taxes 
based on this assessment  we determined that a valuation allowance was required for the deferred tax assets related to our us operations that could not be carried back to recover previously paid taxes 
accordingly  we recorded a million valuation allowance on a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets  which is included in the total tax provision of million 
without this valuation allowance  we would have reported a tax benefit of approximately million due to higher tax benefits in the jurisdictions with losses than tax expenses in the jurisdictions with income 
during we decreased the valuation allowance by million primarily due to the utilization of certain foreign net operating losses and the recording of the deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of white electronic designs corporation 
as referenced in the subsequent events footnote to our consolidated financial statements  we acquired actel corporation in november  and as a result  we anticipate that we may record a deferred tax liability related to the acquired intangible assets  and  therefore  release a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets 
in addition  due to historical and projected levels of foreign income  we anticipate that we may release a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets 
capital resources and liquidity we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents at october  and september   respectively 
during  we financed our operations with cash generated from operations 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in a summary of net cash provided by operating activities in and are as follows amounts in thousands net income loss depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts loss on disposition of assets impairment related to facility closures in process research and development deferred income taxes valuation allowance on deferred income taxes stock based compensation net change in working capital accounts net change in other long term assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities accounts receivable increased million to million at october  from million at september  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of  but also benefited from increased collection efforts 
inventories increased million to million at october  from million at september  a majority of the increase was due to inventory balances related to the acquisition of white electronic designs corporation 
the remaining increase was due to additional build in anticipation of the scottsdale facility closure and increased inventory to support continued business growth 
other current assets decreased million to million at october  from million at september  the decrease was primarily due to the receipt of income tax refunds 
current liabilities decreased million to million at october  from million at september  the decrease was due to a reduction of million  which is classified in financing activities  in amounts outstanding under our auction rate securities credit facility following issuer redemptions of auction rate bonds we held offset by higher accounts payable due primarily to increased inventory purchases 
net cash used in investing activities was million for and million for  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year primarily consisted of million in net cash consideration for three acquisitions  purchases of property and equipment of million  partially offset by million from the disposition of investments in available for sale securities 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment between and was due primarily to the start up of our philippine operations 
net cash used in investing activities in primarily consisted of million in net cash consideration for three acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment of million  partially offset by million from the disposition of investments in available for sale securities and million in net proceeds from the divesture of assets related to the semicoa business 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million and million in and in  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in consisted of million related to stock award activity partially offset by million used to repay amounts outstanding under our auction rate securities credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million in proceeds from our auction rate securities credit facility and million related to stock award activity 

table of contents as of october  all auction rate securities held on september  were redeemed at par plus accrued interest by the issuers of the securities 
we held no auction rate securities at october  the proceeds from the redemption of the auction rate securities were used to repay amounts outstanding on the auction rate securities credit facility 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility was scheduled to mature on october  the revolving credit facility provided for a revolving line of credit of up to million the maximum commitment

table of contents as of october   we recorded million in long term liabilities for accrued taxes related to uncertain tax positions and are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the liability related to uncertain tax positions has not been included in the contractual obligations table 
in acquiring actel corporation  we assumed their contractual payments obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our current estimate of contractual payment obligations related to this acquisition as october  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements

the fasb issued in october and april additional authoritative guidance on determining fair value in an inactive market and when volume and level of activity have significantly decreased 
the adoption did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired  and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
among other changes  this statement also requires that negative goodwill be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition and that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
in december  the fasb also issued authoritative guidance related to non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements

table of contents in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a final consensus on authoritative guidance that concluded that a defensive intangible asset should be considered a separate unit of accounting and not combined with an existing asset whose value it may enhance 
in addition  a useful life should be assigned that reflects the acquiring entity s consumption of the defensive asset s expected benefits 
this authoritative guidance will be applied prospectively for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  our fiscal year 
subsequent to the adoption of this guidance  we have not entered into a transaction that is impacted by this guidance and as such  the adoption has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which provides clarification for measuring fair value when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
asu no 
also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
asu no 
was effective for us beginning after september  the adoption did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 which eliminates the criterion for objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered products or services 
instead  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting provided the deliverables meet certain criteria 
asu no 
provides a hierarchy for estimating the selling price for each of the deliverables 
asu no 
eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  our fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of this accounting standards update on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 which requires new fair value disclosures pertaining to significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and activity 
for level fair value measurements  purchases  sales  issuances and settlements must be reported on a gross basis 
further  additional disclosures are required by class of assets or liabilities  as well as inputs used to measure fair value and valuation techniques 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  our second quarter of fiscal year  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
the adoption of the effective portions of this asu did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining portions of this asu will result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amends subsequent event disclosure requirements for sec filers 
an entity that is an sec filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this asu was effective upon issuance and adoption did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results or operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone under fasb codification topic and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones that should be evaluated individually 
the amendments to this asu are effective on a 
table of contents prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption did not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  but may affect the timing of revenue recognition in future periods should future contracts include milestone provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in credit risk  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates or the stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  which are related to credit risks  changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and changes in certain interest rates 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consisting principally of trade accounts receivable 
concentrations of credit risk exist because we rely on a significant portion of customers whose principal sales are to the us government 
approximately of total net sales in were in the security defense end market  with a very significant amount to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we  as a subcontractor  sell our products to higher tier subcontractors or to prime contractors based upon purchase orders that usually do not contain all of the conditions included in the prime contract with the us government 
however these sales are usually subject to termination and or price renegotiations by virtue of their reference to a us government prime contract 
therefore  we believe that all of our product sales that ultimately are sold to the us government may be subject to termination  at the convenience of the us government or to price renegotiations under the renegotiation act 
we have never experienced a material loss due to termination of a u 
s government contract 
we have never had to renegotiate our price under any government contract 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility was scheduled to mature on october  the revolving credit facility provided for a revolving line of credit of up to million the maximum commitment 
the revolving credit facility was available for direct borrowings and  subject to the maximum commitment  up to million of the revolving credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility could be used for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 
as of october   the company had no direct borrowings and  in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
on october   the revolving credit facility was terminated and all letters of credit outstanding thereunder were cancelled in anticipation of the company entering into the new credit facility described below 
interest accruing on the amount of direct borrowings under the new credit facility was determined based upon our choice of either a base rate loan or a eurodollar rate loan 
the interest rate per annum for base rate loans was determined by reference to the higher of the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate as announced by bank of america  na and a libor rate determined as provided in the new credit facility plus  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for base rate loans was initially per annum but could decrease to or increase to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated 
table of contents funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as each such term was defined in the new credit facility 
eurodollar rate loans bore interest at the eurodollar rate defined in the new credit facility  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans was initially per annum but could decrease to or increase to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
on november   we entered into a credit agreement with morgan stanley senior funding  inc mssf  morgan stanley co 
incorporated  east west bank  raymond james bank  fsb and the lenders referred to therein the credit agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  mssf has provided  senior secured first lien credit facilities the facilities  consisting of a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of  and a revolving credit facility the revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of  the facilities financed the acquisition of actel corporation and fees and expenses related thereto 
the revolving facility is also available for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
for further information regarding the credit agreement  including interest rates  fees  and financial covenants  please refer to the subsequent events footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
interest under the facilities are  at our option  base rate as defined below or libor  plus a margin ranging from to for base rate based loans that are either term loans or revolving loans and ranging from to for libor based loans that are either term loans or revolving loans  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the base rate for term loans is equal to per annum and for revolving loans is a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the highest of a the prime rate  b of per annum above the federal funds effective rate and c one month libor plus 
interest for base rate based loans is calculated on the basis of a day year and interest for libor based loans is calculated on the basis of a day year 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate risks 
however  pursuant to the requirements of the credit agreement  we will hedge at least of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan for a weighted average term of at least three years
