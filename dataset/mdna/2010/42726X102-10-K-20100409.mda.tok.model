item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general heritage financial group is the parent holding company of heritagebank of the south 
the company is in a mutual holding company structure and of its outstanding common stock is owned by heritage  mhc  a federal mutual holding company 
the principal business of the company is operating our wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting of savings and checking accounts  money market accounts  time deposits  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings 
our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  transaction fees  bank owned life insurance  and commissions from investment services 
noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing  advertising  professional fees and other costs 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
evolution of business strategy we originally were chartered as a federal credit union in in  we became a community chartered credit union 
we accepted deposits and made loans to members who lived  worked or worshiped in the approved counties for the credit union charter 
in  we converted to a mutual thrift charter in order to better serve our customers and communities through a broader lending ability and an expanded customer base beyond the field of membership permitted for our credit union 
the mutual holding company structure was established in  and we converted from a thrift charter to a state savings bank charter in we feel this structure best suits our continued efforts to grow and expand our commercial business 
the company completed an initial public stock offering on june  we sold  shares of common stock in that offering at per share 
the company s employee stock ownership plan the esop purchased  shares in the offering with the proceeds of a loan from the company 
the company received net proceeds of million in the public offering  of which was contributed to the bank and million of which was loaned to the esop for its purchase of shares in the offering 
the company also issued an additional  shares of common stock to mhc  so that mhc would own of the outstanding common stock at the closing of the offering 
our current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized and profitable commercial and retail financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of our customers 
we strive to be the primary financial institution in the market areas we serve 
we offer a broad range of products and services while stressing personalized and efficient customer service and convenient access to these products and services 
we intend to continue to operate as a commercial and consumer lender 
we have structured operations around a branch system that is staffed with knowledgeable and well trained employees 
subject to capital requirements and our ability to grow in a reasonable and prudent manner  we may open or acquire additional branches as opportunities arise 
in addition to our branch system  we continue to expand electronic services for our customers 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a higher level of customer service 
our core business is composed of the following commercial banking and small business lending we focus on the commercial real estate and business needs of individuals and small to medium sized businesses in our market area 
in addition  we focus on high net worth individuals and small business owners 
the commercial banking department is composed of seasoned commercial lenders and a support staff with years of combined experience in the industry 
we expect this department to continue to be the fastest growing component of our business 
retail banking we operate a network of seven branch offices located in dougherty  lee  worth and tattnall counties in georgia  two branches located in ocala  florida  and one branch located in lake city  florida 
in addition  we have announced expansion plans to add five branches in four additional markets in each office is staffed with knowledgeable banking professionals who strive to deliver quality service 
brokerage investment services we offer investment products  life  health  disability and long term care insurance through our brokerage department 
our licensed personnel have over years of experience in the financial services industry 
mortgage lending staffed with experienced mortgage originators and processors  our mortgage lending department originates residential mortgage loans that are primarily funded by third party mortgage lenders 
we collect a fee on the origination of these loans 
we continue to implement this business strategy 
a critical component of this strategy includes increasing our non consumer based lending 
at the end of  our commercial real estate  nonresidential  business  multifamily  farmland  and construction loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio 
our ability to continue to grow our commercial loan portfolio is an important element of our long term business strategy 
these non consumer based loans are considered to entail greater risks than one to four family residential loans 
another key component of our business strategy is the expansion of our operations beyond the southwest georgia market 
on august   we commenced operating a branch in ocala  florida 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of the tattnall bank in reidsville and collins  georgia  through an fdic assisted transaction 
on december   we acquired the lake city  florida branch of atlantic coast bank 
as of december   we had approximately million or of our loans and million or of our deposits generated outside of our southwest georgia market 
operating a branch outside of the southwest georgia market subjects us to additional risk factors 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to the following management of employees from a distance  lack of knowledge of the local market  additional credit risks  logistical operational issues  and time constraints of management 
these risk factors  as well as others we have not specifically identified  may affect our ability to successfully operate outside of our current market area 
on february   we announced that the bank signed a definitive agreement to purchase five bank branches from the park avenue bank 
these branches are located in the southeast georgia markets of statesboro  hazlehurst and baxley  and the southwest georgia market of adel 
we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of  subject to regulatory approval 
on march   the company adopted a plan to reorganize from a two tier mutual holding company to a full stock holding company and will undertake a second step offering of shares of the holding company s common stock 
the conversion and offering is expected to be completed in the third quarter of  subject to regulatory  stockholder and depositor approvals 
as part of the reorganization  heritagebank of the south will become a wholly owned subsidiary of a to be formed stock corporation  heritage financial group  inc shares of the common stock of the company  other than those held by heritage  mhc  will be converted into shares of common stock in heritage financial group  inc  using an exchange ratio designed to preserve current percentage ownership interests 
shares owned by heritage  mhc will be retired  and new shares representing that ownership will be offered and sold to the bank s eligible depositors  the bank s tax qualified employee benefit plans and to members of the general public as set forth in the plan of conversion and reorganization of heritage  mhc 
the plan of conversion and reorganization of heritage  mhc will be submitted to the office of thrift supervision and the georgia department of banking and finance for regulatory approval 
upon receipt of regulatory approvals  the company will seek approval from its stockholders and members of heritage  mhc 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  a increase from december   to million at december  the increase was due primarily to our acquisition activity in the fourth quarter of  which provided us with million in cash  million in loans and million in deposits 
total interest earning assets increased million or to million at december   from million at december  gross loans increased million or to million at december   compared with million at december   due primarily to the previously mentioned acquisition activity 
investment securities increased million or to million at december  federal funds purchased decreased million or to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to our efforts to reduce the amounts we maintain at correspondent banks by shifting more liquid assets to our interest bearing account at the federal reserve 
interest bearing deposits in banks increased million to at december  this was due primarily to funds obtained through our acquisition activity in the fourth quarter of we have maintained excess liquidity for three purposes 
first  we believe it is prudent to maintain higher liquidity during uncertain economic times 
second  we believe this excess liquidity gives us additional flexibility in our acquisition strategy 
third  we believe this excess liquidity will provide us flexibility for funding loans or other investments if we see a dramatic rise in interest rates 
maintaining excess liquidity does cause net interest margin to decrease in the short term  however  we feel the benefits of maintaining excess liquidity outweighs the cost to net interest margin 
we expect to continue to maintain excess liquidity during foreclosed assets decreased  to million at december  other real estate owned oreo comprised the majority of the decrease 
during the year  approximately  of oreo was transferred in from the loan portfolio  and approximately  was acquired in our fdic assisted acquisition in the fourth quarter of we sold million of oreo in  and we wrote down  on oreo properties 
the largest single balance in our oreo portfolio was  at december  approximately  of our oreo portfolio at december   consisted of undeveloped lots or vacant land 
repossessed personal property remained relatively level at intangible assets increased  due to our acquisition activity in the fourth quarter of cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli increased by  due to the earnings on boli policies in place 
other assets increased million 
 of which was due to an increase in deferred tax assets stemming from the nature of our net loss in million of the increase was due to our required prepayment of fdic assessments in the fourth quarter of million of the increase was due to the establishment of a receivable from the fdic in connection with our fdic assisted acquisition in the fourth quarter of total liabilities increased million or to million at december   compared with million at december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in interest bearing liabilities  which increased million or  to million at december   from million at december  deposits ended the year at million  up or million from million from december  this increase was attributable to our acquisition activity 
total federal home loan bank advances amounted to million at december   a decrease of million or from december  we paid these advances down as maturities occurred in with funds received from our deposit growth 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million during  primarily due to a decrease in fed funds purchased from the chattahoochee bank of georgia chattahoochee 
total equity decreased by million or to million at december  a net loss of million  dividends of  and the purchase of  of treasury stock decreased equity 
compensation expense related to the allocation of esop shares of  stock based compensation expense of  and other comprehensive income of  partially offset the decrease in equity

it distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years 
changes that are not solely due to volume have been consistently attributed to rate

further explanations of these changes are discussed in more detail in the following sections 
interest income interest income decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  a basis point decrease on yield in earnings assets  primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates  accounted for million of the decrease  while a decrease in average balances during the year of million accounted for  of the decrease 
the decrease in average earning assets was due to a decrease in loan demand during the year 
in the fourth quarter  our acquisition activity led to an increase in earning assets by year end 
however  these additions of earning assets late in the year did not make up for the decline in average balances that had occurred earlier in the year 
interest expense interest expense decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities accounted for million of the decrease  while a decrease in average balances  primarily wholesale deposits  accounted for  of the decrease 
net interest income net interest income decreased  or to million compared with million for the twelve months ending our net interest spread increased basis points to compared with during the year earlier period 
the net interest margin increased basis points to versus during the same period in average interest earning assets decreased million or to million at december   compared with million at december  average interest bearing liabilities decreased  or to million compared with million at december  the federal reserve board has made extreme moves in interest rates  dropping the federal funds rate from a high of in mid down to its current level of a targeted range of zero to 
these decreases in the federal funds rate caused our net interest margin to decline during and the first half of during the second half of  we saw our net interest margin improve 
the primary driver of this improvement was a decrease in our cost of interest bearing liabilities 
this occurred as we were able to lower our deposit rates  and as our structured repurchase agreements priced lower during the year 
we also reduced our wholesale time deposits from million at december  to million at december  during  we also reduced our other borrowings by million 
for more information on interest rate changes  and the effects those changes may have on earnings  please see item a in this form k 
provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loans losses of million in compared with million for the prior year period 
net charge offs of million were part of the reason for the increase in loan loss provision expense for non performing loans increased million to million at december   compared with million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans increased to compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased by basis points to compared with at december  the largest non performing loan in our portfolio at december  was a million loan on raw land in atlanta  georgia 
this land was originally purchased for commercial and residential development 
however  due to the economic environment in the area  this is no longer a viable alternative 
the original amount of this loan was million  and in we charged off million on this loan 
in march of  we foreclosed on this property  and we currently have this property under contract for million 
the next largest non performing loan at december  was million and is secured by various airplanes 
in the fourth quarter of  we charged this relationship down by million 
in february of  the collateral securing this loan was liquidated and the proceeds were applied to the balance of the loan 
we then charged off an additional  to cover the shortfall of the collateral sale 
the next largest non performing loan at december  was a real estate loan for  secured by a restaurant building in ocala  florida 
our next largest non performing loan at december  was a real estate loan for  secured by various residential rental properties in southwest georgia 
the remainder of our non performing loans consist of various consumer and commercial loans  none exceeding  current appraisals on real estate loans  expected costs of potential foreclosure or other disposition  and other potential losses on these loans are considered in our analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
loans past due or more days and still accruing totaled million  or of total loans at december  this compares to million at december   or of loans 
we had no loans past due or more days and still accruing at december  or our internally criticized and classified assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  these balances include the aforementioned nonperforming loans  other real estate  and repossessed assets 
our internal loan review processes strive to identify weaknesses in loans prior to performance issues 
however  our processes do not always provide sufficient time to work out plans with borrowers that would avoid foreclosure and or losses 
we continue to see weakness in our loan portfolio  and as economic conditions remain difficult  we expect this trend to continue until we see improvement in the overall economy 
we have taken actions to prevent losses in our current portfolio  including the appointment of a loan officer as a full time special assets manager  who is responsible for working out credits with identified weaknesses 
we have also taken steps to better evaluate the capital and liquidity positions of our commercial loan guarantors  particularly those involved in commercial real estate construction and development 
this includes further analysis of our guarantors financial position  liquidity  cash flow and contingent liabilities 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level we believe will reflect probable credit losses based on historical loss trends and an evaluation of specific credits in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and past due status and trends 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the proper level of allowance 
while we use available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
the level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates 
noninterest income a summary of noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  follows for the years ended chg chg dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees brokerage fees mortgage origination fees bank owned life insurance other total noninterest income noninterest income as a percentage of average assets the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was due to a decrease in overdraft fees 
during the year  we saw a decrease in the amount of depositors who overdrew their accounts 
this was specifically true of our overdraft privilege program  which allows customers who meet certain standards to have their overdrafts covered up to  including checks  drafts  ach  debit card and atm transactions 
we expect to continue to see decreased revenue in this area 
in addition  recent regulatory changes to the offering of overdraft privilege on atm and debit card may cause significant decreases in our overdraft fees 
at this time  we are unable to accurately estimate the effect this legislation  and other potential legislation  may have on our overdraft income 
we are currently analyzing our options to replace this income stream if it is significantly affected by legislation or by a significant change in consumer behavior 
these options will most likely result in a major change in the fees we charge to our deposit customers 
the increase in other service charges  commissions and fees was due primarily to an increase in debit and atm transaction fees 
our customers continue to increase debit card usage instead of using cash or checks 
we expect this trend to continue  despite a decrease in consumer spending 
the decrease in our brokerage fees was due primarily to a decrease in assets under management  and thus a reduction in our asset management fees 
this decrease was caused by market conditions and not by a decrease in the number of clients we serve in this business 
in addition  as market conditions worsened in late and early  we saw a decrease in commissions earned as our clients became less active in the equity markets 
mortgage fees decreased due to a slowdown in the real estate market for new sales and a slowdown in refinance activity 
in addition  stricter underwriting standards required by our investors and regulatory changes have caused an increase in the amount of time it takes to process each loan  which could cause a decrease in revenue 
we expect this trend to continue throughout  unless we see significant improvement in the economy 
earnings on bank owned life insurance policies increased due to the purchase of an additional million of cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies in the middle of was the first full year of earnings on this addition 
other noninterest income decreased by  due to a decrease in fhlb stock dividends 
we received  of fhlb dividends in  however  we are uncertain about the level of dividends we may receive in the future 
 of the decrease was due to a gain on the sale of a real estate partnership we recorded in with no similar gain in noninterest expense a summary of noninterest expense follows for the years ended december  chg chg dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits equipment occupancy advertising and marketing legal and accounting directors fees and retirement consulting and other professional fees telecommunications supplies data processing fees loss on sale and write downs of other real estate owned foreclosed asset expenses fdic insurance and other regulatory fees impairment loss on premises held for sale nm other operating total noninterest expenses noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets the decrease in salaries was due primarily to efforts to keep staffing levels in line with the lack of demand in our lines of business 
however  with our acquisition activity in the fourth quarter of  we have increased our full time equivalent employees from at december   to at december  in addition  we may hire additional staff in our finance  operations and credit areas to assist with our acquisition activity in equipment and occupancy expenses decreased primarily because due to cost reduction measures we implemented to offset declines in revenue 
however  we expect equipment and occupancy to increase in due to the addition of three new branches in the fourth quarter of  and the planned addition of five branches in advertising and marketing decreased due to our efforts to cut expenses in due to our acquisition activity  we expect advertising and marketing expenses to increase in the decrease in legal and accounting fees was due to a decrease in legal fees associated with collection efforts 
however  these fees remain at historically high levels due to the elevated level of problem assets 
we expect these costs to remain elevated until we see decreases in problem assets 
directors fees remained level in we expect these fees to increase in due to the addition of local advisory boards related to our acquisition activity 
consulting and other professional fees decreased primarily due to our efforts to reduce expenses in in  these fees may increase as we use consultants and other professionals to assist with our analysis of acquisition opportunities  and with the subsequent integration of any such acquisitions 
telecommunication expenses decreased due to our efforts to cut expenses in as we increase our branch network  we expect these fees to increase 
supply expenses remained level in  however  we expect those expenses to increase due to our acquisition activity 
data processing expenses increased due to the increased amount of debit card transactions in and increases in other data processing fees 
in  our core processing contract terminates 
we are currently negotiating this contract  and expect to receive a reduction in rates 
however  our acquisition activity may cause this total expense to increase despite the reduction we expect to receive in per account charges under the new contract 
the loss on sale and write down of other real estate owned increased due to the increased amount of other real estate owned and efforts to dispose of these properties 
we expect that these expenses will remain elevated until levels of other real estate owned are reduced 
foreclosed asset expenses also increased significantly due to the increased level of foreclosed assets 
we expect that these expenses will also remain elevated until levels of other real estate and repossessions are reduced 
the increase in fdic insurance and other regulatory fees was due to an increase in fdic insurance during  as well as a special assessment of  we expect fdic insurance and other regulatory fees to remain high based on the increased level of deposits  and the amount of bank failure expenses that the fdic is incurring 
the decrease in other operating expenses was due primarily to our efforts to cut expenses in income tax expense income tax benefits were  more for the year ended december  as compared with the increase in tax benefits was partially due to an increase in the loss before taxes of  along with other factors 
due to the losses incurred in and  a comparison of effective tax rates is not meaningful 
due to the losses we have incurred in and  we have increased our deferred tax assets to million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  we analyze our deferred tax assets for potential impairment  and have determined that there is no impairment as of december  liquidity and capital resources we are required to have enough cash and investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
the company had million in cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks generally available for its cash needs as of december  the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and maturing short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
the bank also generates cash through borrowings  primarily from federal home loan bank advances  to leverage its capital base  provide funds for its lending and investment activities and enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments  such as overnight deposits and federal funds 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities  including mortgage backed securities 
the bank uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  pay maturing deposits  fund withdrawals and fund loan commitments 
at december   the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to million  and outstanding letters of credit were  certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
it is management s policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions  based on our needs and potential uses of the funds 
based on this management strategy  we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the bank 
in addition  the bank had the ability  at december   to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and million from other lenders as a funding source to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes 
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and  details cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  while investing activities provided million  primarily from acquisition activity  and financing activities used million primarily to reduce non core deposits and other borrowings  resulting in a net increase in cash during the twelve month period of million 
in march  we purchased a lot in the southwest georgia market for  for potential future expansion 
we are currently planning to build a branch on this site  and will start construction later in  but have not determined the cost of such an expansion 
off balance sheet liabilities the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
a summary of the company s commitments as of december  is as follows in thousands commitments to extend credit financial stand by letters of credit capital effective january   the company and the bank became subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the georgia department of banking and finance 
as of that same date  the bank also became subject to minimum capital requirements and capital categories established by the fdic 
based on their capital levels at december   the company and the bank exceeded these state and federal requirements 
consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization  our policy is for the bank to maintain a well capitalized status under the capital categories of the fdic 
based on capital levels at december   the bank was considered to be well capitalized 
at december   the company had total equity of million or of total assets 
under georgia capital requirements for holding companies  the company had tier leverage capital of million or  which is million above the requirement

our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by us represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses in the loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in the jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
after converting to a federally chartered savings association  the bank became a taxable organization 
income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
since the bank s transition to a federally chartered thrift  the bank has recorded income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by the company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review of the positions we have taken by taxing authorities could result in adjustments to our financial statements 
estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  goodwill  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
for more information on the company s accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market rates change over time 
like other financial institutions  our results of operations are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in doing so  we analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and payment streams  timing of maturities  repricing opportunities  and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
to manage the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on our results of operations  we adopted asset and liability management policies to understand  measure  monitor  and control the risk 
these policies are designed to allow us to implement strategies to minimize the effects of interest rate changes to net income and capital position by properly matching the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these policies are implemented by the risk management committee  which is composed of senior management and board members 
the risk management committee establishes guidelines for and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources  taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity requirements 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that limit negative changes in net income and capital while supporting liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
senior managers oversee the process on a daily basis 
the risk management committee meets quarterly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk exposure  liquidity position and net portfolio present value 
the committee also recommends strategy changes  as appropriate  based on their review 
the committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on limiting the percentage of long term fixed rate loans within our portfolio  originating a mix of variable rate and shorter term fixed rate loans  originating prime based home equity lines of credit  managing deposit relationships for stability and a lower cost of funds position  using federal home loan bank advances and other funding sources to align maturities and repricing terms of funding sources with loans  and continuing the origination of consumer loans 
the risk management committee has oversight over the asset liability management of the company 
this committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net income and the market value of portfolio equity 
market value of portfolio equity is a measurement of the value of the balance sheet at a fixed point in time 
it is summarized as the fair value of assets less the fair value of liabilities 
the committee reviews computations of the value of capital at current interest rates and alternative interest rates 
the variance in the net portfolio value between current interest rate computations and alternative rate computations represents the potential impact on capital if rates were to change 
the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes  and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company monitors its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to hedge this risk 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the company uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allows management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a shock in interest rates of   and basis point increase or decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
we also monitor regulatory required interest rate risk analysis which simulates more dramatic changes to rates 
the company s strategy is to mitigate interest risk to the greatest extent possible 
based on our analysis of the company s overall risk to changes in interest rates  we structure investment and funding transactions to reduce this risk 
these strategies aim to achieve neutrality to interest rate risk 
although we strive to have our net interest income neutral to changes in rates  due to the inherent nature of our business  we will never be completely neutral to changes in rates 
as of december   a drop in interest rates would increase our net interest income and an increase in rates would increase our net interest income  also known as liability sensitive 
during and  we put minimum interest rate requirements  also known as floors  in our prime based floating rate loans 
these floors are generally to basis points above their current index rate 
these floors allowed us to earn a higher rate of interest than we would have otherwise earned during and however  due to these floors  many of our loans will not reprice when rates rise  until the increase in rates exceeds the loan floor 
this lag in repricing is part of the reason we are liability sensitive over the next year in a rising rate environment 
we feel that the level of interest rate risk is at an acceptable level  and is within our internal policy limits 
the company maintains a risk management committee which monitors and analyzes interest rate risk 
this committee is comprised of members of senior management and outside directors 
this committee meets on a monthly basis and reviews the simulations listed above  as well as other interest rate risk reports 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates 
at december  maturing or repricing within zero to three three months to one to five over five months one year years years total earning assets short term assets investment securities loans interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market time deposits other borrowings fhlb advances interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio the following table shows the results of our projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for an immediate change or shock in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
due to the historically low level of interest rates  we do not believe downward shocks greater than basis points are relevant 
in addition  due to the historically low interest rate environment  there is concern that we may say dramatic increases in interest rates when they begin to rise 
to address this concern  we increased our upward interest rates shocks to include a shock of basis points
