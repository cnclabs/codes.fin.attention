executive overview in  market structure changes continued to impact our businesses  particularly our traditional cash equity market making  formerly specialist  division 
this division  which once accounted for all of our revenues  made the transition in december to a designated market maker dmm model from a specialist model 
while very significant changes had been made in the role of the specialist with the implementation of the hybrid market  the dmm role in evolved to a business almost entirely focused on capturing liquidity payments or rebates as the primary source of revenue rather than relying on principal trading revenues 
this evolution was primarily caused by the increased proliferation of competing electronic market places and dark pools that reduced the nyse s participation in order flow of its listed securities 
this transition required us to make some important decisions regarding the future of our company which we discuss below 
management  recognizing that market structure changes made it necessary to diversify business lines  had for years made considerable progress in this regard 
we successfully expanded our non traditional market making businesses and  as a result  beginning in  our specialist dmm market making business accounted for less than half of our revenues 
we also expanded our non traditional market making operations internationally 
as we became more dependent on revenues in options and efts  results in those businesses began to significantly affect our overall results 
negative results in our domestic options market making division led to operating losses for  even though our international etf and domestic foreign currency options market making businesses were profitable 
several factors contributed to the domestic options market making trading losses we reported in one important factor was the departure of our senior options trading team in january management made the decision to hire a new group to run the options business and at the same time made the decision to significantly reduce the trading positions of the traders who had left the firm 
the reduction in the positions of the traders who left the firm resulted in revenue declines  which almost entirely accounted for the losses that were reported for the first quarter of losses in the second quarter of were attributable again to the unwinding of previous options market making positions  and to a lesser extent  costs associated with new positions taken by our options trading team 
after continuing to experience losses in the third quarter of  again attributable to options market making activities  our options group  working with senior management  made the decision to shorten the maturities of our options positions so that the substantial majority of those positions would mature and unwind by the middle of january we decided to follow this strategy because the revenues gained by providing liquidity in those option contracts were not sufficient to offset the costs associated with taking positions  including financing costs and exchange  clearing and brokerage fees 
we also believed that such an approach would give us additional financial flexibility in this strategy has given us an ability to reallocate capital in in addition  our more measured and deliberate approach to adding new options positions enabled us to report meaningful positive results for the fourth quarter of with our trading activities outside our dmm business increasingly influencing our results  the changes in market structure that affected our dmm division did not allow for the necessary operating leverage to mitigate 
table of contents the losses at our options group  even though the traditional cash equity market making division continued to generate cash 
moreover  the costs and regulatory limitations of being in the dmm business constrained our financial and operational flexibility 
the net liquid asset requirement of the dmm business was one such substantial cost to us  because  as of december   it required us to segregate million that could not be deployed for other business opportunities or strategic options 
in addition  management has viewed our public debt as a financing cost to fund the dmm business net liquid asset requirement  which  as recently as two years ago  was million 
management accordingly repurchased significant portions of our public debt each time the nyse has reduced our net liquid asset requirement 
in  we paid approximately million in interest on our public debt 
management determined that it was in the best interest of our company to eliminate that expense 
all of these factors led to the decision to sell our dmm business and to redeem all of our outstanding public debt in january we also reduced our position in nyx shares in the fourth quarter of and early to approximately million shares from approximately million shares 
following the sale of our dmm business  we now will focus on options  etfs and foreign currency option market making  as well as institutional brokerage services 
we have a clean and liquid balance sheet 
we have substantially reduced our operating overhead 
we believe we are now able to better respond to changes and opportunities that are taking place in our businesses 
in light of recent events  including the sale of our dmm business  we are exploring an initiative to combine our domestic broker dealers 
we cannot currently estimate the timing or achievability of this potential combination of broker dealers but we are committed to making our domestic broker dealer operations more integrated and streamlined in a manner that was not permitted by regulatory requirements that no longer apply to us after the sale of our dmm business 
new accounting developments fair value measurements in october  the fasb issued asc fsp fas which clarifies the application of asc sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
the fsp shall be effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate pursuant to asc sfas 
the disclosure provisions of asc sfas for a change in accounting estimate are not required for revisions resulting from a change in valuation technique or its application 
as of december   we do not hold any securities that would be subject to change based on asc fsp fas 
accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities asc asu will allow investors to use the net asset value of investments in investment companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value if the investees have the attributes of investment companies and the net asset values are calculated consistent with the aicpa audit and accounting guide  investment companies  which generally requires investments to be measured at fair value 
this proposal will not have any effect on our financial position 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after december   and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of asc fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement improves the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its 
table of contents financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
this statement is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after november   and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to asc fasb interpretation no 
r sfas 
this statement which eliminates exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities  contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this statement clarifies  but does not significantly change  the characteristics that identify a variable interest entity 
this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of asc sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date in estimating the fair value of our market making reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of the fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill annually as of december  unless an event or change in circumstances requires an interim reassessment of impairment 
during the year ended december   there were no changes in circumstances that necessitated goodwill impairment testing prior to our required year end test date 
on january  we sold the dmm business of labranche co llc for million to barclays 
as a result of this sale  we valued our goodwill at million as the sales price provided the valuation for our intangibles 
as this was considered the best indicator of fair value for the intangibles in this segment  we impaired the remaining goodwill assets to this value at december  historically  one of our intangible assets  as defined under asc sfas no 
 was our trade name 
we determined the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate 
table of contents royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
as a result of the sale of labranche co 
llc s dmm business on january   labranche co 
llc would no longer be able to trade as a dmm for a period of three years subsequent to the sale 
the tradename was an asset of labranche co 
llc  the nyse dmm broker dealer 
as a result of a significant decline of future revenue and the inability to act as an nyse dmm or market maker  we determined that the trade name intangible asset would be fully impaired at december  financial instruments financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value are reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements  at fair value  on a recurring basis 
pursuant to asc sfas no 
 the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  or the exit price  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or asc sfas no 
fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc sfas no 
outlines a fair value hierarchy that is used to determine the value to be reported 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities which are considered level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs which are considered level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under asc sfas no 
are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions would reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
such valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
non marketable securities the measurement of non marketable securities is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies and limited liability company interests of service provider entities and therefore are included in other assets or financial instruments owned in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition due to the nature of business in which we have an investment 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  unless there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities  we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting pursuant to asc apb 
under the equity method the investor recognizes its share of the earnings and losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements 
these assets included in other assets represent limited liability companies that are service providers and whose value is affected by nonfinancial components 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to 
table of contents non marketable securities in estimating their value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
non marketable investments are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that such investment s carrying value may be impaired 
use of estimates the use of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with asc sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and asc fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
see legal proceedings in part ii  item of this quarterly report on form q for information on our judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
completed purchases of outstanding indebtedness as of december   our aggregate outstanding indebtedness consisted of million of our senior notes due on february  the redemption date  we fully redeemed and cancelled all of our remaining outstanding public indebtedness pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing our public debt 
on the redemption date  all of our remaining note holders were paid of the principal amount of their notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the redemption date 
therefore  as of february   we have no remaining outstanding public debt  resulting in a reduction of our interest expense by approximately million per year 
on january   we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing our outstanding public debt by irrevocably depositing with us bank national association the trustee for the indebtedness cash in an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of the redemption price for the senior notes on the redemption date  together with irrevocable instructions from our directing us bank to apply such funds to the payment of the senior notes on the redemption date 
thus  as of january   we were no longer obligated or restricted under the indenture governing our public debt 
stock purchases and completed tender offer on january   we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock  at a price of per share 
on march   the tender offer expired and we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  for a total tender price of million 
the repurchase of the shares tendered  combined with the  shares repurchased by us pursuant to board authorized purchases over the past months  have resulted in our repurchasing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  constituting an aggregate of of our shares that were outstanding before any repurchase were made under our repurchase programs 

table of contents george ml labranche  iv  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  tendered  shares of the  shares he beneficially owned representing of the outstanding shares in the tender offer 
other than mr 
labranche  none of our directors and executive officers tendered any of their shares in the tender offer 
upon completion of the tender offer  we have approximately million shares issued and outstanding 
following completion of the tender offer  we have approximately million in board authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program 
repurchases may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  in a tender offer  dutch auction or otherwise  in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws 
the timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors  including price and regulatory requirements

cash capital available is mainly comprised of stockholders equity  long term debt  subordinated debt and other liabilities of our parent holding company which  in the aggregate  constitute the currency used to purchase our assets and provide our working capital

these 
table of contents expenditures represent the majority of the decrease in available cash at the holding company from december  to december  the intercompany market making loans were fully repaid to our holding company on january  our management has always viewed its core assets to be its trading equity in brokerage accounts  which consist of net financial instruments  broker dealer receivables payables  and cash available at the holding company and subsidiaries 
effectively  these are the liquid assets used primarily to provide liquidity in the market making and institutional brokerage businesses  as well as to grow our company 
millions market making institutional brokerage net trading equity holding company cash nyx position net liquid assets we also monitor alternative funding measures in addition to our available net cash 
the alternative funding measures are significant transactions and actions we could take in the short term to generate cash to meet debt maturities or other business needs 
more precisely  as of december   we have identified the following alternative funding measures to support future debt maturity requirements collect intercompany loan balances  reduction of excess capital at labranche co

based on nyx price of per share on december  after tax proceeds of hedge fund investments following our repurchases of senior and subordinated debt over the past three years  as of december  we maintained our ability to repurchase in whole or in part the remaining senior notes at any time up to the maturity date  in may  without materially impacting the current operations at any of our trading subsidiaries 
on february  the redemption date  we fully redeemed and cancelled all of our remaining outstanding public indebtedness pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing our public debt 
on the redemption date  all of our remaining note holders were paid of the principal amount of their notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the redemption date 
therefore  as of 
table of contents february   we have no remaining outstanding public debt  resulting in a reduction of our interest expense by approximately million per year 
on january   we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing our outstanding public debt by irrevocably depositing with us bank national association the trustee for the indebtedness cash in an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of the redemption price for the senior notes on the redemption date  together with irrevocable instructions from us directing us bank to apply such funds to the payment of the senior notes on the redemption date

such contingencies are considered long term  as there is no present obligation to pay such liabilities in the foreseeable future 
on january   we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock at a price of per share 
the tender offer expired on march  at pm  new york city time 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer  we purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for a total cost of approximately million excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer 
thus  the number of shares we purchased in the tender offer represented approximately of our outstanding common stock  since we had  shares outstanding prior to the commencement of the tender offer following all prior purchases made by us under the prior repurchase program 
as a result of the consummation of the tender offer  approximately million shares of our common stock remained outstanding 
following completion of the tender offer  we have approximately million in board authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program 
repurchases may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  in a tender offer  dutch auction or otherwise  in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws 
the timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors  including price and regulatory requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to regulatory requirements that prescribe communication barriers between our broker dealer subsidiaries  we employ different compliance risk management procedures at each such subsidiary 
these risk processes are set forth below our cash equities dmm risk management process through january  because our cash equities activities on the nyse  prior to the sale of our dmm operations to barclays on january   exposed our capital to significant risks  managing these risks was a constant priority for us 
our central role in the hybrid market helped us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our dmm obligations 
we had developed a risk management process at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary that was designed to balance our ability to profit from our dmm activities with our exposure to potential losses and compliance risk 
this risk management process included participation by our corporate compliance committee  executive operating committee  floor management committee  post managers  floor captains  dmms and chief risk officer 
these parties roles are as follows corporate compliance committee 
labranche co 
llc s corporate compliance committee consisted of representatives from executive and senior management  compliance personnel  including our on floor compliance officer  our general counsel  our chief regulatory officer and several additional senior floor dmms  known as post managers 
the role of the corporate compliance committee was to monitor and report to senior management on the statutory and regulatory compliance efforts of our dmm business 
the corporate compliance committee also advised the compliance department in establishing  reviewing and revising our policies and procedures governing labranche co 
llc s regulatory compliance structure 
executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee was composed of two executive officers 
this committee was responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for our dmm stocks  after receiving recommendations from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviewed all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our nyse floor management committee  at the time of the sale of the dmm business  was composed of three post managers on the nyse floor 
this committee was responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines with the executive operating committee for each of our dmm stocks 
the post managers generally met with their floor captains and the executive operating committee on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular dmm stocks 
we also employed a wheel manager who ensures that the floor is adequately staffed at all times 
in addition  the post managers  the wheel manager and floor captains were always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations 
table of contents reported by a floor captain  and to assist and or provide necessary staff to assist on break out or intense trading situations 
our floor management committee reported to our executive operating committee about each of these trading situations as they occurred 
our floor management committee also trained other dmm and trading assistants on a regular basis on new rules and or interpretations from the nyse with respect to our dmm obligations and guidelines  with the assistance of our compliance department 
the post managers generally met with the dmms on their post at least once a week to evaluate each dmm s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines  as well as to review compliance reports generated by the compliance department in monitoring and reviewing dmm trading activities 
floor captains 
prior to the sale of our dmm business  we employed three floor captains who monitor the activities of our cash equities dmms throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
in addition  the floor captains were readily available to assist our dmms in determining when to deviate from procedures and guidelines in reacting to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the floor captains reported these unusual situations and any deviations from these procedures and guidelines to their respective post managers 
dmms 
prior to the sale of our dmm business  our dmms conducted electronic and  at times  manual trading of our dmm stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  dmms observed our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create and maintain a fair and orderly market 
dmms promptly notified a floor captain or post manager of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines on floor compliance officer 
we had an on floor compliance officer that monitored the dmms compliance with nyse rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reported his findings on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity dmm unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provided summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
in addition  we had at least one trading assistant at each post on the nyse floor who was compliance registered and was able to review trading activities to monitor compliance with rules 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flowed from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
electronic exception reports 
prior to the sale of our dmm business  we had implemented a comprehensive system of electronic rule exception reports at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary to monitor our compliance with nyse and sec rules 
these reports were generated on a daily basis  from one to three days after each trading day  and were the result of significant development efforts from our technology group  with advice of our compliance and legal staff 
our compliance staff reviewed these exception reports daily  and in the event an exception was detected  the exception was researched in detail by our on floor compliance officer or another compliance officer to determine if a compliance issue was found 
if a compliance issue was detected  we made an effort to correct the problem and conduct training of our dmms and or distribute compliance bulletins to ensure our dmms understood the rule and processes going forward 
certain detected issues were discussed at monthly compliance committee meetings 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse had instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules imposed temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels were set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provided investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provided us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market financial risk we had developed a risk management process  which was intended to balance our ability to profit from our equity dmm activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we had invested substantial capital  along with the 
table of contents nyse  in real time  on line systems which gave our management  including our chief risk officer  access to specific trading information during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the dmm s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly sought to manage our trading positions relative to existing market conditions 
prior to the sale of our dmm business  our equity dmm trading activities were subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may have incurred trading losses or gains in our dmm stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our dmm stocks and fulfillment of our dmm obligations 
quantification of such losses or gains were not meaningful as standard market studies do not capture our dmm obligations 
from time to time  we may have had large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities are were marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in an immediate reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
our options  futures and etfs market making risk management process as a market maker in options  etfs and futures through our lsh group of entities  we also trade as principal 
in our market making function  we bring immediacy and liquidity to the markets when we participate 
our market making activities expose us to certain risks  including  but not limited to  price fluctuations and volatility 
in connection with our market making activities  we are engaged in various securities trading and lending activities and assume positions in stocks  rights  options  etfs  us government securities  corporate securities  futures and foreign currencies for which we are exposed to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased  which can be directly impacted by volatile trading on the nyse  the nyse amex and other exchanges 
additionally  in the event of nonperformance and unfavorable market price movements  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at a loss 
we enter into various transactions involving derivatives and off balance sheet financial instruments 
these financial instruments include forwards and foreign exchange contracts  exchange traded and over the counter options  and swaps 
derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes 
our derivatives trading activities exposes us to certain risks  such as price and interest rate fluctuations  volatility risk  credit risk  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
our traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain etf and options positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
certain members of management  including our chief risk officer  who oversee our options  futures and etfs market making activities are responsible for monitoring these risks 
these managers utilize proprietary and third party software applications  as well as information received directly from the traders  to monitor market making positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that our traders operate within the parameters set by management 
furthermore  our aggregate risk in connection with our options  futures and etfs trading is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and our traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
when an unusual or large position is observed by the chief risk officer  he communicates the issue to senior management  who communicate with the trader to understand the strategy and risk management behind the trade and  if necessary  determine avenues to mitigate our risk exposure 
our options  futures and etfs trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  which reduces potential credit risk 

table of contents the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of the options  futures and etfs in our market making portfolios would have impacted profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the underlying securities move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating this risk  and different methodologies would produce materially different estimates 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss our options  futures and etfs market making operations would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk interest rate risk in connection with the trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers in connection with our cash equities market making operations  we are exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies 
thus  a change in a foreign currency exchange rate relative to the us dollar will result in a change in the value of us registered shares in which we are a market maker 
our etf market makers trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency rates 
we  therefore  hold various foreign currencies in order to lessen the risks posed by changing foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  lsp trades derivatives denominated in foreign currencies  which creates exposure to foreign currency risk 
the following chart illustrates how the specified movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar to which our market making activities are exposed would have impacted our profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain assumptions and it does not fully represent the profit and loss exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  security prices  volatility  interest rates and other related factors 
as market makers in options  etfs and futures  we generally maintain large market maker positions 
historically  we have been operating in a low and moderate interest rate market 
as such  we may be sensitive to interest rate increases or decreases and or widening credit spreads may create a less favorable operating environment for this line of business 

table of contents concentration risk we are subject to concentration risk by holding large positions or committing to hold large positions in certain types of securities 
as of december   our largest unhedged proprietary position is our nyx shares 
this concentration does not arise in the normal course of business 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we sold approximately  of our million previously owned nyx shares  leaving us with a position of approximately million nyx shares 
institutional brokerage risk our institutional brokerage segment  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions acting in an agency or principal basis 
the execution of these transactions can result in unrecorded market risk and concentration of credit risk 
our institutional brokerage activities involve execution and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose us to risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and we have to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to significant market risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
institutional brokerage risk management process our institutional brokerage activities require that we execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions  whether due to human error or failure of our information or communication systems  could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or us and could subject us to claims for losses 
we also execute orders as principal in our role as market maker and  at times  to facilitate customer transactions 
to monitor the risk in these positions  we use an internally developed desk top system that is constantly running on the desktop screens of our institutional brokerage firm s senior management  chief compliance officer and trading systems manager 
upon escalation to other members of senior management  research and diligence is performed as to the positions and risk and determinations are made as to how to limit the exposure 
once a position is established  our traders may attempt to manage the risk associated with the position by use of etf strategies  futures on the s p  or with an industry sector comparable security or other method approved by senior management 
despite these risk management efforts  these facilitation positions may result in trading losses that could adversely affect our commission revenues 
our customer margin transactions are cleared through a major wall street firm 
these customer margin transactions are financed by the clearing firm based on our instructions 
we are liable to the clearing firm for any losses incurred by the clearing firm in connection with our customers margin transactions 
our clearing activities  through our outsourced clearing firm  may expose us to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it was necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may have been exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements were not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may have incurred in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to our execution and clearance activities are linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
our largest transactions involved those for institutional customers 
we systematically monitor our open transaction risk in connection with our institutional brokerage activities  starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce risk is taken 
credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the 
table of contents depository trust company dtc or the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  senior management that oversees our institutional brokerage operations  in conjunction with the related compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency  although some of this responsibility now is undertaken by our outsourced clearing firm 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices in our institutional brokerage portfolios would have impacted profits and losses s omitted profit or loss if the underlying securities move portfolio as of march  june  september  december  operational and technology risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss from external events  and from failures in internal processes or information systems 
in each of our business segments  we rely heavily on our information systems in managing our risk 
accordingly  working in conjunction with the nyse and other exchanges  we have made significant investments in our trade processing and execution systems 
our use of  and dependence on  technology has allowed us to sustain our growth over the past several years 
management members and floor captains at our nyse cash equities market making operations constantly monitor our positions and transactions in order to mitigate our risks and identify troublesome trends should they occur 
the substantial capital we had invested  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems affords management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions  the various positions of each of our trading professionals  our overall position in a particular stock  and capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate  per market maker or per issue basis 
our information systems sent and received data from the nyse through dedicated data feeds 
the nyse supplied us with dmm position reporting system terminals both on the trading floor and in our offices 
these terminals allowed us to monitor our nyse dmm trading profits and losses  as well as our positions 
our options  futures and etfs dmm and market making operations utilized proprietary and third party software applications to monitor our positions and profits and losses on a real time basis 
we internally develop and use significant proprietary trading technologies in our market making segment in order to enhance our principal trading capabilities and manage risk in the increasingly evolving electronic marketplace 
our trading technologies are developed and maintained by our information technology personnel and their development process is subject to policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of technology design flaws and programming errors
