item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview growth and development 
americas segment energy from waste projects energy from waste projects have two essential purposes to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects  and to use that waste as a fuel source to generate renewable energy 
the electricity or steam generated by the projects is generally sold to local utilities or industrial customers  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the municipal clients 
these projects are capable of providing waste disposal services and generating electricity or steam  if properly operated and maintained  for several decades 
generally  we provide these waste disposal services and sell the electricity and steam generated under contracts  which expire on various dates between and many of our service contracts may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the municipal client 
for all energy from waste projects  we receive revenue from two primary sources fees charged for operating projects or processing waste received and payments for electricity and steam sales 
we also operate  and in some cases have ownership interests in  transfer stations and landfills which generate revenue from waste and ash disposal fees or operating fees 
in addition  we own and in some cases operate other renewable energy projects in the americas segment which generate electricity from wood waste biomass  landfill gas  and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these other renewable energy projects is sold to utilities under contracts or into the regional power pool at short term rates 
for these projects  we receive revenue from sales of energy  capacity and or cash from equity distributions and additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
we may receive additional revenue from construction activity during periods when we are constructing new facilities or expanding existing facilities 
contract structures we currently operate energy from waste projects in states and one canadian province 
most of our energy from waste projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  many of these projects have common features 
however  each service agreement is different reflecting the specific needs and concerns of a client community  applicable regulatory requirements and other factors 
the following describes features generally common to these agreements  as well as important distinctions among them we design the facility  help to arrange for financing and then we either construct and equip the facility on a fixed price and schedule basis  or we undertake an alternative role  such as construction management  if that better meets the goals of our municipal client 
for the energy from waste projects we own  financing is generally accomplished through tax exempt and taxable revenue bonds issued by or on behalf of the client community 
for these facilities  the bond proceeds are loaned to us to pay for facility construction and to fund a debt service reserve for the project  which is generally sufficient to pay principal and interest for one year 
project related debt is included as project debt and the debt service reserves are included as restricted funds held in trust in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  project debt is secured by the project s revenue  contracts and other assets of our project subsidiary 

table of contents following construction and during operations  we receive revenue from two primary sources fees we receive for operating projects or for processing waste received  and payments we receive for electricity and or steam we sell 
typical features of these agreements are as follows current number of fees for operating projects or for payments for electricity contract types projects processing waste received and or steam we sell service fee we charge a fixed fee which escalates over time pursuant to contractual indices that we believe are appropriate to reflect price inflation for operation and maintenance services provided to these energy from waste projects 
at projects that we own and where project debt is in place  a portion of our fee is dedicated to project debt service 
our contracts at service fee projects provide revenue that does not materially vary based on the amount of waste processed or energy generated and as such is relatively stable for the contract term 
at most of our service fee projects  the operating subsidiary retains only a fraction of the energy revenues generated  with the balance generally used to provide a credit to the municipal client against its disposal costs 
therefore  in these projects  the municipal client derives most of the benefit and risk of energy production and changing energy prices 
tip fee we receive a per ton fee under contracts for processing waste at tip fee projects 
we generally enter into long term waste disposal contracts for a substantial portion of the project s disposal capacity 
these tip fee service agreements include stated fixed fees earned by us for processing waste up to certain base contractual amounts during specified periods 
these tip fee service agreements also set forth the per ton fees that are payable if we accept waste in excess of the base contractual amounts 
the waste disposal and energy revenue from these projects is more dependent upon operating performance and  as such  is subject to greater revenue fluctuation to the extent performance levels fluctuate 
where tip fee structures exist  we generally retain of the energy revenues  as well as risk associated with energy production and changing energy pricing 
the majority of tip fee structures are under long term fixed price energy contracts 
we agree to operate the facility and meet minimum waste processing capacity and efficiency standards  energy production levels and environmental standards 
failure to meet these requirements or satisfy the other material terms of our agreement unless the failure is caused by our client community or by events beyond our control  may result in damages charged to us or  if the breach is substantial  continuing and unremedied  termination of the applicable agreement 
these damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt as reduced by amounts held in trust and or proceeds from sales of facilities securing project debt and as such  these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified 
we have issued performance guarantees to our client communities and  in some cases other parties  which guarantee that our project subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms including  where required  the payment of such damages 
if one or more contracts were terminated for our default  these contractual damages may be material to our cash flow and financial condition 
to date  we have not incurred material liabilities under such performance guarantees 
the client community generally must deliver minimum quantities of municipal solid waste to the facility on a put or pay basis and is obligated to pay a fee for its disposal 
a put or pay commitment means that the client community promises to deliver a stated quantity of waste and pay an agreed amount for its disposal  regardless of whether the full amount of waste is actually delivered 
where a service fee structure exists  portions of the service fee escalate to reflect indices for inflation  and in many cases  the client community must also pay for other costs  such as insurance  taxes  and transportation and disposal of the ash residue to the disposal site 
generally  expenses resulting from the delivery of unacceptable and hazardous waste on the site are also borne by the client community 
in addition  the contracts generally require the client community to pay increased expenses and capital costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances  subject to specified limits 
at three publicly owned facilities we operate  our client community may terminate the operating contract under limited circumstances without cause 
our returns are expected to be stable if we do not incur material unexpected operation and maintenance costs or other expenses 
in addition  most of our energy from waste project contracts are structured so that contract counterparties generally bear  or share in  the costs associated with events or circumstances not within our control  such as uninsured force majeure events and changes in legal requirements 
the stability of our revenues and returns could be affected by our ability to continue to enforce these obligations 
also  at some of our energy from waste facilities  commodity price risk is mitigated by passing through commodity costs to contract counterparties 
with respect to our other renewable energy projects  such structural features generally do not exist because either we operate and maintain such facilities for our own account 

table of contents we receive the majority of our revenue under short and long term contracts  with little or no exposure to price volatility  but with adjustments intended to reflect changes in our costs 
where our revenue is received under other arrangements and depending upon the revenue source  we have varying amounts of exposure to price volatility 
the largest component of our revenue is waste revenue  which has generally been subject to less price volatility than our revenue derived from the sale of energy and metals 
during the second and third quarters of  pricing for energy and recycled metals reached historically high levels and has subsequently declined materially 
at some of our renewable energy projects  our operating subsidiaries purchase fuel in the open markets which exposes us to fuel price risk 
we generally sell the energy output from our projects to local utilities pursuant to long term contracts 
at several of our energy from waste projects  we sell energy output under short term contracts or on a spot basis to our customers 
contracted and merchant capacity our service and waste disposal agreements  as well as our energy contracts  expire at various times 
the extent to which any such expiration will affect us will depend upon a variety of factors  including whether we own the project  market conditions then prevailing  and whether the municipal client exercises options it may have to extend the contract term 
as our contracts expire  we will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  we intend to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate such facilities 
we will also seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as our service and waste disposal agreements at facilities we own or lease begin to expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to us 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
to date  we have been successful in extending our existing contracts to operate energy from waste facilities owned by municipal clients where market conditions and other factors make it attractive for both us and our municipal clients to do so 
see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview growth and development for additional information 
the extent to which additional extensions will be attractive to us and to our municipal clients who own their projects will depend upon the market and other factors noted above 
however  we do not believe that either our success or lack of success in entering into additional negotiated extensions to operate such facilities will have a material impact on our overall cash flow and profitability 
see item a 
risk factors we may face increased risk of market influences on our revenues after our contracts expire 
as we seek to enter into extended or new contracts  we expect that medium and long term contracts for waste supply  at least for a substantial portion of facility capacity  will be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace 
we also expect that medium and long term contracts for sales of energy will be less available than in the past 
as a result  following the expiration of these long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
in conjunction with our energy from waste business  we also own and or operate transfer stations  two ashfills and two landfills in the northeast united states  which we utilize to supplement and manage more efficiently the fuel and ash disposal requirements at our energy from waste operations 
we provide waste procurement services to our waste disposal and transfer facilities which have available capacity to receive waste 
with these services  we seek to maximize our revenue and ensure that our energy from waste facilities are being utilized most efficiently  taking into account maintenance schedules and operating restrictions that may exist from time to time at each facility 
we also provide management and marketing of ferrous and non ferrous metals recovered from energy from waste operations  as well as services related to non hazardous special waste destruction and residue management for our energy from waste projects 
biomass projects we own and operate seven wood fired generation facilities and have a interest in a partnership which owns another wood fired generation facility 
six of these facilities are located in california  and two are located in maine 
the combined gross energy output from these facilities is megawatts mw 
we derive revenue from our biomass facilities from sales of electricity  capacity  and where available  additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
four of these facilities sell their energy output at fixed rates pursuant to contracts  while the other four facilities sell into local power pools at rates that float with the market 
at all of these projects  we purchase fuel pursuant to short term contracts or other arrangements  in each case at prevailing market rates which exposes us to fuel price risk 
the price of fuel varies depending upon the time of year  local supply  and price of energy 
as such  and unlike our energy from waste businesses  we earn income at our biomass facilities 
table of contents based on the margin between our cost of fuel and our revenue from selling the related output 
during part of  this margin was negative at two of our biomass facilities  and we temporarily suspended operations at those locations  and have subsequently entered into favorable long term agreements for the energy output 
we will consider taking similar action in the future if market conditions warrant such action 
in both and  revenue from our biomass projects represented approximately of our americas segment revenue 
other renewable energy projects we also engage in developing  owning and or operating renewable energy production facilities utilizing a variety of energy sources such as water hydroelectric and landfill gas 
we derive our revenues from these facilities primarily from the sale of energy  capacity  and where available  renewable energy credits 
we generally operate and maintain these projects for our own account or we do so on a cost plus basis rather than a fixed fee basis 
hydroelectric we own a equity interest in two small run of river hydroelectric facilities located in the state of washington which sell energy and capacity to puget sound energy under long term energy contracts 
we operate two hydroelectric facilities in costa rica through an operating subsidiary pursuant to long term contracts 
we also have a nominal equity investment in each project 
the electric output from both of these facilities is sold to instituto costarricense de electricidad  a costa rica national electric utility 
landfill gas we own and operate two landfill gas projects located in california and one in massachusetts which produce electricity by combusting methane gas produced in landfills 
these projects sell energy to various utilities 
in both and  revenue from our landfill gas projects was less than of our americas segment revenue 
during  we shut down operations of two landfill gas projects located in california 
upon the expiration of the remaining energy contracts  we expect that these projects will enter into new power off take arrangements or will be shut down

table of contents these facilities use a refuse derived fuel technology 
these facilities sell electricity into the regional power pool at prevailing rates 
these facilities have been designed to export steam for sale 
the project receives waste under an agreement with the greater detroit resource recovery authority gdrra with a term of one year  which renews automatically for successive one year terms unless either party terminates 
in addition  the project may call upon gdrra to deliver the waste of the city of detroit to the detroit facility at market based rates through with respect to this project  we have entered into agreements to expand waste processing capacity from  tpd to  tpd and to increase gross electricity capacity from mw to mw 
the agreements also extend the service contract term by years 
environmental and other project related permits have been received and expansion construction has commenced 
under contracts with the connecticut resource recovery authority  we operate only the boilers and turbines for this facility 
owned by a limited partnership in which the limited partners are not affiliated with us 
we have a ownership interest in this project 
we have nominal ownership interests in these projects 
we have a ownership interest in these projects 
international segment general approach to international projects we have ownership interests in and or operate facilities internationally  including independent power production facilities in the philippines  bangladesh and india where we generate electricity by combusting coal  natural gas and heavy fuel oil  and energy from waste facilities in china and italy 
we are also constructing an energy from waste facility in ireland 
we receive revenue from operating fees  electricity and steam sales  construction activities  and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
the projects sell the electricity and steam they generate under either short term or long term contracts or market concessions to utilities  governmental agencies providing power distribution  creditworthy industrial users  or local governmental units 
energy from waste facilities also sell waste disposal services 
in developing our international business  we have employed the same general approach to projects as is described above with respect to americas segment projects 
we intend to seek to develop or participate in additional international projects  particularly energy from waste projects  where the regulatory or market environment is attractive 
with respect to some international energy from waste projects  ownership transfer to the sponsoring municipality for nominal consideration is required following expiration of the project s long term operating contract 
the ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries potentially entails significant political and financial uncertainties that typically are not encountered in such activities in the united states  as described below and discussed in item a 
risk factors 
some of the countries in which we currently operate are lesser developed countries or developing countries where the political  social and economic conditions are quite different  and are often less stable than those conditions prevailing in the united states or other developed countries 
in order to mitigate these risks both at the outset of project development and over time  we often develop projects jointly with experienced and respected local companies 
when a project is developed  we undertake a credit analysis of the proposed power purchaser and or fuel suppliers which for energy from waste projects are often municipal governments 
we have typically sought to negotiate long term contracts for the supply of fuel with reliable suppliers 
for our projects that are not energy from waste facilities  we have sought  to the extent practicable  to shift the consequences of interruptions in the delivery of fuel whether due to the fault of the fuel supplier or due to reasons beyond the fuel supplier s control to the electricity purchaser or service recipient by securing a suspension of the project s operating responsibilities under the applicable agreements and an extension of our operating concession under such agreements 
in some instances  we require the energy purchaser or service recipient to continue to make payments of fixed costs if such interruptions occur 
in order to mitigate the effect of short term interruptions in the supply of fuel  we have also endeavored to provide on site storage of fuel in sufficient quantities to address such interruptions 
at some of our international independent power projects  our operating subsidiaries purchase fuel in the open market 
however  in most cases  the fuel price risk is borne by the energy purchaser because such risk from changes in fuel prices is passed through under the contract 
in some of our international projects  the project entity has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 

table of contents for our energy from waste projects in international markets  typically a significant portion of each project s waste supply is under long term contracts with sponsoring municipalities  thus reducing the risk of fuel supply interruptions or price instability 
where market conditions are favorable and we have the contractual right to do so  we may also reserve a portion of a facility s capacity for shorter term contracts or receive waste on a spot basis 
for these energy from waste projects  long term contracts for energy output are generally not available  and we expect to sell such output directly into the power pool at market rates  which may fluctuate 
payment for services that we provide will often be made in whole or in part in the domestic currencies of the host countries 
in some of our independent power projects  components of project costs incurred or funded in us dollars are recovered without risk of currency fluctuation through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation  and consequently there is risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
we expect to fund the energy from waste projects that we will develop and own in international markets through a combination of local financings and direct equity investment 
to the extent that the equity investment is made in currencies other than local currency  both the amount of our investment and the returns we receive on that investment may be affected by currency fluctuations 
we have sought to manage and mitigate these risks through all appropriate means  including by developing projects jointly with experienced local partners  where such relationships add value  political and financial analysis of the host countries and the key participants in each project  guarantees of relevant agreements with creditworthy entities  political risk and other forms of insurance  and or participation by united states and or international development finance institutions in the financing of projects 
we determine which mitigation measures to apply based on our ability to balance the risks presented  the availability of such measures and their cost 
we have generally participated in projects which provide services that are treated as a matter of national or key economic importance by the laws and politics of the host country 
therefore  there is a risk that the assets constituting the facilities of these projects could be temporarily or permanently expropriated or nationalized by a host country  made subject to local or national control or be subject to unfavorable legislative action  regulatory decisions or changes in taxation 
we believe that working with experienced and reputable local joint venture partners mitigates this risk 
in certain cases  we have issued guarantees on behalf of our international operating subsidiaries with respect to contractual obligations to operate certain international power projects and energy from waste projects 
the potential damages we may owe under such arrangements may be material 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than our then available sources of funds 
to date  we have not incurred any material liabilities under such guarantees on international projects 
international projects we presently have interests in international power projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately mw gross  with our portion of the ownership in these facilities representing approximately mw 
in addition to our headquarters in fairfield  new jersey  our international business is facilitated through field offices in shanghai  china  chennai  india  dublin  ireland  and birmingham  england

disputing several contractual provisions  tneb has  since  failed to pay the full amount due under the energy contracts for both the samalpatti and madurai projects 
to date  tneb has paid the undisputed portion of its payment obligations approximately of total billings representing each project s operating costs  fuel costs  debt service and some equity return 
similar to many indian state electricity boards  tneb has also failed to fund an escrow account or post a letter of credit required under the project energy contracts  which failure constitutes a default under the project finance documents 
project lenders for both projects have either granted periodic waivers of such default or potential default and or otherwise approved scheduled equity distributions 
neither such default nor potential default in the project financing arrangements constitutes a default under our financing arrangements 
it is possible that the issue of the escrow account and or letter of credit requirement will be resolved as part of the overall negotiation with tneb with respect to the disputed receivables in both projects

table of contents markets  competition and business conditions general business conditions our business can be adversely affected by general economic conditions  war  inflation  adverse competitive conditions  governmental restrictions and controls  changes in laws  natural disasters  energy shortages  fuel costs  weather  the adverse financial condition of customers and suppliers  various technological changes and other factors over which we have no control 
as global populations and consequent economic activity increase  we expect that demand for energy and effective waste management technologies will increase 
we expect this to create generally favorable long term conditions for our existing business and for our efforts to grow our business 
we expect that any cyclical or structural downturns in general economic activity may adversely affect both our existing businesses and our ability to grow through development or acquisitions 
economic conditions affecting business conditions and financial results the ongoing global economic slowdown has reduced demand for goods and services generally  which tends to reduce overall volumes of waste requiring disposal and the pricing at which we can attract waste to fill available capacity 
at the same time  the declines in global natural gas and other fossil fuel prices have pushed electricity and steam pricing lower generally which causes lower revenue for the portion of the energy we sell which is not under fixed price contracts 
lastly  the downturn in economic activity tends to reduce global demand for and pricing of certain commodities  such as the scrap metals we recycle from our energy from waste facilities 
the combined effects of these conditions reduced our revenue and cash flow in many of our customers are municipalities and public authorities  which are generally experiencing fiscal pressure as local and central governments seek to reduce expenses in order to address declining tax revenues which may result from the slowdown and increases in unemployment 
at the same time  continued dislocations in the financial sector may make it more difficult  and more costly  to finance new projects 
these factors  particularly in the absence of energy policies which encourage renewable technologies such as energy from waste  may make it more difficult for us to sell waste disposal services or energy at prices sufficient to allow us to grow our business through developing and building new projects  or through the acquisition of additional businesses 
additional conditions affecting our existing business with respect to our existing waste related businesses  including our energy from waste and waste procurement business  we compete in waste disposal markets  which are highly competitive 
in the united states  the market for waste disposal is almost entirely price driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste sheds 
these factors include regional population and overall waste production rates  the number of other waste disposal sites including principally landfills and transfer stations in existence or in the planning or permitting process  the available disposal capacity in terms of tons of waste per day that can be offered by other regional disposal sites  and the availability and cost of transportation options eg  rail  inter modal  trucking to provide access to more distant disposal sites  thereby affecting the size of the waste shed itself 
in the americas segment waste disposal market  disposal service providers seek to obtain waste supplies for their facilities by competing on disposal price usually on a per ton basis with other disposal service providers 
at our service fee energy from waste facilities  we typically do not compete in this market because we do not have the contractual right to solicit waste 
at these facilities  the client community is responsible for obtaining the waste  if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to us 
at our energy from waste facilities governed by tip fee contracts and at our waste procurement services businesses  we are responsible for obtaining material amounts of waste supply  and therefore  actively compete in these markets to enter into spot  medium and long term contracts 
these energy from waste projects are generally in densely populated areas  with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market 
our waste operations are largely concentrated in the northeastern united states 
see item a 
risk factors our waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines for additional information concerning this geographic concentration 
certain of our competitors in these markets are vertically integrated waste companies which include waste collection operations  and thus have the ability to control supplies of waste which may restrict our ability to offer disposal services at attractive prices 
our business does not include waste collection operations 

table of contents if a long term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community  our percentage of contracted disposal capacity will decrease and we will need to compete in the regional market for waste disposal at the facilities we own 
at that point  we will compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other energy from waste facilities and other waste disposal technologies that are then offering disposal service in the region 
see the discussion above under americas segment contract duration for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
with respect to our sales of electricity and other energy products  we currently sell the majority of our output pursuant to long term contracts  and for this portion of our energy output we do not compete on price 
as these contracts expire  we will sell an increasing portion of our energy output in markets where we will compete on price and  as such  generally expect to have a growing exposure to energy market price volatility 
in certain countries where we are seeking new waste and energy projects  such as china and the united kingdom  we may sell our electricity output pursuant to short term arrangements with local or regional government entities  or directly into the local electricity grid  rather than pursuant to contract 
in these markets  we will have exposure to electricity price fluctuations 
as our existing contracts expire  and as energy prices continue to fluctuate in the united states and other countries  we may sell our output pursuant to short term agreements or directly into regional electricity grids  in which case we would have relatively greater exposure to energy market fluctuations 
see discussion under item a 
risk factors we may face increased risk of market influences on our revenues after our contracts expire for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
we may enter into contractual arrangements that will mitigate our exposure to this volatility through a variety of hedging techniques 
our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce  and will not involve speculative energy trading 
the initial long term contracts we entered into when our energy from waste projects were originally financed will be expiring at various dates through as we seek to enter into extended or new contracts following these expiration dates  we expect that medium and long term contracts for waste supply  for a substantial portion of facility capacity  will be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace 
we also expect that medium and long term contracts for sales of energy will be less available than in the past 
as a result  following the expiration of these initial long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
by  we expect approximately of our energy revenue in the americas segment to be generated by selling energy at market rates unless contractual arrangements we put in place provide otherwise 
additional conditions affecting our growth competition for new contracts and projects is intense in all markets in which we conduct or intend to conduct business  and our businesses are subject to a variety of competitive  regulatory and market influences 
the marketplace in the americas segment for new renewable energy projects  including energy from waste projects  may be affected by the ongoing global economic slowdown  as well as the outcome of current policy debates described below under regulation of business regulations affecting our americas segment recent policy debate regarding climate change and renewable energy 
in order to create new business opportunities and benefits and enhance stockholder value  we are actively engaged in the current discussion among policy makers in the united states regarding the benefits of energy from waste and the reduction of our dependence on landfilling for waste disposal and fossil fuels for energy 
given the ongoing global economic slowdown and related unemployment  policy makers are focused on themes of economic stimulus  job creation  and energy security 
we believe that the construction and permanent jobs created by additional energy from waste development represents the type of green jobs that will be consistent with this focus 
the extent to which we are successful in growing our business will depend in part on our ability to effectively communicate the benefits of energy from waste to public planners seeking waste disposal solutions  and to policy makers seeking to encourage renewable energy technologies and the associated green jobs as viable alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy 
in both our americas and international segments  we may develop or acquire  ourselves or jointly with others  additional waste or energy projects and or businesses 
if we were to do so in a competitive procurement  we would face competition in the selection process from other companies  some of which may have greater financial resources  or more experience in the regional waste and or energy markets 
if we were selected  the amount of market competition we would thereafter face would depend upon the extent to which the revenue at any such project or business would be committed under contract 
if we were to develop or acquire additional projects or businesses not in the context of a competitive procurement  we would face competition in the regional market and compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other energy from waste facilities  other energy producers and other waste disposal or energy generation technologies that are then offering service in the region 
in our international segment  we compete principally for new energy from waste contracts and projects in china and the united kingdom  generally in response to public tenders 
in both of these markets  regulatory conditions are favorable for 
table of contents energy from waste development  and there are numerous local and international companies with whom we compete for such contracts and projects 
if we were to be successful in obtaining such contracts or projects  we expect that a significant portion of each project s waste disposal capacity would be under long term contracts  thus reducing the competition to which we would be subject in waste disposal markets 
once a contract is awarded or a project is financed  our business can be impacted by a variety of risk factors which can affect profitability during the construction period which may extend over several years  depending upon the size and nature of the project  and subsequently over the life of a project 
some of these risks are at least partially within our control  such as successful operation in compliance with laws and the presence or absence of labor difficulties or disturbances 
other risk factors are largely out of our control and may have an adverse impact on a project over a long term 
see item a 
risk factors for more information on these types of risks 
technology  research and development in our energy from waste business  we deploy and operate a diverse number of mass burn waste combustion technologies 
in north america  we have the exclusive right to market the proprietary mass burn combustion technology of martin gmbh fur umwelt und energietechnik  referred to herein as martin 
through our investment in sanfeng  we also have access to certain of martin s mass burn combustion technology in china 
we believe that our know how and worldwide reputation in the field of energy from waste and our know how in designing  constructing and operating energy from waste facilities of a variety of designs and incorporating numerous technologies  rather than the use of a particular technology  are important to our competitive position in the energy from waste industry 
we have pursued  and intend to continue to pursue  opportunities for mass burn combustion and other technologies in all markets  including north america  and will seek to utilize the most appropriate technology for the markets where these opportunities exist and to obtain the necessary technology rights either on an exclusive or project specific basis 
we believe that mass burn combustion technology is now the predominant technology used for the combustion of municipal solid waste in large scale applications 
through facility acquisitions  we own and or operate energy from waste facilities which utilize various technologies from several different vendors  including non martin mass burn combustion technologies and refuse derived fuel technologies which include pre combustion waste processing not required with a mass burn design 
as we continue our efforts to develop and or acquire additional energy from waste projects internationally  we will consider mass burn combustion and other technologies  including technologies other than those offered by martin  which best fit the needs of the local environment of a particular project 
we believe that energy from waste technologies offer an environmentally superior solution to waste disposal and energy challenges faced by leaders around the world  and that our efforts to expand our business will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in such fields as emission controls  residue disposal  alternative waste treatment processes  and combustion controls 
we have advanced our research and development efforts in these areas  and have developed new and cost effective technologies that represented major advances in controlling nitrogen oxide nox emissions 
these technologies  for which patents are pending  have been tested at existing facilities and we are now operating and or installing such systems at several of our facilities 
we also developed and have patents pending for a proprietary process to improve the handling of the residue from our energy from waste facilities 
we have also entered into various agreements with multiple partners to invest in the development  testing or licensing of new technologies related to the transformation of waste materials into renewable fuels or the generation of energy  as well as improved environmental performance 
we intend to maintain a focus on research and development of technologies in these and other areas that we believe will enhance our competitive position  and offer new technical solutions to waste and energy problems that augment and complement our business 
regulation of business regulations affecting our americas segment environmental regulations general our business activities in the united states are pervasively regulated pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws 
federal laws  such as the clean air act and clean water act  and their state counterparts  govern discharges of pollutants to air and water 
other federal  state and local laws comprehensively govern the generation  transportation  storage  treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products such laws and regulations are referred to collectively as the environmental regulatory laws 
other federal  state and local laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  commonly known as cercla and collectively referred to with such other laws as the environmental remediation 
table of contents laws  make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any onsite or offsite environmental contamination which may be associated with our activities and the activities at our sites 
these include landfills we have owned  operated or leased  or at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated  handled or processed by our facilities 
some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination 
some service agreements provide us with indemnification from certain liabilities 
in addition  our landfill gas projects have access rights to landfill sites pursuant to certain leases that permit the installation  operation and maintenance of landfill gas collection systems 
the environmental regulatory laws require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste or renewable energy project  and further require that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility 
we can provide no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re issued  and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays  including delays caused by third party appeals challenging permit issuance 
our failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the environmental regulatory laws can subject us to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental unit  which could include fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation 
see item a 
risk factors compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
to date  we have not incurred material penalties  been required to incur material capital costs or additional expenses  or been subjected to material restrictions on our operations as a result of violations of environmental regulatory laws or permit requirements 
although our operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations  which may result in fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental regulatory laws 
we may be identified  along with other entities  as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to cercla and or analogous state environmental remediation laws 
our ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors  including our volumetric share of waste  the total cost of remediation  and the financial viability of other companies that have also sent waste to a given site and  in the case of divested operations  our contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations 
the environmental regulatory laws may change 
new technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants  for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals  or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal 
thus  as new technology is developed and proven  we may be required to incorporate it into new facilities or make major modifications to existing facilities 
this new technology may be more expensive than the technology we use currently 
environmental regulations recent developments greenhouse gas reporting on september   the environmental protection agency epa issued its final rule on mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases the ghg reporting rule  which requires all energy from waste facilities with ghg emissions greater than  tons carbon dioxide equivalents coe per year to report their ghg emissions from stationary combustion beginning with the reporting year 
all of our energy from waste facilities are expected to exceed this reporting threshold 
certain capital improvements to comply with the ghg reporting rule will be necessary at most of our energy from waste facilities  and we also expect to incur increased operating and maintenance costs  none of which are expected to be material 
we have been voluntarily reporting our ghg emissions under various state and national programs  and do not expect the ghg reporting rule to materially affect our business 
mact rule in  epa issued revisions to the new source performance standards nsps and emission guidelines eg applicable to new and existing municipal waste combustion mwc units the revised mact rule 
the revised mact rule lowered the emission limits for most of the regulated air pollutants emitted by mwcs 
certain capital improvements to comply with revised eg were required and are being implemented at one of our existing energy from waste facilities  which we operate on behalf of a municipality 
most existing facilities also will incur increased operating and maintenance costs to meet the revised eg requirements  none of which are expected to be material 
in  in response to a lawsuit  epa was granted a voluntary remand of the revised mact rule for the purpose of reconsidering the mwc emission limits 
a new rulemaking is expected which may result in more stringent mwc emission limits than are currently included in the revised mact rule  however  pending any such revisions  the requirements and compliance deadlines included in the revised mact rule remain applicable to subject mwcs 
we are not able to predict the timing and potential outcome of any such new rulemaking with respect to mwc emission limits at this time 
revised pm rule in  epa issued a final rule to implement the revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter  or pm revised pm rule 
unlike the revised mact rule discussed above  the revised pm rule is not specific to energy from waste facilities  but instead is a nationwide standard for ambient air quality 
the primary impact of the revised pm rule will be on those areas in certain states that are designated by epa as non attainment with respect to those standards 
epa s revised pm rule will guide state implementation plan sip 
table of contents revisions and could result in more stringent regulation of certain energy from waste facility emissions that already are regulated by the revised mact rule 
in october  epa issued non attainment designations pursuant to the revised pm rule for counties in states  including states in which we operate 
sip revisions to meet the revised pm rule presently are not due until april we are not able to predict the timing and potential outcome of any new pm emission control requirements for mwcs at this time 
the costs to meet new rules for existing facilities owned by municipal clients generally will be borne by the municipal clients 
for projects we own or lease  some municipal clients have the obligation to fund such capital improvements  and at certain of our projects we may be required to fund a portion of the related costs 
in certain cases  we are required to fund the full cost of capital improvements 
we believe that most costs incurred to meet the ghg reporting rule  the revised mact rule and the revised pm rule at facilities we operate may be recovered from municipal clients and other users of our facilities through increased fees permitted to be charged under applicable contracts 
the environmental remediation laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at our municipal solid waste facilities 
the service agreements recognize the potential for inadvertent and improper deliveries of hazardous waste and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility 
under some service agreements  we are responsible for some costs related to hazardous waste deliveries 
we have not incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs to date 
energy regulations our businesses are subject to the provisions of federal  state and local energy laws applicable to the development  ownership and operation of facilities located in the united states 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  among other things  regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the federal power act fpa 
in addition  under existing regulations  ferc determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an exempt wholesale generator ewg  as defined in the public utility holding company act of puhca 
ferc also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a qualifying facility cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non fossil fuel power sources such as waste  which meet certain size and other applicable requirements  referred to as qf  under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
each of our us generating facilities has either been determined by ferc to qualify as a qf or is otherwise exempt  or the subsidiary owning the facility has been determined to be an ewg 
federal power act the fpa gives ferc exclusive rate making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
under the fpa  ferc  with certain exceptions  regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as public utilities 
the fpa also gives ferc jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other activities of public utilities 
our qfs are currently exempt from ferc s rate regulation under sections and of the fpa because i the qf is mw or smaller  ii its sales are made pursuant to a state regulatory authority s implementation of purpa or iii its sales are made pursuant to a contract executed on or before march  under section of the fpa  public utilities are required to obtain ferc s acceptance of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity 
certain of our generating companies in the united states have sales of electricity pursuant to market based rates authorized by ferc 
ferc s orders that grant our generating companies market based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if ferc subsequently determines that we can exercise market power  create barriers to entry  or engage in abusive affiliate transactions 
in addition  amongst other requirements  our market based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules and  if any of our generating companies were deemed to have violated any one of those rules  such generating company would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and or suspension or revocation of their market based rate authority  as well as criminal and civil penalties 
in compliance with section of the energy policy act of epact  ferc has approved the north american electric reliability corporation  or nerc  as the national energy reliability organization  or ero 
as the ero  nerc is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system 
we are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate 
nerc also has the ability to assess financial penalties for non compliance 
in addition to complying with nerc requirements  each of our entities must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability council for the region in which that entity is located 
public utility holding company act of puhca provides ferc with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of ewgs  qfs  and foreign utility companies  as defined in puhca we are a public utility holding company  but because all of our generating facilities have qf status  are otherwise exempt  or are owned through ewgs  we are exempt from the accounting  record retention  and reporting requirements of puhca 
table of contents epact eliminated the limitation on utility ownership of qfs 
over time  this may result in greater utility ownership of qfs and serve to increase competition with our businesses 
epact also extended or established certain renewable energy incentives and tax credits which might be helpful to expand our businesses or for new development 
public utility regulatory policies act purpa was passed in in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers 
purpa created qfs to further both goals  and ferc is primarily charged with administering purpa as it applies to qfs 
ferc has promulgated regulations that exempt qfs from compliance with certain provisions of the fpa  puhca  and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by  or the financial and organizational activities of  electric utilities 
the exemptions afforded by purpa to qfs from regulation under the fpa and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to us and our competitors in the energy from waste and independent power industries 
purpa also initially included a requirement that utilities must buy and sell power to qfs 
among other things  epact eliminated the obligation imposed on utilities to purchase power from qfs at an avoided cost rate where the qf has non discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets having certain characteristics  including nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services 
in addition  ferc has established a regulatory presumption that qfs with a capacity greater than mw have non discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets in most geographic regions in which we operate 
as a result  many of our expansion  renewal and development projects must rely on competitive energy markets rather than purpa s historic avoided cost rates in establishing and maintaining their viability 
existing contracts entered into under purpa are not impacted  but as these contracts expire  a significant and increasing portion of our electricity output will be sold at rates determined through our participation in competitive energy markets 
recent policy debate regarding climate change and renewable energy increased public and political debate has occurred recently over the need for additional regulation of ghg emissions principally carbon dioxide co and methane as a contributor to climate change 
such regulations could in the future affect our business 
as is the case with all combustion  our facilities do emit co  however we believe that energy from waste creates net reductions in ghg emissions and is otherwise environmentally beneficial  because it avoids co emissions from fossil fuel power plants  avoids methane emissions from landfills  avoids habitat destruction and contamination from landfilling  and avoids ghg emissions from mining and processing metal because it recovers and recycles scrap metals from waste 
in addition  energy from waste facilities typically are located close to the source of the waste and thus typically reduce fossil fuel consumption and air emissions associated with long haul transportation of waste to landfills 
for policy makers at the local level who make decisions on waste disposal alternatives  we believe that using energy from waste instead of landfilling will result in significantly lower net ghg emissions  while also introducing more control over the cost of waste disposal and supply of local electrical power 
we are actively engaged in encouraging policy makers at state and federal levels to enact legislation that supports energy from waste as a superior choice for communities to avoid both the environmental harm caused by landfilling waste  and reduce local reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy 
the united states congress is currently debating proposals designed to encourage two broad policy objectives increased renewable energy generation and the reduction of fossil fuel usage and related ghg emissions 
the united states house of representatives passed a bill known as the american clean energy and security act of aces which addresses both policy objectives  by means of a phased in national renewable energy standard and a cap and trade system with a market based emissions trading system aimed at reducing emissions of co below baseline levels 
energy from waste and biomass have generally been included in the aces bill to be among technologies that help to achieve both of these policy objectives 
similar legislation has been introduced in the united states senate 
while legislation is far from final and a vigorous debate is expected when the house of representatives and senate bills are reconciled  we believe the direction of congressional efforts could create additional growth opportunities for our business and increase energy revenue from existing facilities 
congress is expected to continue to debate energy policy as a priority and ultimately enact some form of legislation regarding the need to encourage renewable electricity generation 
given the ongoing global economic slowdown and related unemployment  policy makers are also expected to focus on economic stimulus  job creation  and energy security 
we believe that the construction and permanent jobs created by additional energy from waste development represents the type of green jobs that will be consistent with this focus 
many of these same policy considerations apply equally to other renewable technologies  especially with respect to our biomass business 
the extent to which such potential legislation and policy initiatives will affect our business will depend in 
table of contents part on whether energy from waste and our other renewable technologies are included within the range of renewable technologies that could benefit from such legislation 
concurrent with the federal legislative activity noted above  the epa is continuing to move forward with its regulation of ghgs under the clean air act caa 
during  the epa issued its finding that current and projected concentrations of ghgs threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
in addition  the epa proposed the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  designed to limit regulation of ghgs under the caa to large facilities 
both actions set the stage for the epa to issue ghg emission requirements for light duty vehicles  expected in when finalized  this regulation will set in motion the addition of ghgs to new and revised facility title v operating permits  including those applicable to our facilities 
we cannot predict at this time the potential impact to our business of the epa s regulatory initiatives under the caa regarding  or whether the epa s regulation will be impacted or superseded by any future climate change legislation 
we continue to closely follow developments in this area 
while the political discussion in congress  as well as at the state and regional levels  has not been aimed specifically at waste or energy from waste businesses  regulatory initiatives developed to date have been broad in scope and designed generally to promote renewable energy  develop a certified ghg inventory  and ultimately reduce ghg emissions 
many of these more developed initiatives have been at the state or regional levels  and some initiatives exist in regions where we have projects 
for example  during  a group of seven northeastern states  including connecticut  new jersey and new york  acting through the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi  issued a model rule to implement reductions in ghg emissions 
the rggi model rule also featured a cap and trade program for regional co emissions  initially fixed at levels  followed by incremental reductions below those levels after to date  rggi has been focused on fossil fuel fired electric generators and does not directly affect energy from waste facilities  however  we continue to monitor developments with respect to state implementation of rggi 
efforts also are underway  through the western climate initiative wci  to devise a model rule for ghg emission reductions  including mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and a regional cap and trade program 
the wci would operate in seven western states and four canadian provinces  including california  oregon and british columbia  where we operate energy from waste facilities 
unlike rggi  wci is not limited in scope to fossil electric generation and may subject our energy from waste facilities in covered states to additional regulatory requirements  although we cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking at this time 
we continue to monitor developments with respect to the developing wci and intend to participate in the rulemaking process 
we expect that initiatives intended to reduce ghg emissions  such as rggi  wci and any federal legislation that would impose similar cap and trade programs  may cause electricity prices to rise  thus potentially affecting the prices at which we sell electricity from our facilities which sell into the market 
regulations affecting our international segment we have ownership and operating interests in energy generation facilities outside the americas 
most countries have expansive systems for the regulation of the energy business 
these generally include provisions relating to ownership  licensing  rate setting and financing of generation and transmission facilities 
we provide waste and energy services through environmentally protective project designs  regardless of the location of a particular project 
compliance with environmental standards comparable to those of the united states are often conditions to credit agreements by multilateral banking agencies  as well as other lenders or credit providers 
the laws of various countries include pervasive regulation of emissions into the environment and provide governmental entities with the authority to impose sanctions for violations  although these requirements are generally different from those applicable in the united states 
see item a 
risk factors exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our international businesses and compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
climate change policies certain international markets in which we compete have recently adopted regulatory or policy frameworks that encourage energy from waste projects as important components of ghg emission reduction strategies  as well as waste management planning and practice 
the european union the european union has adopted regulations which require member states to reduce the utilization of and reliance upon landfill disposal 
the legislation emanating from the european union is primarily in the form of directives  which are of direct effect within the member state but need enabling legislation to implement the practical implications of them  which 
table of contents can result in significant variance between the legislative schemes introduced by member states 
certain directives notably affect the regulation of energy from waste facilities across the european union 
these include directive ec concerning integrated pollution prevention and control known as the ippc directive which governs emissions to air  land and water from certain large industrial installations  directive ec concerning the landfill of waste known as the landfill directive which imposes operational and technical controls on landfills and restricts  on a reducing scale to the year  the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which member countries may dispose of in a landfill  and directive ec concerning the incineration of waste known as the waste incineration directive or wid  which imposes limits on emissions to air from the incineration and co incineration of waste 
the united kingdom and ireland  the two primary european union member states in which we currently compete  are both subject to the directives above 
in response to these directives and in furtherance of its policies to reduce ghg emissions  the united kingdom now imposes taxes on landfilling of waste ton in the tax year  increasing annually by ton to ton in in addition  each waste disposal authority in the united kingdom is limited in the amount of biodegradable waste it may landfill each year by the landfill directive 
this has been implemented in england by the landfill allowance trading scheme known as lats 
lats is structured as a cap and trade program which reduces the capped amount of waste that can be landfilled each year through when capped amounts will be fixed at of levels 
lats allowances are tradable with other waste disposal authorities and substantial penalties are levied against authorities not in compliance 
wales  scotland and northern ireland have different implementation schemes that rely on the imposition of direct fines if landfill allowances are exceeded 
energy from waste facilities in the united kingdom with combined heat and power may also be eligible for various green certificates which are designed to promote the contribution of renewable sources to electricity production 
these include renewables obligation certificates  which are tradable certificates issued in respect of eligible renewable source electricity generated within the united kingdom and supplied to customers in the united kingdom by a licensed supplier  tradable levy exemption certificates  which exempt the holder from the united kingdom climate change levy  and renewable energy guarantees of origin regos  which constitute evidence that electricity was generated from a renewable source 
similarly in ireland  the obligation to divert biodegradable waste from landfill  in accordance with the landfill directive  has led to policies that promote energy from waste facilities over landfill  including a per ton landfill levy that is soon expected to be increased and proposed conditions in the operating permits for landfilling that  when adopted  will restrict disposal to landfills of this source of ghg 
in addition  the biodegradable fraction of waste treated in energy from waste facilities in ireland is eligible for renewable support designed to enable ireland to meet its targets under directives ec of of gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in and government targets of of electricity consumption from renewable sources by the renewable energy feed in tariff refit scheme launched in and extended in also supports the construction of renewable generation from  amongst other things  biomass 
energy from waste facilities may also be eligible for regos in respect of the energy generated from the biodegradable fraction of the waste that is thermally treated in ireland  although the extent to which regos will be tradable is not yet determined 
china china currently has a favorable regulatory environment for the development of energy from waste projects 
the ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china has set a goal to increase the volume of waste disposed of by energy from waste facilities from estimate to by the chinese central government has further called for an increase in energy from waste output generation from mw estimate to mw by the end of  and to three gigawatts by energy from waste and municipal waste disposal services are designated by the chinese central government as encouraged industries for foreign investment 
china also has various promotional laws and policies in place to promote energy from waste and municipal waste disposal projects including exemptions and reductions of corporate income tax  value added tax refunds  prioritized commercial bank loans  state subsidies for loan interest  and a guaranteed subsidized price for the sale of electricity

risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in public policies and legislative initiatives could materially affect our business and prospects 
there has been substantial debate recently in the united states and abroad in the context of environmental and energy policies affecting climate change  the outcome of which could have a positive or negative influence on our existing business and our prospects for growing our business 
the united states congress has recently considered the enactment of laws that would encourage electricity generation from renewable technologies and discourage such generation from fossil fuels 
congress has considered proposed legislation which would have established new renewable portfolio standards which are designed to increase the proportion of the nation s electricity that is generated from renewable technologies 
congress has also considered enacting legislation which sets declining limits on greenhouse gas emissions  and requires generators to purchase rights to emit in excess of such limits  and allows such rights to be traded 
this structure is sometimes referred to as cap and trade 
in addition  congress has periodically considered extending existing tax benefits to renewable energy technologies  which would expire without such an extension 
each of these policy initiatives  and potentially others that may be considered  could provide material financial and competitive benefits to those technologies which are included among those defined as renewable in any legislation that is enacted  or are otherwise favorably treated as greenhouse gas reducing technologies in cap and trade legislation 
for those sources of greenhouse gas emissions that are unable to meet the required limitations  such legislation could impose substantial financial burdens 
our business could be adversely affected if renewable technologies we use were not included among those technologies identified in any final law as being renewable and or greenhouse gas reducing  and therefore entitled to the benefits of such laws 
weakness in the economy may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow 
the ongoing global economic slowdown has reduced demand for goods and services generally  which tends to reduce overall volumes of waste requiring disposal  and the pricing at which we can attract waste to fill available capacity 
at the same time  the recent decline in global oil and natural gas prices has pushed energy pricing lower generally  and may reduce the prices for the portion of the energy we sell under short term arrangements 
lastly  the downturn in economic activity tends to reduce global demand for and pricing of certain commodities  such as the scrap metals we recycle from our energy from waste facilities 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow  and may not be successfully mitigated or reduced by the efforts of governments to stimulate economic activity 
weakness in the economy may have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
the same economic slowdown may reduce the demand for the waste disposal services and the energy that our facilities offer 
many of our customers are municipalities and public authorities  which are generally experiencing fiscal pressure as local and central governments seek to reduce expenses in order to address declining tax revenues  which may result from the ongoing global economic slowdown and increases in unemployment 
these factors  particularly in the absence of energy policies which encourage renewable technologies such as energy from waste  may make it more difficult for us to sell waste disposal services or energy at prices sufficient to allow us to grow our business through developing and building new projects 
we may face increased risk of market influences on our revenues after our contracts expire 
the contracts pursuant to which we operate energy from waste projects and sell energy output expire on various dates between and expiration of these contracts will subject us to greater market risk in entering into new or replacement contracts at pricing levels which will generate comparable or enhanced revenues 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into renewal or replacement contracts on favorable terms  or at all 
the expiration of existing energy sales contracts  if not renewed  will require us to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
we may face risk of revenue and cash flow loss if we are not successful in extending or renewing our contracts to operate facilities which we do not own 
we operate facilities for municipal clients  under long term contracts and we have historically been successful extending such contracts 
if in the future when existing contracts expire  we are unable to reach agreement with our municipal clients on the terms under which they would extend our operating contracts  this may adversely affect our revenue  cash flow and profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such contracts or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to us 

table of contents recent dislocations in credit and capital markets may make it more difficult for us to borrow money or raise capital needed to finance the construction of new projects  the expansion of our existing projects  and the acquisitions of certain businesses 
our business is capital intensive  and we typically borrow money from project lenders to pay for a portion of the cost to construct facilities 
recent dislocations in the credit markets  including for project debt  have resulted in less credit being made available by banks and other lending institutions  and or borrowing terms that are less favorable than has historically been the case 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain financing for new facilities or expansions of our existing facilities  on terms  and or for a cost  that we find acceptable  which may make it more difficult to grow our business through new and or expanded facilities 
we also intend to grow our business through opportunistic acquisitions of projects or businesses 
some acquisitions may be large enough to require capital in excess of our cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility 
recent dislocations in the capital markets may adversely impact our access to debt or equity capital  and our ability to execute our strategy to grow our business through such acquisitions 
recent dislocations in the credit and capital markets  if prolonged and severe  could make it more difficult or costly for us to refinance our corporate debt when it matures 
a substantial portion of our debt will need to be refinanced between and prolonged instability or worsening of the credit or capital markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain refinancing of such debt on favorable terms  or at all 
such circumstances could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and or the share price of our common stock 
our reputation could be adversely affected if opposition to our efforts to grow our business results in adverse publicity 
with respect to our efforts to grow and maintain our business globally  we sometimes experience opposition from advocacy groups or others intended to halt development or on going business 
such opposition is often intended to discourage third parties from doing business with us and may be based on misleading  inaccurate  incomplete or inflammatory assertions 
our reputation may be adversely affected as a result of adverse publicity resulting from such opposition 
such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow and maintain our business 
changes in technology may have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to dispose of waste  produce by products from waste  or to produce power 
we and many other companies are pursuing these technologies  and an increasing amount of capital is being invested to find new approaches to waste disposal  waste treatment  and renewable power generation 
it is possible that this deployment of capital may lead to advances in these or other technologies which will reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production to a level below our costs and or provide new or alternative methods of waste disposal or energy generation that become more accepted than those we currently utilize 
unless we are able to participate in these advances  any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and the value of our existing facilities 
operation of our facilities involves significant risks 
the operation of our facilities involves many risks  including the inaccuracy of our assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of anticipated revenues  supply interruptions  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  difficulty or inability to find suitable replacement parts for equipment  increases in the prices of commodities we need to continue operating our facilities  the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste or fuel  fluctuations in the heating value of the waste we use for fuel at our energy from waste facilities  decreases in the fees for solid waste disposal and electricity generated  decreases in the demand or market prices for recovered ferrous or non ferrous metal  disruption in the transmission of electricity generated  permitting and other regulatory issues  license revocation and changes in legal requirements  labor disputes and work stoppages  unforeseen engineering and environmental problems  unanticipated cost overruns  
table of contents weather interferences  catastrophic events including fires  explosions  earthquakes  droughts and acts of terrorism  the exercise of the power of eminent domain  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
we cannot predict the impact of these risks on our business or operations 
these risks  if they were to occur  could prevent us from meeting our obligations under our operating contracts and have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
development and construction of new projects and expansions may not commence as anticipated  or at all 
the development and construction of new waste and energy facilities involves many risks including difficulties in identifying  obtaining and permitting suitable sites for new projects  the inaccuracy of our assumptions with respect to the cost of and schedule for completing construction  difficulty  delays or inability to obtain financing for a project on acceptable terms  delays in deliveries of  or increases in the prices of  equipment sourced from other countries  the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste or other fuels for startup  permitting and other regulatory issues  license revocation and changes in legal requirements  labor disputes and work stoppages  unforeseen engineering and environmental problems  unanticipated cost overruns  and weather interferences  catastrophic events including fires  explosions  earthquakes  droughts and acts of terrorism 
in addition  new facilities have no operating history and may employ recently developed technology and equipment 
our businesses maintain insurance to protect against risks relating to the construction of new projects  however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  a new facility may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may operate at a loss 
in certain situations  if a facility fails to achieve commercial operation  at certain levels or at all  termination rights in the agreements governing the facility s financing may be triggered  rendering all of the facility s debt immediately due and payable 
as a result  the facility may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the facility 
construction activities may cost more and take longer than we estimate 
the design and construction of new projects or expansions requires us to contract for services from engineering and construction firms  and make substantial purchases of equipment such as boilers  turbine generators and other components that require large quantities of steel to fabricate 
world wide demand for new infrastructure spending  including energy generating facilities and waste disposal facilities  continues to increase  and prices for building materials such as steel may also rise sharply 
in addition  this increased demand affects not only the cost of obtaining the services necessary to design and construct these facilities  but also the availability of quality firms to perform the services 
these conditions may adversely affect our ability to successfully compete for new projects  or construct and complete such projects on time and within budget 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may affect our results from operations or construction costs of facilities we develop in international markets 
we have sought to participate in projects where the host country has allowed the convertibility of its currency into us dollars and repatriation of earnings  capital and profits subject to compliance with local regulatory requirements 
as we grow our business in other countries and enter new international markets  we expect to invest substantial amounts in foreign currencies to pay for the construction costs of facilities we develop  or for the cost to acquire existing businesses or assets 
currency volatility in those markets  as well as the effectiveness of any currency hedging strategies we may implement  may impact the amount we are required to invest in new projects  as well as our reported results 
in some cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in us dollars are recovered with limited exposure to currency fluctuations through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation 
as a result  there is a risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
changes in labor laws could adversely affect our relationship with our employees and cause disruptions to our business 
legislation has been proposed in congress which would materially change the labor laws in the united states 
the proposed changes would  among other things  allow labor unions to organize employees without secret ballot employee 
table of contents protections  require arbitrator imposed contracts in the event good faith bargaining was not successful within short time periods  and impose significant fines on employers under certain circumstances 
our business depends upon the professionalism  innovation  and hard work of our employees and our ability to maintain a safe workplace where employees are treated fairly  with respect  and where we have the flexibility to make operating decisions 
we believe our success may be affected by the degree to which we are able to maintain a direct relationship with our employees without the imposition of third party representatives  such as labor unions 
we cannot predict if such legislation will be enacted in its present form or whether and to what extent it may affect our relationship with our employees  the cost of operating our facilities and our operating discretion 
the rapid growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth and intend to further grow our business 
this growth has placed  and potential future growth will continue to place  a strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
our ability to successfully offer services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continually evaluate and maintain our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to expand  train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to expand in any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth and current operation of our business as a whole 
our efforts to grow our business will require us to incur significant costs in business development  often over extended periods of time  with no guarantee of success 
our efforts to grow our waste and energy services business will depend in part on how successful we are in developing new projects and expanding existing projects 
the development period for each project may occur over several years  during which we incur substantial expenses relating to siting  design  permitting  community relations  financing and professional fees associated with all of the foregoing 
not all of our development efforts will be successful  and we may decide to cease developing a project for a variety of reasons 
if the cessation of our development efforts were to occur at an advanced stage of development  we may have incurred a material amount of expenses for which we will realize no return 
our insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
although our businesses maintain insurance  obtain warranties from vendors  require contractors to meet certain performance levels and  in some cases  pass risks we cannot control to the service recipient or output purchaser  the proceeds of such insurance  warranties  performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
performance reductions could materially and adversely affect us and our projects may operate at lower levels than expected 
most service agreements for our energy from waste facilities provide for limitations on damages and cross indemnities among the parties for damages that such parties may incur in connection with their performance under the service agreement 
in most cases  such contractual provisions excuse our businesses from performance obligations to the extent affected by uncontrollable circumstances and provide for service fee adjustments if uncontrollable circumstances increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will prevent our businesses from incurring losses upon the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances or that if our businesses were to incur such losses they would continue to be able to service their debt 
we have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations associated with our energy from waste facilities 
with respect to our businesses  we have issued guarantees to our municipal clients and other parties that we will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
the obligations guaranteed will depend upon the contract involved 
many of our subsidiaries have contracts to operate and maintain energy from waste facilities 
in these contracts  the subsidiary typically commits to operate and maintain the facility in compliance with legal requirements  to accept minimum amounts of solid waste  to generate a minimum amount of electricity per ton of waste  and to pay damages to contract counterparties under specified circumstances  including those where the operating subsidiary s contract has been terminated for default 
any contractual damages or other obligations incurred by us could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on our owned energy from waste facilities could expose us to recourse liability on project debt 
certain of our operating subsidiaries which have issued these guarantees may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay 
table of contents such damages or other obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to avoid incurring material payment obligations under such guarantees or that  if we did incur such obligations  that we would have the cash resources to pay them 
our businesses generate their revenue primarily under long term contracts and must avoid defaults under those contracts in order to service their debt and avoid material liability to contract counterparties 
we must satisfy performance and other obligations under contracts governing energy from waste facilities 
these contracts typically require us to meet certain performance criteria relating to amounts of waste processed  energy generation rates per ton of waste processed  residue quantity and environmental standards 
our failure to satisfy these criteria may subject us to termination of operating contracts 
if such a termination were to occur  we would lose the cash flow related to the projects and incur material termination damage liability  which may be guaranteed by us 
in circumstances where the contract has been terminated due to our default  we may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to perform our respective obligations under such contracts in order to avoid such contract terminations  or damages related to any such contract termination  or that if we could not avoid such terminations that we would have the cash resources to pay amounts that may then become due 
we have provided guarantees and financial support in connection with our projects 
we are obligated to guarantee or provide financial support for our projects in one or more of the following forms support agreements in connection with service or operating agreement related obligations  direct guarantees of certain debt relating to our facilities  contingent obligations to pay lease payment installments in connection with certain of our facilities  agreements to arrange financing for projects under development  contingent credit support for damages arising from performance failures  environmental indemnities  and contingent capital and credit support to finance costs  in most cases in connection with a corresponding increase in service fees  relating to uncontrollable circumstances 
many of these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified  but  if we were required to provide this support  it may be material to our cash flow and financial condition 
our businesses depend on performance by third parties under contractual arrangements 
our waste and energy services businesses depend on a limited number of third parties to  among other things  purchase the electric and steam energy produced by our facilities  and supply and deliver the waste and other goods and services necessary for the operation of our energy facilities 
the viability of our facilities depends significantly upon the performance by third parties in accordance with long term contracts  and such performance depends on factors which may be beyond our control 
if those third parties do not perform their obligations  or are excused from performing their obligations because of nonperformance by our waste and energy services businesses or other parties to the contracts  or due to force majeure events or changes in laws or regulations  our businesses may not be able to secure alternate arrangements on substantially the same terms  if at all  for the services provided under the contracts 
in addition  the bankruptcy or insolvency of a participant or third party in our facilities could result in nonpayment or nonperformance of that party s obligations to us 
many of these third parties are municipalities and public authorities 
the ongoing global economic slowdown and disruptions in credit markets have strained resources of these entities generally  and could make it difficult for these entities to honor their obligations to us 
we are subject to counterparty and market risk with respect to transactions with financial and other institutions 
recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions 
the option counterparties to our cash convertible note hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions  and we are subject to risks that these option counterparties default under these transactions 
our exposure to counterparty credit risk is not secured by any collateral 
if one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our cash convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 
our exposure will depend on many factors but  generally  the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in volatility of our stock 
we may also suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of a default by one of the option counterparties 
in addition  a default by an option counterparty may result in our inability to repay the cash convertible senior notes as 
table of contents a result of the negative covenants in our credit agreement or otherwise 
we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties 
we also have a revolving credit facility  a funded letter of credit facility  and term loan with a diversified group of financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these financial and other institutions and their ability to fund their obligation when required under our agreements 
we also expect that medium and long term contracts for sales of energy will be less available than in the past 
as a result  following the expiration of our initial long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
consequently  we may enter into futures  forward contracts  swaps or options with financial institutions to hedge our exposure to market risk in energy markets 
we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these financial and other institutions 
concentration of suppliers and customers may expose us to heightened financial exposure 
our waste and energy services businesses often rely on single suppliers and single customers at our facilities  exposing such facilities to financial risks if any supplier or customer should fail to perform its obligations 
for example  our businesses often rely on a single supplier to provide waste  fuel  water and other services required to operate a facility and on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility s output 
in most cases our businesses have long term agreements with such suppliers and customers in order to mitigate the risk of supply interruption 
the financial performance of these facilities depends on such customers and suppliers continuing to perform their obligations under their long term agreements 
a facility s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any one customer or supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers or suppliers to produce the same level of profitability 
we cannot assure you that such performance failures by third parties will not occur  or that if they do occur  such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability of our businesses 
in addition  we rely on the municipal clients as a source not only of waste for fuel  but also of revenue from the fees for disposal services we provide 
because our contracts with municipal clients are generally long term  we may be adversely affected if the credit quality of one or more of our municipal clients were to decline materially 
our waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines 
the majority of our waste disposal facilities are located in the northeastern united states  primarily along the washington  dc to boston  massachusetts corridor 
adverse economic developments in this region could affect regional waste generation rates and demand for waste disposal services provided by us 
adverse market developments caused by additional waste disposal capacity in this region could adversely affect waste disposal pricing 
either of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cash generation 
some of our energy contracts involve greater risk of exposure to performance levels which could result in materially lower revenues 
some of our energy from waste facilities receive of the energy revenues they generate 
as a result  if we are unable to operate these facilities at their historical performance levels for any reason  our revenues from energy sales could materially decrease 
exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our international businesses 
our international operations expose us to political  legal  tax  currency  inflation  convertibility and repatriation risks  as well as potential constraints on the development and operation of potential business  any of which can limit the benefits to us of an international project 
our projected cash distributions from most of our existing international facilities come from facilities located in countries with sovereign ratings below investment grade 
the financing  development and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks  which vary by country  including changes in law or regulations  changes in electricity pricing  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations  changes in united states federal  state and local laws  including tax laws  related to foreign operations  compliance with united states federal  state and local foreign corrupt practices laws  changes in government policies or personnel  
table of contents changes in general economic conditions affecting each country  including conditions in financial markets  changes in labor relations in operations outside the united states  political  economic or military instability and civil unrest  expropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities  and credit quality of entities that purchase our power 
the legal and financial environment in foreign countries in which we currently own assets or projects could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects 
any or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation 
as a result  these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses  or third parties with whom we have a relationship  were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 
some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy to a greater extent than in the united states 
it is our policy to comply  and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply  with all applicable anti bribery laws  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate 
our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws 
such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
exposure to fuel supply prices may affect our costs and results of operations 
changes in the market prices and availability of fuel supplies to generate electricity may increase our cost of producing power  which could adversely impact our energy businesses profitability and financial performance 
the market prices and availability of fuel supplies fluctuate for some of our international facilities  and for our biomass facilities 
any price increase  delivery disruption or reduction in the availability of such supplies could affect our ability to operate the facilities and impair their cash flow and profitability 
we may be subject to further exposure if any of our future international operations are concentrated in facilities using fuel types subject to fluctuating market prices and availability 
we may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate our exposure to supply and price swings 
our inability to obtain resources for operations may adversely affect our ability to effectively compete 
our energy from waste facilities depend on solid waste for fuel  which provides a source of revenue 
for most of our facilities  the prices we charge for disposal of solid waste are fixed under long term contracts and the supply is guaranteed by sponsoring municipalities 
however  for some of our energy from waste facilities  the availability of solid waste to us  as well as the tipping fee that we must charge to attract solid waste to our facilities  depends upon competition from a number of sources such as other energy from waste facilities  landfills and transfer stations competing for waste in the market area 
in addition  we may need to obtain waste on a competitive basis as our long term contracts expire at our owned facilities 
there has been consolidation and there may be further consolidation in the solid waste industry which would reduce the number of solid waste collectors or haulers that are competing for disposal facilities or enable such collectors or haulers to use wholesale purchasing to negotiate favorable below market disposal rates 
the consolidation in the solid waste industry has resulted in companies with vertically integrated collection activities and disposal facilities 
such consolidation may result in economies of scale for those companies as well as the use of disposal capacity at facilities owned by such companies or by affiliated companies 
such activities can affect both the availability of waste to us for disposal at some of our energy from waste facilities and market pricing 
compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
costs of compliance with federal  state  local and foreign existing and future environmental regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
our waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities  primarily relating to air  waste including residual ash from combustion and water 
we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in operating our facilities 
our businesses may incur significant additional costs to comply with these requirements 
environmental regulations may also limit our ability to operate our facilities at maximum capacity or at all 
if our businesses fail to comply with these requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability  damages and fines 
existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
this may materially 
table of contents increase the amount we must invest to bring our facilities into compliance  impose additional expense on our operations  or otherwise impose structural changes to markets which would adversely affect our competitive positioning in those markets 
in addition  lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal  state and or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs 
stricter environmental regulation of air emissions  solid waste handling or combustion  residual ash handling and disposal  and waste water discharge could materially affect our cash flow and profitability 
certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused 
although we seek to obtain indemnities against liabilities relating to historical contamination at the facilities we own or operate  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination  including contamination we did not cause 
our businesses may not be able to obtain or maintain  from time to time  all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them  the operation of our facilities could be jeopardized or become subject to additional costs 
energy regulation could adversely affect our revenues and costs of operations 
our waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive energy regulations by federal  state and foreign authorities 
we cannot predict whether the federal  state or foreign governments will modify or adopt new legislation or regulations relating to the solid waste or energy industries 
the economics  including the costs  of operating our facilities may be adversely affected by any changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation or any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements 
the federal power act fpa regulates energy generating companies and their subsidiaries and places constraints on the conduct of their business 
the fpa regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities 
under the public utility regulatory policies act of  our facilities located in the united states are exempt from most provisions of the fpa and state rate regulation 
our foreign projects are also exempt from regulation under the fpa 
the energy policy act of enacted comprehensive changes to the energy industry in the united states which may affect our businesses 
the energy policy act removed certain regulatory constraints that previously limited the ability of utilities and utility holding companies to invest in certain activities and businesses  which may have the effect over time of increasing competition in energy markets in which we participate 
in addition  the energy policy act includes provisions that may remove some of the benefits provided to non utility electricity generators  like us  after our existing energy sale contracts expire 
as a result  we may face increased competition after such expirations occur 
if our businesses lose existing exemptions under the fpa  the economics and operations of our energy projects could be adversely affected  including as a result of rate regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission with respect to our output of electricity  which could result in lower prices for sales of electricity 
in addition  depending on the terms of the project s power purchase agreement  a loss of our exemptions could allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity under existing contracts 
such results could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project and could trigger defaults under provisions of the applicable project contracts and financing agreements 
defaults under such financing agreements could render the underlying debt immediately due and payable 
under such circumstances  we cannot assure you that revenues received  the costs incurred  or both  in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our operations 
our waste and energy services businesses are continually in the process of obtaining or renewing federal  state  local and foreign approvals required to operate our facilities 
while we believe our businesses currently have all necessary operating approvals  we may not always be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals  and we may not be able to obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or maintain all required regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals  the operation of our facilities or the sale of electricity to third parties could be prevented  made subject to additional regulation or subject our businesses to additional costs or a decrease in revenue 
the energy industry is becoming increasingly competitive  and we might not successfully respond to these changes 
we may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the changes resulting in increased competition in the energy industry in global markets 
these changes may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets  
table of contents privatization of the electric utility industry in other markets and increasing competition in all markets 
to the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of our business may be subject to greater volatility 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness 
the level of our consolidated indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness under our credit facilities  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industries in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our consolidated debt  and the price of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our indebtedness 
our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash and our ability to receive dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries in the future 
this  in turn  is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the following the continued operation and maintenance of our facilities  consistent with historical performance levels  maintenance or enhancement of revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities  market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing  as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals  expansions and additional contracts  particularly after our existing contracts expire  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition 
our credit facilities contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions and covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests 
complying with these covenant restrictions may have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition by limiting our ability to engage in certain transactions or activities  including incurring additional indebtedness or issuing guarantees  in excess of specified amounts  creating liens  in excess of specified amounts  making certain investments  in excess of specified amounts  entering into transactions with our affiliates  selling certain assets  in excess of specified amounts  making cash distributions or paying dividends to us  in excess of specified amounts  redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments to us  in excess of specified amounts  and merging or consolidating with any person 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  or in declaring and paying dividends to our stockholders 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants in our credit facilities could result in a default thereunder and a default under the senior convertible debentures due the debentures 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts 
table of contents outstanding under such agreement  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities  we cannot assure you that the assets securing such indebtedness would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness  including the debentures which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition 
we cannot be certain that our nols will continue to be available to offset tax liability 
our net operating loss carryforwards nols  which offset our consolidated taxable income  will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs were successful in challenging our nols  it is possible that some portion of the nols would not be available to offset our future consolidated taxable income 
as of december   we estimated that we had approximately million of nols 
in order to utilize the nols  we must generate consolidated taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the nols are also used to offset income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the reorganization in of certain of our subsidiaries engaged in the insurance business and are administered by state regulatory agencies 
as the administration of these grantor trusts is concluded  taxable income could result  which could utilize a portion of our nols and  in turn  could accelerate the date on which we may be otherwise obligated to pay incremental cash taxes 
in addition  if our existing insurance business were to require capital infusions from us in order to meet certain regulatory capital requirements  and we were to fail to provide such capital  some or all of our subsidiaries comprising our insurance business could enter insurance insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings 
in such event  such subsidiaries may no longer be included in our consolidated tax return  and a portion  which could constitute a significant portion  of our remaining nols may no longer be available to us 
in such event  there may be a significant inclusion of taxable income in our federal consolidated income tax return 
our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs 
inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
while the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls  such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and such assumptions  while reasonable  may not take into account all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission to implement section  we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in our annual report on form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past discovered  and may potentially in the future discover  areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  debentures and notes could discourage an acquisition by a third party 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without 
table of contents requiring any stockholder approval  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
certain provisions of the debentures and notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change  the holders of the debentures and notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures or notes 
we may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion or provide for conversion based on the acquirer s capital stock in the event of certain fundamental changes 
these possibilities could discourage an acquisition of us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for holders to resell our common stock when they want or at prices that they find attractive 
the price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
in addition  because the debentures are convertible into our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the debentures 
consequently  there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of an investment in our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in the waste and energy market conditions  quarterly variations in our operating results  our operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of strategic developments  significant contracts  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  changes in the economy and the financial markets  purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by existing or new holders of our common stock  departures of key personnel  changes in governmental regulations  and geopolitical conditions  such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
future issuances of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially and adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock 
in addition  the conversion of some or all of the debentures will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the trading price of our common stock
