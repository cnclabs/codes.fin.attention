the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of entry level and midrange storage systems and enterprise server software for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware  firmware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add various capacity or data protection schemes as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete multi terabyte storage area networks  or sans  provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our current product family based on our rapid evolution  or r evolution  architecture provides high performance and large disk array capacities for a broad variety of environments  employing fibre channel  or fc  internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi or serial attached scsi  or sas interconnects to switches and or hosts 
in addition  our assured family of data protection software products provides additional layers of data protection options to complement our line of storage disk arrays 
our current mainstream series of entry level storage products and just a bunch of disks  or jbod arrays have significantly increased in market share during and are targeted primarily at mainstream enterprise and small to medium business  or smb  applications 
our new replacement products for the legacy sannet ii products  the series  have been distinguished by certification as network equipment building system  or nebs  level a telecommunications standard for equipment used in central offices and are mil std f a military standard created by the us government compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability  and this legacy is continued in a number of next generation products that we brought to market in in january  we launched a new line of products to address the growing need for smaller form factor  highly dense storage utilizing sas or serial ata  or sata disks  as well as the newest generation of solid state disks  or ssds 
as a result of our ongoing strategic development  planning and evaluation  we have identified some potential higher margin business that we believe will complement our current product offerings 
accordingly  we have decided to expand our software offerings 
we plan to leverage our current products and technology to pursue selling through distributors and open storage partners  or osps 
our investment in software will require significant investment and development on our part  which will impact our cash and operating results until we generate sufficient revenues to recover our investment 

table of contents in september  we acquired certain assets  namely raidcore and network attached storage  or nas  from ciprico inc  or ciprico 
we believe this acquisition will open up new markets for us in the enterprise server and workstation markets for data protection internal to the servers and workstations 
in particular  the raidcore acquisition will allow us to broaden our product portfolio in the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  market while allowing us to sell into the band market  and to pursue opportunities at current and target oem customers 
the ciprico acquisition also provided us with a team of software development professionals located in minneapolis  minnesota 
we signed our first customer agreement relating to raidcore products in may  and began selling to this customer during the third quarter of sales in were not significant 
additionally  we do not anticipate significant sales in in december we announced that tyan  an industry leading server platform provider which is part of mitac international corporation had selected our raidcore virtual raid adapter technology to be featured in its newest server platforms 
also in december  we announced that advanced micro devices or amd will embed our raidcore virtual raid adapter technology into select platforms based on the recently announced amd sr sp server chipset 
in january  we acquired cloverleaf communications inc  or cloverleaf  a privately held software company focused on heterogeneous storage virtualization and unified storage technologies 
the acquisition of cloverleaf could broaden our market opportunities and help accelerate our transition from a provider of storage arrays to a provider of storage solutions and software 
the cloverleaf acquisition also provided us with a new team of software developers and other professionals located in israel 
the cloverleaf intelligent storage networking system  or isn  is an intelligent  network resident  storage network management system that provides a combination of benefits  features and capabilities qualified to meet the demands of mid to large sized data centers 
the isn incorporates architecture that delivers linear scalability  strong fault tolerance and high levels of availability 
the isn s open software is integrated with off the shelf hardware components and provides interoperability and networking technology flexibility 
we have decided to expand our routes to market beyond our focus on oems  and in october of  we launched a dot hill channel program targeted at selling through distributors and osps 
we believe this will provide dot hill with additional sales channels for all of our products 
our agreements with our customers do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable customer 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend on  among other things  the level and mix of orders we actually receive from such customers  the actual amounts we spend on marketing support  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time  our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our customers and the economic environment 
our products and services are sold worldwide to facilitate server and san storage implementations  primarily through original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and supplemented by system integrators  or sis  distributors and value added resellers  or vars 
our oem channel partners currently include  among others  hewlett packard  or hp  netapp  inc  or netapp  motorola  inc  or motorola  general dynamics government systems corporation  or general dynamics  lockheed martin corporation  or lockheed martin  fujitsu technology solutions gmbh  or fts  and sun microsystems  or sun 
we began shipping products to hp in the fourth quarter of in january  we amended our agreement with hp to allow for sales to additional divisions within hp 
our products are primarily sold within hp s msa product family 
sales to hp increased significantly during and increased again in primarily as a result of the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa product in as well as the successful launch of follow on products in the agreement with hp does not contain any minimum purchase commitments and the term of the agreement was extended from one to five years 
net revenue from hp approximated of our total net revenue in 
table of contents pursuant to our development and oem supply agreement with netapp  we are designing and developing general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products to be sold under private label by netapp 
we began shipping products to netapp under the agreement for general availability in the third quarter of  and net revenue from netapp increased significantly during net revenue from netapp decreased slightly in primarily as a result of general economic conditions 
net revenue from netapp approximated of our total net revenue in we have experienced a decline in net revenue from sun primarily due to the products nearing the end of their lifecycle 
net revenues from sun approximated of our total net revenue in we do not expect to generate significant net revenue from sun in future periods 
we have also experienced a decline in net revenue from fts as a result of its decision to internally source the products we sell to them 
net revenue from fts approximated of our total net revenues in we expect net revenue from fts to continue to decline in future periods as a result of this transition 
in addition  the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector  current general economic volatility and trends in the data storage markets in various geographic regions  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  and the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
our strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of the third parties manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
we have historically outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to flextronics international limited  or flextronics 
in february  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with mitac international corporation  or mitac  a leading provider of contract manufacturing and original design manufacturing services  and synnex corporation  or synnex  a leading global information technology  or it  supply chain services company 
we began shipping products for general availability under the mitac and synnex agreement in in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn technology group  or foxconn 
under the terms of the agreement  foxconn supplies us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services  through its worldwide facilities 
the agreement provides for an initial three year term that is automatically renewed at the end of such three year term for additional one year terms unless and until the agreement is terminated by either party 
foxconn began manufacturing products for us in july and we began shipping products for general availability under the foxconn agreement during the second half of we expect foxconn to manufacture a larger percentage of our products in we derive the majority of our net revenues primarily from sales of our series family of products and we are continuing to transition sannet ii customers to our series and series family of products 

table of contents cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead as well as manufacturing variances and freight 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  expenditures for administrative facilities as well as expenditures for legal and accounting services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in december  our management approved  committed to  and initiated plans to restructure and improve efficiencies in our operations 
the restructuring was due to a combination of factors  primarily driven by the economic downturn  but also driven by our plan to consolidate our facilities in carlsbad  california into the longmont  colorado facility 
the consolidation is currently in process and we anticipate it will be completed by june  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on current facts  historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
we have many accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions  the determination of useful lives of long lived assets  warranty reserves  accruals for estimated restructuring  tax and legal liabilities and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the items listed below are not inclusive of all of our accounting policies but is a listing  identified by management  of those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time 
if actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates  additional revenue reserves may be required 
our out of warranty repairs primarily consist of product repair services performed by our contract manufacturers for those customers that allowed their original product warranty to expire without purchasing one of our higher level support service plans 
revenue from these out of warranty repairs  and the associated cost of sales  is recognized in the period these services are 
table of contents provided and represent the majority of service revenue 
to a lesser degree  service revenue consists of product maintenance contracts 
revenue from our product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
we defer revenue on upfront nonrefundable payments from our customers and recognize it ratably over the term of the agreement  unless the payment is in exchange for products delivered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
when we provide consideration to a customer we recognize the value of that consideration as a reduction in net revenue 
we may be required to maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our largest oem customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of finished goods and purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead  and are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory 
the determination of excess or obsolete inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
because our markets are volatile  are subject to technological risks  price changes and inventory reduction programs by our customers  and as we are required to make last time buys of certain components on occasion  there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess inventories of particular products or have commitments to purchase excess inventory components from our suppliers 
as a result  actual demand will differ from forecasts  and such a difference has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and our results of operations 
any write downs to inventory due to the existence of excess quantities  physical obsolescence  changes in pricing  damage  or other causes establish a new cost basis for the inventory 
when we sell or dispose of reserved inventory the new cost basis is charged to cost of sales 
the largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories is the accuracy of our production and service forecasts of end customer demand 
the accuracy of our estimates depends in part on the accuracy of the non binding forecasts we get from our end customers  the accuracy of our own forecast of warranty requirements of our customers  the demand for storage systems in our market segments and the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation by measuring and recognizing share based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  restricted stock awards  performance based restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plan shares  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option and employee stock purchase plan fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date fair value is calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted  and is recognized as expense over the respective vesting period 
compensation expense for performance based restricted stock awards is measured similarly to restricted stock  however  compensation expense is only recorded for awards that ultimately vest  which is contingent upon employees achieving various performance criteria 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use historical volatility of our stock for the expected life of the grant as the expected volatility 
table of contents assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the historical volatility approach is due to the limited availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets  if any  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
as of december   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the significant economic downturn at that time  which caused a substantial decline in our market capitalization 
as of december   the carrying value of our equity significantly exceeded our market capitalization 
our long lived assets at that time consisted of our identifiable intangible assets associated with our recent acquisition of certain identified ciprico assets acquired in september with a carrying value of million  our licensed patent portfolio of million and property and equipment of million 
based upon management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows  coupled with the recent acquisition of the ciprico assets which established fair value for the assets  we determined that the carrying value of the acquired ciprico assets approximates fair value and therefore no impairment was identified 
the remaining long lived assets with a carrying value of million were tested for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets were available 
we determined the fair value of the impaired assets by discounting the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis as of december  identified million of impaired long lived assets consisting of million of property and equipment and our million licensed patent portfolio 
the long lived asset impairment is recorded as a separate component of operating expenses for the year ended december  no impairments of long lived assets were recognized for the years ended december  or 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated percentages may not add due to rounding years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge legal settlement goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the reduction in net revenue was substantially due to a decrease in sales volume and was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from sun  which sells our sannet ii family of products under the st brand product line 
our net revenue from sun decreased in compared to and totaled of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in the decline in sun net revenue is primarily due to the products we sell sun nearing the end of their lifecycle 
we do not expect to generate a significant amount of net revenue from sun in future periods 
we also experienced a reduction in net revenue from netapp in compared to primarily as a result of general economic conditions 
in addition  net revenue from fts decreased in compared to as a result of its decision to internally source the product we sell to fts 
we expect net revenue from fts to continue to decline in future periods as a result of this transition 
we also believe that the economic recession had a negative impact on our revenue 
these reductions in net revenue were partially offset by an increase in net revenue from hp who sells a version of our series family of products within their msa product family 
our net revenue from hp totaled of our total net revenue in compared to of our total net revenue in the increase in hp net revenue is primarily due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa product in as well as the successful launch of follow on products in 
table of contents cost of goods sold and gross profit of net revenue of net revenue decrease increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit the decrease in cost of goods sold and increase in gross profit as percentages of net revenue were primarily attributable to the success of our product cost reduction and value engineering initiatives over the past year which has significantly reduced our costs for both our series products that we sell to hp and other customers as well as the products we sell to netapp 
another factor that contributed to the reduction in cost of goods sold was the million decrease in net revenue 
additionally  gross profit was positively impacted by million as a result of the recognition of revenue and costs of goods sold associated with the completion of our long term contract accounted for under the completed contract method 
also contributing to the decrease in cost of goods sold and increase in gross profit were lower manufacturing variances and overhead  which declined by million in compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in payroll related costs and efficiencies gained in our manufacturing and supply chain activities  offset by a million inventory reserve charge primarily associated with sun end of life inventory and to a lesser degree certain excess component parts of our series products 
in addition  depreciation and amortization declined in by million due to the fourth quarter impairment and write off of certain long lived assets  as well as an intangible asset fully amortizing in the third quarter of partially offsetting the increase in gross profit was a decrease in net revenue from our higher margin products sold to sannet ii customers  primarily sun 
sales and marketing expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses the majority of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to lower salaries  bonuses  commissions and other employee related expenses of approximately million  a reduction in various marketing expenses of million  a decline in other professional fees of million  a decrease in allocated common costs of million  a reduction in depreciation expense of million and a decrease in severance of million 
lower overall headcount contributed to the decline in salaries  commissions and other employee related expenses including travel 
the reduction in allocated common costs was a direct result of our restructuring activities  as well as our long lived asset impairment charge  which resulted in lower facility costs and depreciation expense in the decrease in marketing expenses is due to our cost containment initiatives 
other professional fees were reduced as lower net revenue resulted in lower outside commissions 
severance decreased due to our executive vice president of sales and operations leaving the company in research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses the majority of the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in project materials  tooling  outside testing  test equipment and non recurring engineering of million in the aggregate 
we incurred a significant amount of development costs associated with the ramp up of the hp product line in this development activity resulted in significant project 
table of contents materials  tooling  outside testing  test equipment and non recurring engineering 
these costs were not incurred to the same degree in in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we determined it probable that the amount of contingent consideration due to ciprico would be considerably lower than initially expected based on lower actual and projected sales of products eligible for the contingent consideration through the end of the contingent consideration period 
accordingly  we reduced the contingent consideration liability and research and development expense in the statement of operations to reflect the million reduction in estimated contingent consideration liability 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
we also experienced a reduction in depreciation of million and a decrease in allocated common costs of million 
the reduction in allocated common costs was a direct result of our restructuring activities  as well as our long lived asset impairment charge  which resulted in lower facility costs and depreciation expense during the twelve months ended december  the remainder of the decline in costs of million related to declines in routine costs related to research and development activities  none of which were individually significant 
these decreases were partially offset by higher salaries and other payroll related expenses of million in the aggregate  an increase in intangible asset amortization of million and growth in consultant expenses of million 
the increase in salaries and other payroll related expenses was a direct result of hiring engineers to support hp as well as other development projects related to our strategic initiatives 
additionally  we hired new employees to support development activities related to the september acquisition of assets from ciprico 
the increase in intangible amortization is due to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired from ciprico  which were only outstanding for a portion of the prior year 
the increase in consultant expenses are directly related to our ongoing development activities 
general and administrative expenses of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses the majority of the reduction in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of million  recruiting fees of million  it and other consulting costs of million  allocated common costs of million  payroll related expenses of million  insurance fees of million and building rent of million 
the decreases in professional fees  consultant fees  and insurance fees are a result of lower negotiated fees with our service providers 
recruiting costs declined as we had limited recruiting activity in it consulting costs decreased as consultants were replaced with full time employees 
payroll related costs declined as a result of a reduction in headcount 
the reduction in allocated common costs was a direct result of our restructuring activities  as well as our long lived asset impairment charge  which resulted in lower facility costs and depreciation expense in building rent was lower as a direct result of closing our netherlands office during the first quarter of these decreases were offset by increases in board of director fees of million and an unfavorable foreign current exchange fluctuation of million 
restructuring charge of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages restructuring charge in december  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring plan to improve efficiencies in our operations  which was largely driven by our plan to consolidate our facility in carlsbad  california into the longmont  colorado facility 
the increase in restructuring charges incurred is primarily the result of additional contract termination costs as we exited an additional portion of our carlsbad facility in 
table of contents also contributing to the increase were higher severance related costs  which are recognized ratably over the continuing service period  and certain facility relocation costs incurred in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
legal settlement of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages legal settlement we received legal settlement proceeds in from two cases 
the proceeds from the first legal settlement of million reflects a claim we filed in february for arbitration in denver  colorado alleging that the representative of the chaparral shareholders was wrongfully withholding escrow funds due to us as a result of damages incurred by us relating to a completed patent infringement lawsuit filed by crossroads 
the proceeds from the second legal settlement of million reflects a claim we filed in december against infortrend for breach of the settlement agreement with crossroads whereby infortrend withheld million for taiwanese taxes 
such amounts are reported as a reduction in operating expenses for goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages long lived asset impairment charge at december   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of certain of our long lived assets may not be recoverable due to the significant economic downturn at that time and resulting decrease in our market capitalization 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million  consisting of million of property and equipment and million related to our licensed patent portfolio  which represents the difference between the carrying value and our estimate of the fair value of those assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
other income of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages other income  net the decrease in other income  net is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of million 
the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to declining interest rates and a more conservative investment strategy in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the united states federal statutory rate due to our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance position  foreign taxes and state taxes 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the increase in net revenue is primarily attributable to the growth in net revenue from hp  who sells a version of our series family of products  and from netapp  partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from sun who sells our sannet ii family of products under the st brand product line 
our net revenue from hp for the year ended december  totaled of total net revenue and is net of a million reduction in net revenues  representing the fair value of the warrant issued to hp to induce them to enter into an amended manufacturing agreement with us in january there was no significant net revenue from hp for the year ended december  the substantial increase in hp net revenue is due to the launch and market acceptance of the hp msa product line in march  which is based on our supplied products 
additionally  the hp net revenue included a million reimbursement from hp which was negotiated to effectively defer the price reductions provided to hp effective july  to january  we achieved certain unit shipment quantities for the three months ended september  and december  to earn the reimbursement 
the entire amount is also reflected in gross profit 
our net revenue from netapp increased from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue from netapp totaled of our total net revenue  compared to of our total net revenue for the year ended december  the rapid growth in net revenue from netapp was driven by netapp s product launch during the third quarter of  while net revenues consisted of a full year of netapp net revenue 
our net revenues from sun decreased  from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue from sun totaled  of our total net revenue  compared to of our total net revenue for the year ended december  the decline in sun net revenue is primarily due to the products nearing the end of their lifecycle and the lack of development of follow on products for the st line having been developed to date 
we expect net revenue from sun to continue to decline over future periods 
cost of goods sold of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold the increase in cost of goods sold in absolute dollars was primarily due to a growth in net revenue 
the slight increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to a change in product and customer sales mix 
net revenue from our highest margin product  sold to sun and other sannet ii customers  declined as a percentage of total net revenue 
sun net revenue decreased from of total net revenue for the year ended december  to of total net revenue for the year ended december  this was replaced by lower margin net revenue from our series products  primarily sold to hp and to a lesser extent to fts  as well as net revenue from product sold to netapp 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue associated with our series products  improved significantly from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as the series product first started shipping in the third quarter of and was initially manufactured in a mostly soft tooled environment resulting in higher cost of goods sold 
also  we substantially completed the transition of the manufacturing of our series products from flextronics to mitac and synnex and have been able to take advantage of their lower manufacturing costs 
this transition was largely completed during the fourth quarter of in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn 
under the agreement  foxconn will supply us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including 
table of contents final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its worldwide facilities 
additionally  the series product cost of goods sold has declined as a percentage of revenue due to our ability to leverage the higher volumes from hp to negotiate lower component costs 
in addition  we initiated several value engineering projects to lower product costs 
our historical experience indicates that gross profits on new products sold to new customers start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters 
thereafter the gross profit improvements are generally more modest 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue on our business with netapp improved from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily for the same reasons as for the series products 
the product we sell to netapp does not include higher margin value added features such as raid controllers 
we anticipate that cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenue  could decline due to the success of our continued efforts to reduce product costs  primarily through component cost reduction and reengineering efforts  as well as the potential to increase revenue from higher margin products  such as our series products and sales of our dms software and raidcore software 
gross profit of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages gross profit the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue of million  or  and a change in product and customer mix

liquidity and capital resources the primary drivers affecting cash and liquidity are working capital requirements  net losses  and capital expenditures 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer our customers have been relatively similar to the terms received from our creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of days or less and consist principally of money market funds

additionally  a significant amount of accounts payable was outstanding as of december  due to higher net revenue during the fourth quarter of compared to lower net revenue during the fourth quarter of  resulting in lower inventory purchases 
additional uses of cash include a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets which was primarily due to a million increase in other receivables representing component parts procured by us and sold to our contract manufacturers  a million decrease in deferred revenue that was primarily attributable to our recognizing million of deferred revenue due to the completion of our long term firm fixed price contract during  a million decrease in accrued compensation and other expenses which was primarily due to a million decrease in accrued manufacturing costs related to our obligation to purchase excess inventory from our contract manufacturers  offset by a million increase in accrued payroll primarily due to timing of payroll as well as an accrual for bonuses at year end  and a million decrease in other long term liabilities due to the amortization of our deferred rent  amortization of our netapp deferred revenue and a reduction of our ciprico contingent consideration liability 
as a result of our ongoing strategic development  planning and evaluation  we have identified a potential higher margin business that we believe will complement our current product offerings 
accordingly  we have 
table of contents decided to expand our software offerings 
we plan to leverage our current products and technology to pursue selling through distributors and osps 
our investment in software will require significant investment and development on our part  which will impact our cash and operating results until we generate sufficient revenues to recover our investment 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million for in cash used in investing activities in was primarily for the addition of data center equipment  leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the expansion of our longmont  colorado facility and tooling and equipment at our contract manufacturer locations 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to the purchase of certain indentified intangible assets from ciprico in the amount of million and million for the addition of computer hardware and software assets as well as equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to million in cash provided by financing activities in is attributable to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan of million  partially offset by a decrease of million due to the ongoing pay down of our note payable which is associated with our acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
cash provided by financing activities in is attributable to the proceeds received from the exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans of million  and the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
based on current macro economic conditions and conditions in the state of the data storage systems markets  our own organizational structure and our current outlook for  we presently expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months and for operating periods in excess of months 
on january   we acquired of the voting equity interests of cloverleaf 
our preliminary estimate of the consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition of cloverleaf approximates million  consisting of million of cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million  or per share  which represents the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date 
we paid approximately million of assumed cloverleaf liabilities at the acquisition date and expect to make additional payments during the remainder of the first quarter of  although not to the extent of the amount paid at the acquisition date 
we also incurred direct transaction costs of approximately million  most of which is expected to be paid in the first half of as a result  we expect our cash and cash equivalents balance will decrease in the first quarter of in addition  we agreed to issue  shares of restricted stock to the employees of cloverleaf who became employees of dot hill on the acquisition date 
these shares vest as follows of such shares vest upon issuance  which is expected to be on or about days following the acquisition date  of such shares vest one year from the date of issuance  and of such shares vest two years from the date of issuance 
we are currently evaluating the accounting treatment for this acquisition 
in addition  cloverleaf s historical expenses have exceeded their net revenue  which is a trend we expect to continue in for example  cloverleaf generated net revenue of million and incurred a net loss of million in as a result  we expect that the acquisition of cloverleaf will be dilutive to our results of operations and also result in a significant net cash outflow in the amount of cash needed to support the business we acquired from cloverleaf in will depend primarily on the timing of capital expenditures  product development costs and additional headcount needed to support customer requirements and improving the existing infrastructure of cloverleaf s operations 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and extent of net revenue and expenditures from our core business and strategic investments  including the acquisition of 
table of contents cloverleaf  the overall level of net profits or losses  our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  the potential growth or decline in inventory to support our customers  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services  growth in operations and the economic environment

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  or ii third party evidence  or tpe  before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these asus will have on our future consolidated financial statements

the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement also requires that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the revised guidance on business combinations to our acquisition of cloverleaf in january see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisition of cloverleaf 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which has been codified into asc topic no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we place our cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions  investing primarily in money market accounts 
we have established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification and maturities that seek to maintain safety and liquidity 
our investment strategy generally results in lower yields on investments but reduces the risk to principal in the short term prior to these funds being invested in our business 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
as of december  we had a weighted average interest rate of on our cash equivalents balance 
a unfavorable change in the interest rate would not materially impact our december  balance sheet 
we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest on any outstanding balances at the prime rate 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this line 
if we make borrowings under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported 
the most significant foreign currency to our operations that subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk for was the japanese yen 
correspondingly  our operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
although we continue to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we will likely continue to recognize gains or losses from international transactions 
although foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not historically been material  future changes in foreign currency rates could adversely impact our operating results 
a unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not materially impact our december  balance sheet
