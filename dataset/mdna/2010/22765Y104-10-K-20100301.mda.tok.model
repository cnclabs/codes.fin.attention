table of contents commodity price risk the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
its exposure to these risks is primarily in the gas processing component of its business 
the partnership currently processes gas under three main types of contractual arrangements processing margin contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink at the cost of fuel used in processing 
the shrink and fuel losses are referred to as plant thermal reduction or ptr 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
however  the partnership mitigates its risk of processing natural gas when its margins are negative under its current processing margin contracts primarily through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable for the partnership  or by contracts that revert to a minimum fee for processing if the natural gas must be processed to meet pipeline quality specifications 
percent of liquids contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of liquids contracts  but do decline during periods of low ngl prices 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure  and is paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is processed 
the gross margin presentation in the table below is calculated net of results from discontinued operations 
gas processing margins by contract types and gathering and transportation margins as a percent of total gross margin for the comparative year to date periods are as follows years ended december  gathering and transportation margin gas processing margins processing margin percent of liquids fee based total gas processing total the partnership has hedges in place at december  covering a portion of the liquids volumes it expects to receive under percent of liquids pol contracts as set forth in the following table

the ngl volumes hedged  as set forth above  focus on pol contracts 
the partnership hedges pol exposure based on volumes considered hedgeable volumes committed under contracts that are long term in nature versus total pol volumes that include volumes that may fluctuate due to contractual terms  such as contracts with month to month processing options 
the partnership hedged of its hedgeable volumes at risk through the end of of total volumes at risk

the partnership is also subject to price risk to a lesser extent for fluctuations in natural gas prices with respect to a portion of its gathering and transport services 
approximately of the natural gas the partnership markets is purchased at a percentage of the relevant natural gas index price  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the natural gas at a percentage of the index price  resale margins are higher during periods of high natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of natural gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of natural gas bought or sold under either basis  which leaves it with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and ngls using over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
as of december   outstanding natural gas swap agreements  ngl swap agreements  swing swap agreements  storage swap agreements and other derivative instruments were a net fair value liability of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical increase in gas and ngls prices would result in an increase of approximately million in the net fair value liability of these contracts as of december
