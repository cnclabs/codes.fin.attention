the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
business overview we are a leading provider of optical subsystems and components that are used to interconnect equipment in short distance local area networks  or lans  and storage area networks  or sans  and longer distance metropolitan area networks  or mans  fiber to the home networks  or fttx  cable television networks  or catv  and wide area networks  or wans 
our optical subsystems consist primarily of transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders which provide the fundamental optical electrical interface for connecting the equipment used in building these networks  including switches  routers and file servers used in wireline networks as well as antennas and base stations for wireless networks 
these products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuit design and novel packaging technology to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than gigabit per second  or gbps  to gbps  using a wide range of network protocols and physical configurations over distances of meters to kilometers 
we supply optical transceivers and transponders that allow point to point communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or  bundled with multiplexing technologies  can be used to supply multi gigabit bandwidth over several wavelengths on the same fiber 
we also provide products that are used for dynamically switching network traffic from one optical wavelength to another across multiple wavelengths without first converting to an electrical signal  known as wavelength selective switches  or wss 
these products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards  also known as reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers  or roadms 
our line of optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors used in transceivers  primarily for lan and san applications  and passive optical components used in building mans 
demand for our products is largely driven by the continually growing need for additional bandwidth created by the ongoing proliferation of data and video traffic that must be handled by both wireline and wireless networks 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and we utilize internal sources for many of the key components used in making our products including lasers  photodetectors and integrated circuits  or ics  designed by our own internal ic engineering teams 
we also have internal assembly and test capabilities that make use of internally designed equipment for the automated testing of our optical subsystems and components 
we sell our optical products to manufacturers of storage systems  networking equipment and telecommunication equipment or their contract manufacturers  such as alcatel lucent  brocade  cisco systems  emc  emulex  ericsson  hewlett packard company  huawei  ibm  juniper  qlogic  siemens and tellabs 
these customers  in turn  sell their systems to businesses and to wireline and wireless telecommunications service providers and cable tv operators  collectively referred to as carriers 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  with the support of our manufacturers representatives  directly to domestic customers and indirectly through distribution channels to international customers 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale of our optical subsystems may span a year or more 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we have undertaken measures to reduce our operating costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to achieve or sustain profitability 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan and san applications 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of overall revenue levels  shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs 

table of contents since october  we have completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
recent developments combination with optium corporation on august   we completed a business combination with optium corporation  a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance optical subsystems for use in telecommunications and cable tv network systems  through the merger of optium with a wholly owned subsidiary of finisar 
we believe that the combination of the two companies created the world s largest supplier of optical components  modules and subsystems for the communications industry and will leverage the finisar s leadership position in the storage and data networking sectors of the industry and optium s leadership position in the telecommunications and catv sectors to create a more competitive industry participant 
in addition  as a result of the combination  we expect to realize cost synergies related to operating expenses and manufacturing costs resulting from the transfer of production to lower cost locations  improved purchasing power associated with being a larger company and cost synergies associated with the integration of components into product designs previously purchased in the open market by optium 
we accounted for the combination using the purchase method of accounting and as a result have included the operating results of optium in our consolidated financial results since the august  consummation date 
at the closing of the merger  we issued  shares of finisar common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of optium 
the value of the shares issued was calculated using the five day average of the closing price of the company s common stock from the second trading day before the merger announcement date on may  through the second trading day following the announcement  or per share 
sale of network tools division on july   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our network tools division to jdsu 
we received million in cash and recorded a net gain on sale of the business of million before income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal the assets  liabilities and operating results related to this business  have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
following the completion of the sale  we no longer offer network performance test products 
these products accounted for million  million and million in revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit and operating profit margins on sales of network performance test products were generally higher than on our optical subsystem and component products 
exchange offers on august   we completed exchange offers under which we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes due for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
reverse stock split on september   we effected a one for eight reverse split of our common stock 
new credit facility on october   we entered into an agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc to establish a new million senior secured revolving credit facility to finance working capital and to refinance existing indebtedness  including the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding convertible notes 
borrowings under the credit 
table of contents facility bear interest at rates based on the prime rate and libor plus variable margins  under which applicable interest rates currently range from to per annum 
borrowings are guaranteed by finisar s us subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of finisar and its us subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures four years following the date of the agreement  subject to certain conditions 
convertible debt financing on october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of a new series of convertible senior notes due repurchase of convertible notes between september  and april   we purchased million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in privately negotiated transactions 
common stock offering on march   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
total gross proceeds of the offering were million 
net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures require that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue and operating results  as well as on the value of certain assets and contingent liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of other significant accounting policies 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the fiscal year ended april  compared to prior years other than the adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb for accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  warranty and sales returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
our standard warranty period usually extends months from the date of sale although it can extend for longer periods of three to five years for certain products sold to certain customers 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
we also provide an allowance for estimated customer returns  which is netted against revenue 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be reduced in the future 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where  subsequent to delivery  we become aware of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for the doubtful account to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and historical actual bad debt history 
a material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could result in a material reduction in the estimated amount of accounts receivable that can ultimately be collected and an increase in our general and administrative expenses for the shortfall 
slow moving and obsolete inventories we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically discard obsolete inventory 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we assume that the last twelve months demand is generally indicative of the demand for the next twelve months 
in addition to the month demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future timing of product transitions  volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual timing  volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future  or additional usage of previously written off inventory in future periods for which we would benefit from a reduced cost of revenues in those future periods 
investment in equity securities for strategic reasons  we may make minority investments in private or public companies or extend loans or receive equity or debt from these companies for services rendered or assets sold 
our minority investments in private companies are primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
our investments in these companies are passive in nature in that we generally do not obtain representation on the boards of directors 
our investments have generally been part of a larger financing in which the terms were negotiated by other investors  typically venture capital investors 
these investments are generally made in exchange for preferred stock with a liquidation preference that helps protect the underlying value of our investment 
at the time we made our investments  in most cases the companies had not completed development of their products and we did not enter into any significant supply agreements with the companies in which we invested 
in determining if and when a decline in the market value of these investments below their carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings and cash flows  price multiples  prospects for liquidity and other key measures of performance 
our policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists  such as a the completion of a new equity financing that may indicate a new value for the investment  b the failure to complete a new equity financing arrangement after seeking to raise additional funds or c the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results at any of the companies in which we hold a minority position could result in an impairment of our investment and or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments 

table of contents goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets goodwill  purchased technology  and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of purchased technology and other intangibles has been provided on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years 
goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step in which we determine the implied value of goodwill based on the allocation of the estimated fair value determined in the initial step to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we write those assets down to their fair value which is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment of the businesses in which we operate 
at april   goodwill and intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded million of additional goodwill resulting from the combination with optium 
however  we also recorded million of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed under results of operation 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation cost for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to april  was valued under the multiple option approach and will continue to be amortized using the accelerated attribution method 
subsequent to april   compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we calculate the volatility factor based on our historical stock prices 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we 
table of contents use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we measure the fair value of restricted stock units using the market value on the grant date 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
restructuring accrual we are required to recognize liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
we calculate facilities consolidation charges using estimates that are based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating the leased facilities are based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and their reported amounts  along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
we reduce the deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of all foreign corporate subsidiaries accumulated in fiscal and subsequent years 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
pending adoption of new accounting standards in april  the fasb issued revised guidance to clarify that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trade should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
the amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the amendments in this update should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the cumulative effect adjustment should be calculated for 
table of contents all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are initially applied  as if the amendments had been applied consistently since the inception of the award 
the cumulative effect adjustment should be presented separately 
earlier application is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued revised guidance intended to improve disclosures related to fair value measurements 
new disclosures under this guidance require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for us beginning may  except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements which will be effective for us beginning may we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued revised guidance to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
this guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
it must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects the impact of a combination of factors including increased spending on infrastructure by business enterprises and telecommunications companies as they deal with the ongoing growth in bandwidth through their networks as well as improvement in general economic conditions that contributed to an increase in information technology infrastructure spending 
additionally  we believe that we achieved an increase in our market share  particularly for higher speed products  due in part to the qualification of several products for higher speed applications at certain customers and our entry into new markets

impairment and amortization of acquired developed technology  components of cost of revenues  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the million impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal for intellectual property related to our acquisition of kodeos communications inc gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the million increase in revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we recorded charges of million for obsolete and excess inventory in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we sold inventory that was written off in previous periods resulting in a benefit of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result  we recognized a net charge of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal manufacturing overhead included stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding amortization of acquired developed technology  the net impact of excess and obsolete inventory charges and stock based compensation charges  gross profit would have been million  or of revenue  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenue in fiscal the slight increase in gross margin percentage primarily reflects the benefits of higher manufacturing unit volume and the increase in sales of higher margin roadm products offset by the unfavorable impact of lower pricing on some products  lower manufacturing yields on certain new higher speed components and modules and the impact of selling certain lower margin optium products for the full fiscal year compared to only eight months in fiscal as the optium merger closed at the end of august research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the additional four months of expenses of approximately million from optium operations following the merger which are included in fiscal  higher project costs and increases in employee salaries and bonuses 
included in research and development expenses were stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of revenues decreased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of the increase in revenue  partially offset by cost synergies realized as a result of the optium merger 
included in sales and marketing expenses were stock based compensation charges of million 
table of contents in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to the additional four months of expenses from optium operations following the merger which are included in fiscal offset by cost synergies realized as a result of the optium merger 
included in general and administrative expenses were stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in process research and development  or ipr d  expenses related to the optium merger were million in fiscal the were no ipr d expenses in fiscal amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the sale of assets  including all intangible assets  of our network tools division to jdsu 
impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the financial liquidity crisis  the economic recession  reductions in our internal revenue and operating forecasts and a substantial reduction in our market capitalization  during fiscal  we performed an analysis to determine if there was an indication of impairment of our intangible assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that the goodwill related to our optical subsystems and components reporting unit was impaired and had an implied fair value of compared to its carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million during the second quarter of fiscal following the completion of goodwill impairment analyses  we recorded additional charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of these impairment charges  as of april  the carrying value of our goodwill was zero 
restructuring costs 
as a result of moving certain manufacturing activities from our facility in allen  texas to our lower cost manufacturing facility in ipoh  malaysia  we have determined that approximately of the space in the allen facility is no longer required for manufacturing 
as a result  we closed that portion of the facility in the second quarter of fiscal and are actively searching for a tenant to sublease the vacated space 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal which represents the present value of the lease payments for that portion of the facility that we are obligated to make over the remaining lease term 
no restructuring charges were recorded in fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the principal repayment of million of our convertible subordinated notes due in the second quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily related to lower outstanding debt due to the principal repayment of million on our convertible subordinated notes due in the second quarter of fiscal  repayment of million of aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due and our convertible senior subordinated notes due pursuant to exchange offers in the second quarter of fiscal and repurchases of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible senior subordinated notes in the second quarter of fiscal included in interest expense for fiscal were non cash charges of million related to the accounting for our senior convertible notes due to the adoption of fasb authoritative guidance which requires us to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of our senior subordinated convertible notes that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion in a manner that reflects our non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the separation of the conversion option created an original issue discount in the bond component which is to be accreted as interest expense over the term of the instrument using the interest method  resulting in an increase in interest expense 
included in interest expense for fiscal were a non cash charge of million related to the accounting for our senior convertible notes and a non cash charge of million to amortize the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes due in october 
table of contents gain and loss on repurchase purchase of convertible notes 
during fiscal  we recorded a million loss related to the repurchase of certain convertible notes 
on august   we retired million  or  of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due and million  or approximately  of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due pursuant to exchange offers which commenced on july  the consideration for the exchange consisted of i in cash and ii shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock and paid out approximately million in cash to the former holders of notes in the exchange offers 
the total consideration paid in the exchange was approximately million less than the par value of the notes retired 
this exchange was considered to be an induced conversion in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance and the retirement of the notes was accounted for as if they had been converted according to their original terms  with that value compared to the fair value of the consideration paid in the exchange offers 
the original conversion price of the notes was per share 
accordingly  although the trading price of our common stock was at the time of the exchange  we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of million in the quarter ended november  the additional million of loss on debt extinguishment was primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with the exchange offers 
during fiscal  we recorded a million gain on the repurchase of certain convertible notes 
the gain was related to the repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible notes due october  that we purchased at a discount to par value of 
other income expense  net 
other expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other expense in fiscal was primarily related to a million other than temporary write down of a minority interest investment

the closing price of our common stock on may  was  while a five day average used to calculate the consideration paid in the merger was 
the preliminary allocation of the merger consideration resulted in the recognition of an additional million of goodwill which  when combined with the million of goodwill acquired prior to the merger  resulted in a total goodwill balance of approximately million 
the actual operating results and outlook for both companies between the date of the definitive agreement and the effective date of the merger had not changed to any significant degree  with both companies separately reporting record revenues for their interim quarters 
between the effective date of the merger and november   the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
among these indicators were a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the widespread unavailability of business and consumer credit  a significant decrease in our market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock to at the end of the quarter and a decrease in internal expectations for near term revenues  especially those expected to result from the optium merger 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
as of the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter of fiscal  we had not completed our analysis due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill for the optical subsystems and components reporting unit  which is based on the determination of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of this reporting unit 
however  based on the work performed through the date of the filing  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge  representing our best estimate of the impairment loss during the second quarter of fiscal while finalizing our impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there were additional indicators sufficient to require another interim goodwill impairment analysis 
among these indicators were a worsening of the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the unavailability of business and consumer credit  an additional decrease in our market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock to at the end of the quarter and a further decrease in internal expectations for near term revenues 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were again based on a combination of the income

operating lease obligations consist primarily of base rents for facilities we occupy at various locations 
purchase obligations are related to materials purchased and held by subcontractors on our behalf to fulfill the subcontractors purchase order obligations at their facilities 
our policy with respect to all purchase obligations is to record losses  if any  when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
we believe we have made adequate provision for potential exposure related to inventory purchased by subcontractors which may go unused

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at rates based on the prime rate and libor plus variable margins  under which applicable interest rates currently range from to per annum

on october   we terminated agreements with silicon valley bank under which various credit facilities had previously been available to us 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the cash expected to be generated from future operations and borrowings under our bank credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to fund our operations in the future or to repay or otherwise retire all of our outstanding convertible notes due  in the aggregate principal amount of million which is subject to redemption by the holders in october   and a significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital if and when it is required  especially if we experience disappointing operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements at april  and april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of april   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following table summarizes principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair market value of the debt securities issued by us as of april  in thousands 
fiscal years ended april  fair and market thereafter total cost value liabilities long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate our variable rate debt were primarily dependent upon libor rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership interest is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
at april   we had investments in four privately held companies that totaled million and were accounted for under the cost method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
there were impairment losses on these assets of million during fiscal we concluded that there were sufficient indicators during the second quarter of fiscal to require an investment impairment analysis of our investment in one of these companies 
among these indicators was the completion of a new round of equity financing by the investee and the resultant conversion of the company s preferred stock holdings to common stock 
we determined that the value of our minority equity investment was impaired and recorded a million impairment loss as other expense during the second quarter of fiscal no impairment losses were recorded in fiscal and fiscal if our investment in a privately held company becomes readily marketable upon the company s completion of an initial public offering or its acquisition by another company  our investment would be subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
we have subsidiaries located in china  malaysia  europe  israel  australia and singapore 
due to the relative volume of transactions through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years
