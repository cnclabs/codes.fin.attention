item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that our accounting policies and estimates relating to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation charges are the most critical 
revenue recognition revenue from corporate collaborations and licensing agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding and milestone payments 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the related performance period 
we estimate the performance period as the period in which we perform certain development activities under the applicable agreement 
reimbursements for research and development activities are recorded in the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the applicable agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the applicable agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that such milestone is substantive in nature 

table of contents the million upfront payment received in january under the research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca and the additional million received pursuant to the september amendment has been recognized as revenue over the period ended january  the completion of the research collaboration portion of the agreement 
in  we entered into a collaborative development and marketing agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc king to jointly develop and commercialize bremelanotide  which agreement was terminated effective december deferred revenue related to the king agreement had been recognized as revenue over the estimated period of our performance during the initial development term of this agreement 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  we recognized as revenue in our fiscal year ended june  all remaining deferred up front license fees received from king  together with associated deferred costs  in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
accrued expenses third parties perform a significant portion of our development activities 
we review the activities performed under significant contracts each quarter and accrue expenses and the amount of any reimbursement to be received from our collaborators based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
estimating the value or stage of completion of certain services requires judgment based on available information 
if we do not identify services performed for us but not billed by the service provider  or if we underestimate or overestimate the value of services performed as of a given date  reported expenses will be understated or overstated 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock options granted has been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make estimates of expected volatility and expected option lives 
we estimate these factors at the time of grant based on our own prior experience  public sources of information and information for comparable companies 
the amount of recorded compensation related to an option grant is not adjusted for subsequent changes in these estimates or for actual experience 
the amount of our recorded compensation is also dependent on our estimates of future option forfeitures and the probability of achievement of performance conditions 
if we initially over estimate future forfeitures  our reported expenses will be understated until such time as we adjust our estimate 
ch anges in estimated forfeitures will affect our reported expenses in the period of change and future periods 
the amount and timing of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to grants of restricted stock units may be affected by employment terminations 
as a result  stock based compensation charges may vary significantly from period to period 
results of operations year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  we recognized million in revenue compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal pursuant to our research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal and fiscal consists of million and million  respectively  of revenue related to our research services performed during those periods  and million and million  respectively  of revenue related to astrazeneca s up front license fee 
in connection with the completion of the research collaboration portion of the research collaboration and license agreement  we recognized as revenue in fiscal all remaining deferred up front license fees received from astrazeneca 
future contract revenue from astrazeneca  in the form of reimbursement of development costs  will fluctuate based on development activities in our obesity program 
we may also earn contract revenue based on the attainment of development milestones 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is the result of the restructuring of our clinical stage product portfolio and development programs 
research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  other melanocortin receptor agonists  pl  obesity  neutrospec and other preclinical programs were million in each of fiscal years and spending to date has been primarily related to the identification and optimization of lead compounds  and secondarily to study the effects of melanocortin receptor specific compounds on food intake  obesity and other metabolic parameters and preclinical studies and a phase trial with subcutaneously administered bremelanotide 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trials 
table of contents and preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the historical amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily related to management s refinement of operations and expense control 
cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec and other programs which include pl  other melanocortin receptor agonists  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated 
see item a risk factors 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily related to management s refinement of operations and expense control 
income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have incurred net operating losses  primarily related to spending on our research and development programs 
we have financed our net operating losses primarily through equity financings and amounts received under collaborative agreements 
our product candidates are at various stages of development and will require significant further research  development and testing and may never be successfully developed or commercialized 
we may experience uncertainties  delays  difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies  which may include unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to the development and testing of products in animals and humans  product approval or clearance  regulatory compliance  good manufacturing practices  intellectual property rights  product introduction  marketing  sales and competition  and obtaining sufficient capital 
failure to obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates and indications would impact our ability to increase revenues and could make it more difficult to attract investment capital for funding our operations 
any of these possibilities could materially and adversely affect our operations and require us to curtail or cease certain programs 
during fiscal  we used million of cash for our operating activities  compared to million used in fiscal net cash outflows from operations in fiscal were favorably impacted by the decrease in research and development expenses and the receipt of million in additional payments from astrazeneca 
net cash outflows from operations in fiscal were favorably impacted by the receipt of in additional payments from astrazeneca 
our periodic accounts receivable balances will continue to be highly dependent on the timing of receipts from collaboration partners and the division of development responsibilities between us and our collaboration partners 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was  consisting mainly of the sale of property compared to million provided by investing activities in fiscal  which  consisted mainly of the sale of property and equipment 

table of contents for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily reflecting the aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from the sales in august  february and june of  units   units and  units  respectively  in registered direct offerings 
each unit from the august offering consisted of one share of common stock and a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
each unit from the february offering consisted of one share of common stock  a series a warrant exercisable for shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock and a series b warrant exercisable for shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock 
the series a warra nt is exercisable days from the date of issuance and expires three years thereafter  the series b warrant was exercisable immediately upon issuance and originally expired days from the date of issuance 
management extended the expiration date of the series b warrants an additional days 
each unit from the june offering consisted of one share of common stock and a one year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  consisting entirely of payments on capital lease obligations 
we have incurred cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and our available for sale investments were million 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments are not sufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months 
this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have made the strategic decision to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials for bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formulation of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction  and have ceased research and development efforts on new product candidates 
as part of this decision  we have implemented reductions in staffing levels  and anticipate having no more than twenty employees by december  we also intend to raise additional capital by december  the accompanying consolidated financi al statements have been prepared assuming that we continue as a going concern 
we intend to seek additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements on our product candidates  or other sources 
however  sufficient additional funding to support projected operations  including clinical trials with either bremelanotide or pl  or both  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and relinquish  license or otherwise dispose of rights on unfavorable terms to technologies and product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
the nature and timing of our development activities are highly dependent on our financing activities 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds to advance at least one of our product candidates  we will implement plans for the orderly wind down of our business operations  including curtailing operations significantly and further decreasing staffing levels  and will seek to license  sell or otherwise dispose of our product candidates  technologies and contractual rights  including rights under our research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca  on the best possible terms available 
even if we are able to license  sell or otherwise dispose of our product candidates  technologies and contractual rights  it is likely to be on unfavorable terms and for less value than if we had the financial resources to develop or otherwise advance our product candidates  technologies and contractual rights ourselves 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next few years 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products  conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market such technologies and proposed products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and we do not know whether we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of june  
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases capital lease obligations license agreements total contractual obligations our license agreement related to neutrospec requires royalty payments on commercial net sales and payments of up to million contingent on the achievement of specified cumulative net margins on sales by mallinckrodt 
no contingent amounts will be payable related to neutrospec unless we recommence sales and marketing of neutrospec 
we do not expect to make any such contingent payments during the next twelve months
