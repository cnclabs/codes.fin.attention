industry market growth for our products is primarily driven by favorable demographics 
the number of surgical procedures performed is increasing and we believe the long term demographic trend will be continued growth in surgical procedures as a result of the aging of the population  and technological advancements  which result in safer and less invasive or non invasive surgical procedures 
additionally  as people are living longer  more active lives  they are engaging in contact sports and activities such as running  skiing  rollerblading  golf and tennis which result in injuries with greater frequency and at an earlier age than ever before 
sales of surgical products aggregated approximately of our total net revenues in see products 
continued pressure to reduce health care costs 
in response to rising health care costs  managed care companies and other third party payers have placed pressures on health care providers to reduce costs 
as a result  health care providers have focused on the high cost areas such as surgery 
to reduce costs  health care providers use minimally invasive techniques  which generally reduce patient trauma  recovery time and ultimately the length of hospitalization 
approximately of our products are designed for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
see products 
health care providers are also increasingly purchasing single use  disposable products  which reduce the costs associated with sterilizing surgical instruments and products following surgery 
the single use nature of disposable products lowers the risk of incorrectly sterilized instruments spreading infection into the patient and increasing the cost of post operative care 
approximately of our sales are derived from single use disposable products 
in the united states  the pressure on health care providers to contain costs has caused many health care providers to enter into comprehensive purchasing contracts with fewer suppliers  which offer a broader array of products at lower prices 
in addition  many health care providers have aligned themselves with group purchasing organizations gpos or integrated health networks ihns  whose stated purpose is to aggregate the purchasing volume of their members in order to negotiate competitive pricing with suppliers  including manufacturers of surgical products 
we believe that these trends will favor entities which offer a diverse product portfolio

electrosurgery is routinely used to cut and coagulate tissue and small vessels in open and laparoscopic procedures using energy produced through radio frequency rf technology 
an electrosurgical system consists of three main components an electrosurgical generator or esu  an active electrode in the form of an electrosurgical pencil or instrument that is used to apply concentrated energy to the target tissues  and a dispersive electrode that grounds the patient and provides feedback to the esu 
electrosurgery can be used in almost all surgical procedures including specialties such as general  gynecology  orthopedics  cardiology  thoracics  urology  neurology  and dermatology 
also included in our portfolio of energy based products is the argon beam coagulation abc technology 
abc technology combines the use of argon gas and electrosurgical energy to allow the surgeon to produce a surface coagulation which results in less tissue damage 
the electrical energy travels through an ionized column of gas so that the energy is applied to bleeding tissue in a non contact mode 
clinicians have reported notable benefits of abc technology in certain procedures such as liver resection  cancer tissue resection  heart bypass and trauma 
in addition  certain handpieces allow abc to be used to dissect tissue through direct contact 
surgical smoke evacuation products are an emerging segment within the electrosurgical market 
these systems consist of a smoke evacuation unit which suctions surgical smoke from the operative site and filters the smoke plume 
it is connected to the esu and uses specific electrosurgical smoke evacuation pencils 
the use of electrosurgical pencils and lasers during a procedure may produce smoke and may affect the surgeon s ability to see the operative site clearly in both open and laparoscopic procedures

softcheck ultracheck registered trademarks of cas medical systems  inc endosurgery endosurgery also referred to as minimally invasive surgery or laparoscopic surgery is surgery performed without a major incision 
this surgical specialty results in less trauma for the patient and produces important cost savings as a result of shorter recovery times and reduced hospitalization 
endosurgery is performed on organs in the abdominal cavity such as the gallbladder  appendix and female reproductive organs 
during such procedures  devices called trocars are used to puncture the abdominal wall and are then removed  leaving in place a trocar cannula 
the trocar cannula provides access into the abdomen for camera systems and surgical instruments 
some of our endosurgical instruments are reposable  meaning that the instrument has a disposable and a reusable component 
our endosurgical products include the reflex and permaclip clip appliers for vessel and duct ligation  universal s itm suction irrigation and universal plus laparoscopic instruments  specialized suction irrigation electrosurgical instrument systems for use in laparoscopic surgery and the oneport which incorporates a blunt tipped version of a trocar 
the oneport dilates access through the body wall rather than cutting with the sharp  pointed tips of conventional trocars thus resulting in smaller wounds  and less bleeding

our financial performance is dependent on conditions in the health care industry and the broader economy 
the results of our business are directly tied to the economic conditions in the health care industry and the broader economy as a whole 
given the difficult economic environment we experienced in and much of including extreme volatility in the financial markets and foreign currency exchange rates and depressed economic conditions in both domestic and international markets  we continue to face significant business challenges 
approximately of our revenues are derived from the sale of capital products 
the sales of such products are negatively impacted if hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to secure the financing necessary to purchase these products or otherwise defer purchases 
our revenue declined in as compared to primarily as a result of the difficult economic environment 
while we are cautiously optimistic that the overall global economic environment is improving and are therefore forecasting a return to revenue growth in  there can be no assurance that the improvement in the economic environment will be sustained or that revenue growth will be achieved 
our significant international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from foreign sales 
approximately of our total consolidated net sales were to customers outside the united states 
we have sales subsidiaries in a significant number of countries in europe as well as australia  canada and korea 
in those countries in which we have a direct presence  our sales are denominated in the local currency and those sales denominated in local currency amounted to approximately of our total net sales in the remaining of sales to customers outside the united states was on an export basis and transacted in united states dollars 
because a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products 
while we have implemented a hedging strategy  our revenues may be unfavorably impacted from foreign currency translation if the united states dollar strengthens as compared with currencies such as the euro 
our international presence exposes us to certain other inherent risks  including imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by international subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries  trade barriers  political risks  including political instability  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  hyperinflation in certain foreign countries  and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our financial performance is subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy  including the effects of increased borrowing and integration of newly acquired businesses or product lines 
a key element of our business strategy has been to expand through acquisitions and we may seek to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our success is dependent in part upon our ability to integrate acquired companies or product lines into our existing operations 
we may not have sufficient management and other resources to accomplish the integration of our past and future acquisitions and implementing our acquisition strategy may strain our relationship with customers  suppliers  distributors  manufacturing personnel or others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
in addition  while we are generally entitled to customary indemnification from sellers of businesses for any difficulties that may have arisen prior to our acquisition of each business  acquisitions may involve exposure to unknown liabilities and the amount and time for claiming under these indemnification provisions is often limited 
as a result  our financial performance is now and will continue to be subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses  including the financial effects associated with any increased borrowing required to fund such acquisitions or with the integration of such businesses 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in recalls  fines or materially adverse implications 
substantially all of our products are classified as class ii medical devices subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies  including the fda and comparable foreign counterparts 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on site inspection and continuing review by the fda for compliance with the quality system regulations 
manufacturing and sales of our products outside the united states are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements which vary from country to country 
moreover  we are generally required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval prior to marketing a new product 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign approvals may differ from fda requirements 
failure to comply with applicable domestic and or foreign regulatory requirements may result in fines or other enforcement actions  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances  refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices  increased quality control costs  or criminal prosecution 
failure to comply with quality system regulations and applicable foreign regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are not able to manufacture products in compliance with regulatory standards  we may decide to cease manufacturing of those products and may be subject to product recall 
in addition to the quality system regulations  many of our products are also subject to industry defined standards 
we may not be able to comply with these regulations and standards due to deficiencies in component parts or our manufacturing processes 
if we are not able to comply with the quality system regulations or industry defined standards  we may not be able to fill customer orders and we may decide to cease production of non compliant products 
failure to produce products could affect our profit margins and could lead to loss of customers 
our products are subject to product recall and we have made product recalls in the past  including million in related to certain of our powered surgical instrument handpieces 
although no recall has had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition  we cannot assure you that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation in the future or that product recalls will not harm our reputation and our customer relationships 
the highly competitive market for our products may create adverse pricing pressures 
the market for our products is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives of supply 
many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons  hospitals  group purchasing organizations and others 
in addition  several of our competitors are large  technically competent firms with substantial assets 
competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 
factors which may influence our customers choice of competitor products include changes in surgeon preferences  increases or decreases in health care spending related to medical devices  our inability to supply products to them  as a result of product recall  market withdrawal or back order  the introduction by competitors of new products or new features to existing products  the introduction by competitors of alternative surgical technology  and advances in surgical procedures  discoveries or developments in the health care industry 
we use a variety of raw materials in our businesses  and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 
our reliance on certain suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials 
in some instances  we participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers 
a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers  price increases  or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities  could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 
we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
cost reduction efforts in the health care industry could put pressures on our prices and margins 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs 
such efforts include national health care reform  trends towards managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of health care distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by gpos and ihns 
demand and prices for our products may be adversely affected by such trends 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological change or to successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance  which could cause us to lose business to competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products on a cost effective basis  to introduce them to the market on a timely basis  and to have them accepted by surgeons 
we may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products 
factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include capital constraints  research and development delays  delays in securing regulatory approvals  or changes in the competitive landscape  including the emergence of alternative products or solutions which reduce or eliminate the markets for pending products 
our new products may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance 
new product introductions may fail to achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in the time frames we currently estimate  our ability to successfully implement new technologies  the market s readiness to accept new products  having adequate financial and technological resources for future product development and promotion  the efficacy of our products  and the prices of our products compared to the prices of our competitors products 
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to recover our investments and may lose business to competitors 
in addition  some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 
our senior credit agreement contains covenants which may limit our flexibility or prevent us from taking actions 
our senior credit agreement contains  and future credit facilities are expected to contain  certain restrictive covenants which will affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  sell assets  and pursue acquisitions 
these covenants  unless waived  may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions  significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities 
our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
in the event of any default under our credit agreement  the credit agreement lenders may elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such borrowings  the credit agreement lenders could proceed against collateral securing the credit agreement  which consists of substantially all of our property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are sold in connection with the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the accounts receivable sales agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause which may limit our ability to access additional funding under our credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur 
our leverage and debt service requirements may require us to adopt alternative business strategies 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  net of a debt discount on our convertible senior subordinated notes of million  representing of total capitalization and which does not include the million of accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to investors  including but not limited to the following a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited or impaired  or may be at higher interest rates  we may be at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors that are less leveraged  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to market conditions  our degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse circumstances applicable to us  and our interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our borrowings  including our borrowings under our credit agreement  are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness  which could require us to reduce our expenditures  sell assets  restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not have sufficient cash flow available to enable us to meet our obligations 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as foregoing acquisitions  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies could be implemented on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our indebtedness and its implications 
we may be unable to continue to sell our accounts receivable  which could require us to seek alternative sources of financing 
under our accounts receivable sales agreement  there are certain statistical ratios which must be maintained relating to the pool of receivables in order for us to continue selling to the purchaser 
these ratios relate to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable 
if new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale or the purchaser otherwise ceases to purchase our receivables  we may require access to alternate sources of working capital  which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective october  whereby the purchase commitment was decreased from million to million and extended through october  under otherwise substantially the same terms and conditions 
in the event we are unable to renew our purchaser commitment in the future  we would need to access alternate sources of working capital which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
if we infringe third parties patents  or if we lose our patents or they are held to be invalid  we could become subject to liability and our competitive position could be harmed 
much of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is covered by patents 
we have numerous us patents and corresponding foreign patents on products expiring at various dates from through and have additional patent applications pending 
see research and development for a further description of our patents 
the loss of our patents could reduce the value of the related products and any related competitive advantage 
competitors may also be able to design around our patents and to compete effectively with our products 
in addition  the cost of enforcing our patents against third parties and defending our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial 
we cannot assure you that pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged by competitors  our patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage  or we will be successful in defending against pending or future patent infringement claims asserted against our products 
ordering patterns of our customers may change resulting in reductions in sales 
our hospital and surgery center customers purchase our products in quantities sufficient to meet their anticipated demand 
likewise  our health care distributor customers purchase our products for ultimate resale to health care providers in quantities sufficient to meet the anticipated requirements of the distributors customers 
should inventories of our products owned by our hospital  surgery center and distributor customers grow to levels higher than their requirements  our customers may reduce the ordering of products from us 
this could result in reduced sales during a financial accounting period 
we can be sued for producing defective products and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the nature and amount of any product liability claims 
the nature of our products as medical devices and today s litigious environment should be regarded as potential risks which could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance we maintain to protect against claims associated with the use of our products have deductibles and may not adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us 
we are also exposed to the risk that our insurers may become insolvent or that premiums may increase substantially 
see legal proceedings for a further discussion of the risk of product liability actions and our insurance coverage 
damage to our physical properties as a result of windstorm  earthquake  fire or other natural or man made disaster may cause a financial loss and a loss of customers 
although we maintain insurance coverage for physical damage to our property and the resultant losses that could occur during a business interruption  we are required to pay deductibles and our insurance coverage is limited to certain caps 
for example  our deductible for windstorm damage to our florida property amounts to of any loss and coverage for earthquake damage to our california properties is limited to million 
further  while insurance reimburses us for our lost gross earnings during a business interruption  if we are unable to supply our customers with our products for an extended period of time  there can be no assurance that we will regain the customers business once the product supply is returned to normal 
item properties facilities the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our principal operating facilities 
we believe that our facilities are generally well maintained  are suitable to support our business and adequate for present and anticipated needs

likewise  from time to time  the company may receive a subpoena from a government agency such as the equal employment opportunity commission  occupational safety and health administration  the department of labor  the treasury department  and other federal and state agencies or foreign governments or government agencies 
these subpoena may or may not be routine inquiries  or may begin as routine inquiries and over time develop into enforcement actions of various types 
the product liability claims are generally covered by various insurance policies  subject to certain deductible amounts  maximum policy limits and certain exclusions in the respective policies or required as a matter of law 
in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification by third parties 
when there is no insurance coverage  as would typically be the case primarily in lawsuits alleging patent infringement or in connection with certain government investigations  or indemnification obligation of a third party we establish reserves sufficient to cover probable losses associated with such claims 
we do not expect that the resolution of any pending claims or investigations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future claims or investigations  or the costs associated with responding to such claims or investigations  especially claims and investigations not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
manufacturers of medical products may face exposure to significant product liability claims 
to date  we have not experienced any product liability claims that are material to our financial statements or condition  but any such claims arising in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we currently maintain commercial product liability insurance of million per incident and million in the aggregate annually  which we believe is adequate 
this coverage is on a claims made basis 
there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed insurance coverage  that the carriers will be solvent or that such insurance will be available to us in the future at a reasonable cost 
our operations are subject  and in the past have been subject  to a number of environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use  handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  soil and groundwater remediation and employee health and safety 
in some jurisdictions environmental requirements may be expected to become more stringent in the future 
in the united states certain environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of site restoration upon each of the parties that may have contributed to conditions at the site regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the party s activities 
while we do not believe that the present costs of environmental compliance and remediation are material  there can be no assurance that future compliance or remedial obligations would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on april   conmed received a copy of a complaint filed in the united states district for the northern district of new york on behalf of a purported class of former conmed linvatec sales representatives 
the complaint alleges that the former sales representatives were entitled to  but did not receive  severance in when conmed linvatec restructured its distribution channels 
the range of loss associated with this complaint ranges from to million  not including any interest  fees or costs that might be awarded if the five named plaintiffs were to prevail on their own behalf as well as on behalf of the approximately or as alleged by the plaintiffs other members of the purported class 
conmed linvatec did not generally pay severance during the restructuring because the former sales representatives were offered sales positions with conmed linvatec s new manufacturer s representatives 
other than three of the five named plaintiffs in the class action  nearly all of conmed linvatec s former sales representatives accepted such positions 
the company s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment  which were heard at a hearing held on january   were denied by a memorandum decision and order dated may  the district court also granted the plaintiffs motion to certify a class of former conmed linvatec sales representatives whose employment with conmed linvatec was involuntarily terminated in and who did not receive severance benefits 
with discovery essentially completed  on july   the company filed motions seeking summary judgment and to decertify the class 
in addition  on july   plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary judgment 
these motions were submitted for decision on august  there is no fixed time frame within which the court is required to rule on the motions 
the company believes there is no merit to the claims asserted in the complaint  and plans to vigorously defend the case 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will prevail in the litigation

overview of conmed corporation conmed corporation conmed  the company  we or us is a medical technology company with an emphasis on surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures and monitoring 
the company s products serve the clinical areas of arthroscopy  powered surgical instruments  electrosurgery  cardiac monitoring disposables  endosurgery and endoscopic technologies 
they are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics  general surgery  gynecology  neurosurgery  and gastroenterology 
these product lines and the percentage of consolidated revenues associated with each  are as follows arthroscopy powered surgical instruments electrosurgery patient care endosurgery endoscopic technologies consolidated net sales a significant amount of our products are used in surgical procedures with approximately of our revenues derived from the sale of disposable products 
our capital equipment offerings also facilitate the ongoing sale of related disposable products and accessories  thus providing us with a recurring revenue stream 
we manufacture substantially all of our products in facilities located in the united states  mexico and finland 
we market our products both domestically and internationally directly to customers and through distributors 
international sales approximated  and in  and  respectively 
business environment and opportunities the aging of the worldwide population along with lifestyle changes  continued cost containment pressures on healthcare systems and the desire of clinicians and administrators to use less invasive or noninvasive procedures are important trends which are driving the long term growth in our industry 
we believe that with our broad product offering of high quality surgical and patient care products  we can capitalize on this growth for the benefit of the company and our shareholders 
in order to further our growth prospects  we have historically used strategic business acquisitions and exclusive distribution relationships to continue to diversify our product offerings  increase our market share and realize economies of scale 
we have a variety of research and development initiatives focused in each of our principal product lines as continued innovation and commercialization of new proprietary products and processes are essential elements of our long term growth strategy 
our reputation as an innovator is exemplified by recent new product introductions such as the conmed linvatec shoulder restoration system  a comprehensive system for rotator cuff repair 
business challenges given significant volatility in the financial markets and foreign currency exchange rates and depressed economic conditions in both domestic and international markets  presented significant business challenges 
our revenue declined in as compared to primarily as a result of the difficult economic environment 
while we are cautiously optimistic that the overall global economic environment is improving and are therefore forecasting a return to revenue growth in  there can be no assurance that the improvement in the economic environment will be sustained or that revenue growth will be achieved 
we will continue to monitor and manage the impact of the overall economic environment on the company 
during we successfully completed the first phase of our operational restructuring plan which we had previously announced in the second quarter of during  we will begin the second phase of our operational restructuring plan which involves further expanding our lower cost mexican operations by transferring additional production lines to our chihuahua  mexico facility which we believe will yield additional cost savings 
we expect the second phase of our restructuring plan to be largely completed by the fourth quarter of however  we cannot be certain such activities will be completed in the estimated time period or that planned cost savings will be achieved 
our conmed endoscopic technologies operating segment has suffered from sales declines and operating losses since its acquisition from cr bard in september we have corrected the operational issues associated with product shortages that resulted following the acquisition of the endoscopic technologies business and have consolidated the administrative functions of the endoscopic technologies business from chelmsford  massachusetts to our corporate headquarters in utica  new york 
we believe by reducing costs while continuing to invest in new product development  we can achieve increased sales and ensure a return to profitability 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory agencies for  among other things  conformance to quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
our products are also subject to product recall and we have made product recalls in the past  including million in related to certain of our powered instrument handpieces 
we are committed to the principles and strategies of systems based quality management for improved cgmp compliance  operational performance and efficiencies through our company wide quality systems initiative 
however  there can be no assurance that our actions will ensure that we will not receive a warning letter or other regulatory action which may include consent decrees or fines  or that we will not make product recalls in the future 
critical accounting policies preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title has been transferred to the customer which is at the time of shipment 
the following policies apply to our major categories of revenue transactions sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped under our stated shipping terms 
payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital equipment shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
the cost of the equipment is amortized over the term of individual commitment agreements 
product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in accordance with our returned goods policy 
historically the level of product returns has not been significant 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon an analysis of historical customer returns and credits  rebates  discounts and current market conditions 
our terms of sale to customers generally do not include any obligations to perform future services 
limited warranties are provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product sale based upon an analysis of historical data 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling have been included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs included in selling and administrative expense were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses resulting from accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of our products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate 
goodwill and intangible assets we have a history of growth through acquisitions 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment testing 
it is our policy to perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting units 
estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and other valuation techniques 
future cash flows may be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
we completed our goodwill impairment testing as of october  and determined that no impairment existed at that date 
for our conmed electrosurgery  conmed endosurgery and conmed linvatec operating units  our impairment testing utilized conmed corporation s ebit multiple adjusted for a market based control premium with the resultant fair values exceeding carrying values by to 
our conmed patient care operating unit has the least excess of fair value over carrying value of our reporting units  we therefore utilized both a market based approach and an income approach when performing impairment testing with the resultant fair value exceeding carrying value by 
the income approach contained certain key assumptions including that revenue would resume historical growth patterns in while including certain cost savings associated with the operational restructuring plan completed during we continue to monitor events and circumstances for triggering events which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units and require us to perform impairment testing 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset and are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of an intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its current fair value 
customer relationship assets arose principally as a result of the acquisition of linvatec corporation 
these assets represent the acquisition date fair value of existing customer relationships based on the after tax income expected to be derived during their estimated remaining useful life 
the useful lives of these customer relationships were not and are not limited by contract or any economic  regulatory or other known factors 
the estimated useful life of the linvatec customer relationship assets was determined as of the date of acquisition as a result of a study of the observed pattern of historical revenue attrition during the years immediately preceding the acquisition of linvatec corporation 
this observed attrition pattern was then applied to the existing customer relationships to derive the future expected retirement of the customer relationships 
this analysis indicated an annual attrition rate of 
assuming an exponential attrition pattern  this equated to an average remaining useful life of approximately years for the linvatec customer relationship assets 
customer relationship intangible assets arising as a result of other business acquisitions are being amortized over a weighted average life of years 
the weighted average life for customer relationship assets in aggregate is years 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of our customer relationship intangible assets each reporting period in order to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
in order to further evaluate the remaining useful life of our customer relationship intangible assets  we perform an annual analysis and assessment of actual customer attrition and activity 
this assessment includes a comparison of customer activity since the acquisition date and review of customer attrition rates 
in the event that our analysis of actual customer attrition rates indicates a level of attrition that is in excess of that which was originally contemplated  we would change the estimated useful life of the related customer relationship asset with the remaining carrying amount amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
we test our customer relationship assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors specific to our customer relationship assets which might lead to an impairment charge include a significant increase in the annual customer attrition rate or otherwise significant loss of customers  significant decreases in sales or current period operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast of losses 
we do not believe that there have been events or changes in circumstances which would indicate the carrying amount of our customer relationship assets might not be recoverable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets 
pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all our employees 
major assumptions used in accounting for the plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and expected mortality 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated annually as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the board of directors approved a plan to freeze benefit accruals under our pension plan effective may  as a result  we recorded a curtailment gain of million and a reduction in accrued pension of million which is included in other long term liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to the citigroup pension liability index 
however  this index gives only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the index do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
this discount rate  which is used in determining pension expense  was in compared to for the first quarter of the discount rate used for purposes of remeasuring plan liabilities as of the date the plan freeze was approved and for purposes of measuring pension expense for the remainder of was 
the rate used in determining pension expense is 
we have used an expected rate of return on pension plan assets of for purposes of determining the net periodic pension benefit cost 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 
in addition  we consult with financial and investment management professionals in developing appropriate targeted rates of return 
we have estimated our rate of increase in employee compensation levels at consistent with our internal budgeting 
pension expense in is expected to be million compared to a net pension gain of million including a million curtailment gain and pension expense of million in in addition  we will be required to contribute approximately million to the pension plan for the plan year 
we have recorded additional expense of approximately million in the year ended december  related to an additional employer k contribution which is intended to offset some of the impact on employees of the freeze in pension benefit accruals 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation all share base payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units  and stock appreciation rights are recognized in the financial statements based at their fair values 
compensation expense is recognized using a straight line method over the vesting period 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within and outside the united states 
we face audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending through tax years subsequent to are subject to future examination 
we have established a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards recognized in connection with an acquisition 
effective january   changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date  including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to this effective date  generally will affect income tax expense 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and ongoing and future taxable income levels

operating segment results segment information is prepared on the same basis that we review financial information for operational decision making purposes 
we conduct our business through five principal operating segments conmed endoscopic technologies  conmed endosurgery  conmed electrosurgery  conmed linvatec and conmed patient care 
based upon the aggregation criteria for segment reporting  we have grouped our conmed endosurgery  conmed electrosurgery and conmed linvatec operating segments into a single reporting segment 
the economic characteristics of conmed patient care and conmed endoscopic technologies do not meet the criteria for aggregation due to the lower overall operating income loss of these segments 
the following tables summarize the company s results of operations by segment for  and conmed endosurgery  conmed electrosurgery and conmed linvatec net sales income from operations operating margin product offerings include a complete line of endo mechanical instrumentation for minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures  electrosurgical generators and related surgical instruments  arthroscopic instrumentation for use in orthopedic surgery and small bone  large bone and specialty powered surgical instruments

endosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in the same period a year ago decreased sales approximately million 
on local currency basis  sales increased 
the overall increase in sales is mainly driven by our vcare product which we believe is an innovative product for laparoscopic hysterectomies 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in compared to in the decrease in operating margins is due to lower gross margins percentage points due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  higher research and development spending percentage points due to increased emphasis on our conmed linvatec orthopedic products  and costs associated with the voluntary recall of certain powered instrument products percentage points  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  sales force and other relatively fixed administrative expenses increased points as a percentage of lower overall sales 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points to in compared to in the increase in operating margins are due to higher gross margins percentage points in compared to as result of the newly acquired direct operations in italy and improved manufacturing efficiencies and other decreases in selling and administrative expense percentage points offset by higher selling and administrative expenses associated with the newly acquired direct sales operation in italy percentage points 
conmed patient care net sales income loss from operations operating margin product offerings include a line of vital signs and cardiac monitoring products including pulse oximetry equipment sensors  ecg electrodes and cables  cardiac defibrillation pacing pads and blood pressure cuffs 
we also offer a complete line of reusable surgical patient positioners and suction instruments tubing for use in the operating room  as well as a line of iv products 
patient care sales decreased million in to million compared to million in principally due to decreased sales of suction instruments and ecg electrodes to distributors 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in the same period a year ago accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
on a local currency basis  sales decreased 
we believe the decrease in sales is due to a general slowdown in hospital spending as a result of the weak economic environment 
patient care sales increased million in to million compared to million in on increased sales of defibrillator pads and ecg electrodes 
foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in the same period a year ago did not have a significant impact on sales 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in compared to in the decreases in operating margins are primarily due to decreases in gross margins of percentage points on lower sales volumes in compared to higher selling and relatively fixed administrative costs percentage points accounted for the remaining increase and were offset by decreased research and development spending percentage points on our endotracheal cardiac output monitor ecom project 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points to in compared to in the increases in operating margins are primarily due to increases in gross margins of percentage points in compared to as a result of higher selling prices and lower production variances offset by increased research and development costs percentage points associated with our endotracheal cardiac output monitor ecom project and higher selling and administrative costs percentage points 
conmed endoscopic technologies net sales income loss from operations operating margin product offerings include a comprehensive line of minimally invasive endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic instruments used in procedures which require examination of the digestive tract 
endoscopic technologies net sales declined million in to million from million in principally due to decreased sales of disposable biopsy forceps 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in the same period a year ago accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
on a local currency basis  sales decreased 
we believe the decrease in sales is due to a general slowdown in hospital spending as a result of the weak economic environment 
endoscopic technologies net sales declined million in to million from million in  principally due to decreased sales of forceps and pulmonary products as a result of production and operational issues which resulted in product shortages and backorders during the first half of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in the same period a year ago decreased sales approximately million 
on a local currency basis  sales decreased operating margins as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in from in the decrease in operating margins of percentage points in is primarily due to charges associated with the consolidation of divisional administrative offices from chelmsford  massachusetts to our corporate headquarters in utica  new york percentage points  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase in cost was partially offset by higher gross margins percentage points  lower research and development spending of percentage points and overall lower spending in selling and administrative expenses percentage points as a result of our continued efforts to improve the profitability of the business 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in from in the decrease in operating margins of percentage points in is primarily due to decreases in gross margins of percentage points as a result of increased production costs and pricing pressures as well as higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales percentage points offset by decreased research and development spending as a percentage of sales percentage points and the charge in associated with the closure of a sales office in france percentage points 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments  working capital requirements and payments on indebtedness under our senior credit agreement 
we have historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations  including sales of accounts receivable and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we use term borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit agreement and borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property purchases  to finance our acquisitions 
we also have the ability to raise funds through the sale of stock or we may issue debt through a private placement or public offering 
we generally attempt to minimize our cash balances on hand and use available cash to pay down debt or repurchase our common stock 
operating cash flows our net working capital position was million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in  generated on net income of million in  million in and million in the decline in operating cash flows for is due in part to a million decline in net income compared to in addition  during we reduced sales of accounts receivable under our accounts receivable sales agreement by million  thus reducing operating cash flows by million  or million more than in the previous year 
investing cash flows capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to is due to the completion during the second quarter of of the implementation of an enterprise business software application as well as certain other infrastructure improvements related to our restructuring efforts as more fully described in note and in restructuring below 
during  we purchased our italian distributor the italy acquisition for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the italy acquisition 
the purchase of a business and a purchase price adjustment resulted in payments totaling million in financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities during consisted of the following million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans and employee stock purchase plan see note to the consolidated financial statements  million in borrowings on our revolver under our senior credit agreement  million in repayments of term borrowings under our senior credit agreement  million in repayments on our mortgage notes  a million net change in cash overdrafts  and a million repurchase of our convertible senior subordinated notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the repurchase of the notes 
our million senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
there were million in borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december  our available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  were million with approximately million of the facility set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
there were million in borrowings outstanding on the term loan at december borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility are due and payable on april  the scheduled principal payments on the term loan portion of the senior credit agreement are million annually through december  increasing to million in with the remaining balance outstanding due and payable on april  we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess cash flow as defined in the senior credit agreement 
interest rates on the term loan portion of the senior credit agreement are at libor plus at december  or an alternative base rate  interest rates on the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit agreement are at libor plus or an alternative base rate at december  
for those borrowings where the company elects to use the alternative base rate  the base rate will be the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus  plus a margin of for term loan borrowings or for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are pledged in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement 
the senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restrict dividend payments and the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
we were in full compliance with these covenants and restrictions as of december  we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issuance of equity and asset sales 
we have a mortgage note outstanding in connection with the property and facilities utilized by our conmed linvatec subsidiary bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through june the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage note aggregated million at december  the mortgage note is collateralized by the conmed linvatec property and facilities 
we have outstanding million in convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
during the year ended december   we repurchased and retired million of the notes for million and recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million net of the write off of million in unamortized deferred financing costs and million in unamortized debt discount 
during the year ended december   we repurchased and retired million of the notes for million and recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million net of the write offs of million in unamortized deferred financing costs and million in unamortized debt discount 
the notes represent subordinated unsecured obligations and are convertible under certain circumstances  as defined in the bond indenture  into a combination of cash and conmed common stock 
upon conversion  the holder of each note will receive the conversion value of the note payable in cash up to the principal amount of the note and conmed common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
amounts in excess of the principal amount are at an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of the note which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
as of december   there was no value assigned to the conversion feature because the company s share price was below the conversion price 
the notes mature on november  and are not redeemable by us prior to november  holders of the notes have the right to put to us some or all of the notes for repurchase on november   and and  provided the terms of the indenture are satisfied  we will be required to repurchase those notes 
the notes contain two embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivatives are recorded at fair value in other long term liabilities and changes in their value are recorded through the consolidated statements of operations 
the embedded derivatives have a nominal value  and it is our belief that any change in their fair value would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock  although no more than million may be purchased in any calendar year 
we did not repurchase any shares during in the past  we have financed the repurchases and may finance additional repurchases through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans  from operating cash flow and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
management believes that cash flow from operations  including accounts receivable sales  cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating working capital requirements  debt service  funding of capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in the foreseeable future 
see item business forward looking statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation crc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a bank the purchaser 
the purchaser s share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the purchaser and then to crc  but to the extent that the purchaser s share of collections may be less than the amount of the purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables which have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable  including the purchaser s financing costs to purchase the accounts receivable  were million  million and million  in  and  respectively  and are included in interest expense 
there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements for sale under the accounts receivables sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
to the extent that such collections would not be available to conmed in the form of new receivables purchases  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective october  whereby the purchase commitment was decreased from million to million and extended through october  under otherwise substantially the same terms and conditions 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which requires additional disclosures about the transfer and derecognition of financial assets  eliminates the concept of qualifying special purpose entities  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  as a result of this new guidance  our accounts receivable sales agreement will no longer be permitted to be accounted for as a sale and reduction in accounts receivable beginning in as a result  accounts receivable sold under the agreement will be recorded as additional borrowings rather than as a reduction in accounts receivable 
restructuring during  we completed the first phase of our operational restructuring plan which we had previously announced in the second quarter of the restructuring included the closure of two manufacturing facilities located in the utica  new york area totaling approximately  square feet with manufacturing transferred into either our corporate headquarters location in utica  new york or into a newly constructed leased manufacturing facility in chihuahua  mexico 
in addition  manufacturing previously done by a contract manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico was transferred in house to the chihuahua facility 
finally  certain domestic distribution activities were centralized in a new leased consolidated distribution center in atlanta  georgia 
we believe our restructuring will reduce our cost base by consolidating our utica  new york operations into a single facility and expanding our lower cost mexican operations  as well as improve service to our customers by shipping orders from more centralized distribution centers 
the closure of the two manufacturing facilities  consolidation of distribution activities and the first phase of transitioning manufacturing operations was substantially complete as of december  we expect the completion of the first phase of our operational restructuring plan to yield annual cost savings of approximately million beginning in during  we plan to enter into the second phase of our restructuring plan which contemplates transferring additional production lines from utica  new york to our manufacturing facility in chihuahua  mexico 
we expect to incur million in costs associated with the second phase of our restructuring plan which we expect to yield annual cost savings of approximately million beginning in in conjunction with our restructuring plan  we considered fasb guidance which requires that long lived assets be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
as a result of our restructuring  two manufacturing facilities located in the utica  new york area were closed prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
we determined one facility did not have any value and therefore recorded a million charge for the remaining net book value of the facility in the fourth quarter of we plan to sell or lease the second facility and have tested it for impairment under the guidance for long lived assets to be held and used 
we performed our impairment testing on the second facility by comparing future cash flows expected to be generated by this facility undiscounted and without interest charges against the carrying amount million as of december  
since future cash flows expected to be generated by the second facility exceed its carrying amount  we do not believe any impairment exists at this time 
however  we cannot be certain an impairment charge will not be required in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and as necessary through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk approximately of our total consolidated net sales were to customers outside the united states 
we have sales subsidiaries in a significant number of countries in europe as well as australia  canada and korea 
in those countries in which we have a direct presence  our sales are denominated in the local currency amounting to approximately of our total net sales in the remaining of sales to customers outside the united states was on an export basis and transacted in united states dollars 
because a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products 
during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately million and income before income taxes by approximately million 
we manage our foreign currency transaction risks through the use of forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency transaction exposures 
we account for these forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
to the extent these forward contracts meet hedge accounting criteria  changes in their fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these changes in fair value will be reclassified into earnings as a component of sales when the forecasted transaction occurs 
the notional contract amounts for forward contracts outstanding at december  which have been accounted for as cash flow hedges totaled million 
net realized losses recognized for forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges approximated million for the year ended december  net unrealized gains on forward contracts outstanding which have been accounted for as cash flow hedges and which have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million at december  these unrealized gains will be recognized in income in we also enter into forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars in order to hedge our currency transaction exposures on intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
these forward contracts settle each month at month end  at which time we enter into new forward contracts 
we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges and have not applied hedge accounting to them 
the notional contract amounts for forward contracts outstanding at december  which have not been designated as hedges totaled million 
net realized losses recognized in connection with those forward contracts not accounted for as hedges approximated million for the year ended december   offsetting gains on our intercompany receivables of million for the year ended december  these gains and losses have been recorded in selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we record these forward foreign exchange contracts at fair value  the fair value for forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  was million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding under our senior credit agreement and an additional million in accounts receivable sold under our accounts receivable sales agreement  we are not a party to any interest rate swap agreements as of december  assuming no repayments other than our scheduled term loan payments  if market interest rates for similar borrowings and accounts receivable sales averaged more in than they did in  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates for similar borrowings average less in than they did in  our interest expense would decrease  and income before income taxes would increase by million
