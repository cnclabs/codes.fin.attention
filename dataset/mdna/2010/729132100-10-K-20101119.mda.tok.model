our customers products typically require exceptional production and supply chain flexibility  necessitating an optimized demand pull based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform 
many of our customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe 
in such cases we provide global logistics management and after market service and repair 
our customers products may have stringent requirements for quality  reliability and regulatory compliance 
we offer our customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization  including product specifications  development  design and design verification  regulatory compliance support  prototyping and new product introduction  manufacturing test equipment development  materials sourcing  procurement and supply chain management  product assembly manufacturing  configuration and test  order fulfillment  logistics and service repair

we have tailored our engineering services  manufacturing operations  supply chain management  workforce  business intelligence systems  financial goals and metrics specifically to support these types of programs 
our flexible manufacturing facilities and processes are designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations as well as unique quality and regulatory requirements 
each of these customers is supported by a multi disciplinary customer team and one or more uniquely configured focus factories supported by a supply chain and logistics solution specifically designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness required to support that customer s fulfillment requirements 
our go to market strategy is also tailored to our target market sectors and business strategy 
we have business development and customer management teams that are dedicated to each of the five sectors we serve 
these teams are accountable for understanding the sector participants  technology  unique quality and regulatory requirements and longer term trends in these sectors 
further  these teams help set our strategy for growth in these sectors with a particular focus on expanding the services and value add that we provide to our current customers while strategically targeting select new customers to add to our portfolio 
our financial model is aligned with our business strategy  with our primary focus to earn a return on invested capital roic in excess of our weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the smaller volumes  flexibility requirements and fulfillment needs of our customers typically result in greater investments in inventory than many of our competitors  particularly those that provide ems services for high volume  less complex products with less stringent requirements such as consumer electronics 
in addition  our cost structure relative to these peers includes higher investments in selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales to support our sector based go to market strategy  smaller program sizes  flexibility  and complex quality and regulatory compliance requirements 
by exercising discipline to generate a roic in excess of our wacc  our goal is to ensure that plexus creates a value proposition for our shareholders as well as our customers 
our customers include both industry leading oems and other technology companies that have never manufactured products internally 
as a result of our focus on serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology  our business is influenced by technological trends such as the level and rate of development of telecommunications infrastructure  the expansion of networks and use of the internet 
in addition  the federal food and drug administration s approval of new medical devices  defense procurement practices and other governmental approval and regulatory processes can affect our business 
our business has also benefited from the trend to increased outsourcing by oems 
we provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis  which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly 
we provide some services on a consignment basis  which 
table of contents means that the customer supplies the necessary materials  and we provide the labor and other services required for product assembly 
turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing  in addition to manufacturing  and involve greater resource investments than consignment services 
other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations  we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and risk factors included in part i  item a herein 
executive summary as a consequence of the company s use of a weekly accounting system  periodically an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re align with a fiscal year end at the saturday closest to september in fiscal  this required an additional week  which was added to the first fiscal quarter 
therefore  the comparisons between fiscal and fiscal reflect that fiscal included days while fiscal included days 
fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  from fiscal year to  million 
net sales increased in all of our market sectors during fiscal  except for a slight decrease in the defense security aerospace sector 
the overall higher net sales were driven primarily by stronger end market conditions  as well as the ramp of production for new customer programs in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial  and medical sectors 
these increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from two defense security aerospace sector customers  as well as decreased net sales to juniper networks  inc juniper 
net sales to juniper  our largest customer  declined slightly as a result of decreased end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared favorably to percent for fiscal gross margins in fiscal were higher due to the increased net sales  changes in customer mix and proceeds from a litigation settlement see note  partially offset by increases in variable incentive compensation expense due to strong financial performance as well as fixed expenses as a result of higher headcount 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal sixty percent of the increase was due to higher variable incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remainder of the increase was driven primarily by increased employee compensation expense as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth 
for fiscal  the company did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges as compared to restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in fiscal  as explained below 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared favorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net income increased from the prior year period due to overall increased sales and higher gross margins  offset by increased fixed expenses and selling and administrative expenses 
the effective tax rate in the current year period was percent  which compares unfavorably to the percent tax benefit in the prior year period 
the increase in effective tax rate from the prior year period was primarily due to the mix of the company s fiscal pre tax income and the absence in of a net million tax benefit resulting from a discrete event that occurred in fiscal fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  from fiscal year to  million 
the challenging global economic environment contributed to lower revenues and decreased demand in all five of our end market sectors 
the overall reduction in net sales was driven primarily by decreased demand  resulting from economic conditions and lower end market demand for our customers products  in particular from customers in the industrial commercial  defense security aerospace and wireline networking sectors 
in addition  the inability of our customer to secure additional orders for the product we formerly manufactured for our unnamed defense customer led to decreased demand of million 
net sales in our wireline networking sector declined mainly due to decreased demand from several customers  including juniper  our largest customer 
the impact of overall economic conditions significantly contributed to reduced revenue  gross margin and roic below our normal expectations for the business 
as a result  we took action in the second fiscal quarter of to control costs  including reducing discretionary spending and workforce reductions  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe we took prudent steps to reduce our planned capital expenditures and working capital investments to balance potential future growth with then current results 

table of contents gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared unfavorably to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the decline in net sales and unfavorable changes in customer mix  particularly related to our unnamed defense customer as well as reduced demand from juniper 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal decreased variable incentive compensation of million as compared to fiscal  as well as reductions relating to cost cutting measures  contributed to the decline 
restructuring and asset impairment charges were million in fiscal  related to goodwill impairment in our europe reportable segment  the closure of our ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce across our united states facilities and in juarez 
for fiscal  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  related to the announcement of the closure of our ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce in juarez 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared unfavorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal was favorably impacted by a percent effective tax rate benefit  a decrease from the percent effective tax rate in fiscal  due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays which extend through and  respectively 
other 
the effective income tax rates benefits for fiscal  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the changes in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays 
we received approval from the malaysian investment development authority to extend the tax holiday in malaysia for a period of five years through december   subject to certain conditions 
roic 
one of our metrics for measuring financial performance is after tax roic 
we define after tax roic as tax effected operating income  excluding unusual charges  divided by average capital employed over a rolling five quarter period 
capital employed is defined as equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
roic was percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 
see the table below for our calculation of roic dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  september  operating income tax effected  excluding unusual charges average invested capital after tax roic roic is a non gaap financial measure which should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  measures of the company s financial performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
non gaap financial measures  including roic  are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance 
in particular  we provide roic because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions as well as management s performance under the tests which it sets for itself 
for a reconciliation of roic to our financial statements that were prepared using gaap  see exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal outlook 
our current expectations for fiscal are to continue to capitalize on the ramp of new business wins and a strengthening economy  which should result in improved customer demand 
this should help us achieve our long term goals of compounded annual revenue growth of or more and roic of basis points above our estimated wacc 
we review our internal calculation of wacc annually  and in fiscal reduced our estimate of wacc from to 
this reduction is the result of lower beta for our shares and higher levels of debt in our capital structure  and will become effective for internal use in fiscal based on customer forecasts and current economic conditions  we currently expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million  however  our results will ultimately depend upon the actual level of customer orders and production 
we are experiencing the termination of business relationships with two of our customers  both of which were acquired in fiscal  which we anticipate will adversely affect sales beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we will also be subject to changes in factors affecting the economy as a whole  some of which may differ from our expectations 
assuming that net sales are in the range noted above  we would currently 
table of contents expect to earn  before any restructuring and impairment costs  between to per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately three to five percent due to the mix of pre tax income expected to occur in each tax jurisdiction 
due to significant tax rate differences in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our effective tax rate can change significantly as the relative amount of income earned in these jurisdictions changes 
china and mexico passed new tax laws that were effective on january  also  on november   mexico adopted tax reform legislation that took effect on january  and provides for a temporary increase in its income tax and value added tax rates from to and to  respectively  along with certain other changes 
these new laws have not yet materially impacted our tax rates  but may result in a higher effective tax rate on our operations in future periods 
see risk factors  in part i  item a hereof  which sets forth some of the other factors which could affect our net sales  operations and earnings going forward 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase october  september  increase decrease decrease net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors  except for a slight decrease in the defense security aerospace sector 
the overall higher net sales were driven primarily by strong end market conditions  as well as the addition of new customers in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial and medical sectors 
these net sales increases were offset in part by decreased net sales to two defense security aerospace customers  as well as lower net sales to juniper as a result of a decline in end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
net sales for fiscal decreased percent from fiscal the net sales decline was due to decreased demand from customers in each of our five end market sectors  primarily due to decreased end market demand 
significant decreases were noted in our industrial commercial  defense security aerospace and wireline networking sectors 
in addition  the inability of our customer to secure additional orders for the product we formerly manufactured for our unnamed defense customer led to decreased demand of million 
net sales in our wireline networking sector decreased mainly due to decreased demand from several customers  including juniper  our largest customer 
our net sales percentages by market sector for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  october  september  wireline networking wireless infrastructure medical industrial commercial defense security aerospace 
table of contents the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  october  september  juniper top customers net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements  terminations  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration with our top customers has remained at or above percent during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end market demand and other factors  including global economic conditions 
any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors  we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector 
in the current economic environment  we are seeing increased merger and acquisition activity that has impacted our customers 
specifically  two of our customers were acquired in the first quarter of fiscal our production for these two customers is ramping down during the first half of fiscal and full disengagement is expected 
one of the customers  which generated approximately million of revenue in fiscal  has communicated that they plan to disengage from plexus by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  actual revenue in fiscal with this customer may vary based on the success and speed of their planned transition 
the other customer  which generated approximately million of revenue in fiscal  has communicated plans to disengage over a period of multiple quarters and we are currently forecasting some level of revenue with this customer through fiscal gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase october  september  increase decrease decrease gross profit gross margin for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in all of our reportable segments  driven by strong end market conditions  as well as the addition of new customers in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial and medical sectors  as well as favorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately percent of the increase in gross profit increased capacity utilization from the higher revenue levels proceeds of million received from a litigation settlement  which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales  and partially offset by increased variable compensation expense of approximately million as a result of improved financial performance and fixed expenses  primarily in the united states and asia reportable segments  due to higher headcount to support the revenue growth 

table of contents for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors decreased net sales in three of our four reportable segments us  mexico and europe  particularly related to our largest customer  an unnamed defense customer and another significant customer as well as unfavorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately percent of the decrease in gross profit increased costs related to sites not operating at full capacity  including sites in china  romania  mexico  and wisconsin  this accounted for approximately percent of the decrease  and a decrease in our variable incentive compensation expense  which offset the overall decrease in gross profit by approximately percent 
gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies resulting from the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price reductions  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
we are currently in a constrained supply environment  which has caused  and may continue to cause  periods of parts shortages and delays for some components  based on lack of capacity at some of our suppliers to meet increased demand from the gradually improving economic outlook 
these shortages and delays could negatively impact net sales  inventory levels  component costs and margin 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
although we focus on maintaining gross margins  there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
design work performed by the company is not the proprietary property of plexus and substantially all costs incurred with this work are considered reimbursable by our customers 
we do not track research and development costs that are not reimbursed by our customers and we consider these amounts immaterial 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase october  september  increase decrease decrease s a percent of net sales for fiscal  sixty percent of the increase in s a was due to higher variable incentive compensation expense as a result of strong financial performance 
the remainder of the increase was driven primarily by an increase in headcount to support our revenue growth 
s a as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal as a result of net revenue expanding more quickly than these cost increases 
seventy percent of the decrease in s a for fiscal was due to lower variable incentive compensation expense 
in addition  savings from various other cost cutting measures were partially offset by additional expenses related to expansions in china and romania 
s a as a percentage of net sales increased because these costs did not decline as quickly as net sales did in fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges 
our restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  september  goodwill impairment severance costs adjustments to lease exit costs other total restructuring and asset impairment charges 
table of contents the restructuring and asset impairment charges were associated with various reportable segments 
management excludes such charges when analyzing the performance of the reportable segments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments  including a summary of restructuring and asset impairment charges by reportable segment 
fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal  we did not incur any restructuring or asset impairment charges 
fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  related to goodwill impairment in our europe reportable segment  the closure of our ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce across our facilities in the united states and juarez 
the details of these fiscal restructuring actions are listed below 
goodwill impairment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  writing off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our kelso facility 
the impairment charge was driven by macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the company s offerings from the kelso facility 
these conditions led to an interim triggering event  leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
this test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of million was recorded 
ayer facility closure during the third quarter of fiscal  we closed our ayer facility 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  related to the disposal of certain assets and costs to exit this leased facility 
other restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance at facilities in the united states and juarez 
these workforce reductions affected approximately employees 
we also recorded approximately million of asset impairment charges at corporate 
other income expense 
other income expense for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase october  september  increase decrease decrease other income expense percent of net sales other income expense for fiscal increased million  to million of expense from million of expense in fiscal this change was driven by the unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments of million and reduced interest income of million due to lower effective interest rates  partially offset by decreased interest expense of million  primarily related to servicing the million term loan drawn in april other income expense for fiscal increased million  to million of expense from million of expense in fiscal this change was driven by reduced interest income of million due to lower effective interest rates and increased interest expense of million  primarily related to servicing the million term loan drawn in april miscellaneous income expense fluctuated favorably due primarily to foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  september  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate benefit the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays that extend through and  respectively 
we received approval from the malaysian investment development authority to extend the tax holiday in malaysia for a period of five years through december   subject to certain conditions 
as a result of using the with and without method under the requirements for accounting for stock based compensation  the company recorded a valuation allowance for state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable 
during fiscal and  the company realized a reduction of its state income taxes payable from state net operating loss carryforwards 
consequently  we reversed approximately million and million of this valuation allowance with corresponding credits to additional paid in capital in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a result  we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of october  in addition  there was a remaining valuation allowance of million as of september   related to various state deferred income tax assets for which utilization was uncertain due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in those states 
during fiscal  we added million of valuation allowance primarily related to changes in state laws 
there was no change in the valuation allowance during fiscal  therefore  we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million as of october   related to state deferred income tax assets 
if the us operations continue to generate losses  there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately three to five percent 
china and mexico passed new tax laws that were effective on january  also  on november   mexico adopted tax reform legislation that took effect on january  and provides for a temporary increase in its income tax and value added tax rates from to and to  respectively  along with certain other changes 
these new laws did not materially impact our overall effective income tax rate in fiscal or  but may result in a higher effective tax rate on our operations in future periods 
on november   the united states adopted the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which provides for an increase in the net operating loss carryback period from two years to five years for tax periods beginning or ending in calendar years and  along with certain other tax law changes 
this law did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal and we do not currently believe that it will create a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  our net income increased by million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by percent 
net income decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal  diluted earnings per share decreased percent 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily a result of increased accounts payable as well as earnings after adjusting for the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes  offset in part by increased inventory and accounts receivable 
inventory dollars increased by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory turns decreased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal days in inventory changed unfavorably as of october  to days as compared to days at october  the increase in inventory  both in dollars and 
table of contents days of cash cycle  was the result of additional inventory to support year over year growth and customer demand volatility during the economic recovery 
the industry also experienced parts shortages  extended lead times and allocations as described more fully in risk factors in part i  item ia herein  which increased the amount of inventory that we agreed to hold at the request of our customers to enhance their ability to respond to their end markets and meet customer demand 
as part of our continued efforts to mitigate inventory risk  we have collected approximately million in cash deposits from our customers  which are classified as customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets  and have also continued to work with customers that have excess inventory issues in accordance with contractual obligations 
the overall increase in accounts receivable of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly due to increased net sales 
other factors contributing to the increase in accounts receivable were unfavorable changes in customer terms for a customer in each of the wireline networking and medical sectors as well as an wireline networking customer that prepaid for its accounts in fiscal but elected not to do so in fiscal our annualized days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for fiscal increased unfavorably from days in fiscal to days in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal the primary investments included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  mainly in the united states and asia to support customer demand in those regions and for the construction of a new headquarters facility in neenah  wisconsin 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our capital expenditures by reportable segment 
fiscal purchases of property  plant and equipment included million  million  million and million related to our asia  us  mexico and europe reportable segments  respectively 
on july   the company entered into an agreement to purchase state leasehold land in penang  malaysia for approximately million  subject to various purchase contingencies 
the company began construction of an additional manufacturing facility on the land during early fiscal we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the principal sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal we currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million 
a significant portion of the fiscal capital expenditures is anticipated to be used for the construction of a new manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
we also anticipate beginning construction of facilities in romania and china in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal  primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the payments on our term note and capital leases 
in february  the company negotiated the settlement of a capital lease in kelso  scotland 
the termination of this capital lease obligation and acquisition of the property was effected through a cash payment by plexus of million 
the company did not repurchase any shares in either fiscal or fiscal on april   we entered into our credit agreement the credit facility with a group of banks which allows us to borrow million in term loans and million in revolving loans 
the million in term loans was immediately funded and the million revolving credit facility is currently available 
the credit facility is unsecured and may be increased by an additional million the accordion feature if we have not previously terminated all or any portion of the credit facility  there is no event of default existing under the credit agreement and both we and the administrative agent consent to the increase 
the credit facility expires on april  borrowings under the credit facility may be either through term loans or revolving or swing loans or letter of credit obligations 
as of october   we had term loan borrowings of million outstanding and no revolving borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test  all as defined in the agreement 
as of october   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
if we incur an event of default  as defined in the credit facility including any failure to comply with a financial covenant  the group of banks has the right to terminate the credit facility and all other obligations  and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding sums principal and accrued interest 
the interest rate on the borrowing varies depending upon our then current total leverage ratio  as of october   the company could elect to pay interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus 
rates would increase upon negative changes in specified company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio to no less than libor plus 
table of contents 
we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused credit commitment based on our leverage ratio  the current fee is 
unless the accordion feature is exercised  this fee applies only to the initial million of availability excluding the million of term borrowings 
origination fees and expenses associated with the credit facility totaled approximately million and have been deferred 
these origination fees and expenses will be amortized over the five year term of the credit facility 
quarterly principal repayments on the term loan of million each began june   and end on april   with a final balloon repayment of million 
the credit facility allows for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default including any failure to comply with a financial covenant exists at the time of  or would be caused by  the dividend payment or the share repurchases 
in june  the company entered into three interest rate swap contracts related to the million in term loans under the credit facility that had an initial notional value of million and mature on april  the total fair value of these interest rate swap contracts was million as of october  as of october   the total combined notional amount of the company s three interest rate swaps was million 
our malaysian operations have entered into forward exchange contracts on a rolling basis with a total notional value of million as of october  these forward contracts will fix the exchange rates on foreign currency cash used to pay a portion of our local currency expenses 
the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying condensed balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
the total fair value of the forward contracts was million at october  as of october   we held million of auction rate securities maturing on march   which were classified as other long term assets and whose underlying assets are in guaranteed student loans that are backed by a u 
s 
government agency 
if the credit quality deteriorates for these adjustable rate securities  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe that these securities are marketable and could be sold if we elected to do so 
based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and short term investments  the credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months 
million of committed credit is currently available under the credit facility  with another million available in an accordion facility  which is contingent upon compliance with the credit agreement and lender approval 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  particularly due to the current instability of the credit and financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future 
however  the company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash  which in the future may include share repurchases  a special dividend or recurring dividends 
facility closures expansions in october  we announced our plans to construct a manufacturing facility in oradea  romania which will provide approximately  to  square feet of manufacturing space and replace the  square foot facility that we currently lease

the previous headquarters facility in neenah  wisconsin continues to be utilized primarily for engineering operations 
in february  the company negotiated the settlement of a capital lease in kelso  scotland 
the termination of this capital lease obligation and acquisition of the property was executed through a cash payment of million 
in early fiscal  we purchased a second manufacturing facility in appleton  wisconsin 
the new facility provided an additional  square feet of manufacturing space 
we began manufacturing in this facility in the second half of fiscal in april  we closed our ayer  massachusetts manufacturing facility and transitioned the customer programs to other facilities in our organization 
this decision was the result of our proactive strategic planning process which determined that the ayer facility was not strategically aligned with our future growth prospects and we could provide greater value to its customers by providing services at other plexus locations 
reportable segments a further discussion of our fiscal and financial performance by reportable segment is presented below dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  september  net sales united states asia mexico europe elimination of inter segment sales operating income loss united states asia mexico europe corporate and other costs united states net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase reflected higher end market demand from numerous existing customers in each of our market sectors and demand from new customers in the wireline networking  wireless infrastructure  and medical sectors 
these increases were offset by reduced net sales to our largest customer  juniper  due to the transfer of manufacturing of some products to our asia reportable segment as well as decreased end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
operating income for fiscal increased million from fiscal primarily as a result of higher revenues from the customers noted above  improved operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels and proceeds received from a litigation settlement 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal this decline reflected lower demand  mainly from our unnamed defense security aerospace customer  and the transfer of production for juniper product to our asia reportable segment as well as the decrease in the demand from this customer due to lower end market demand 
operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal primarily as a result of decreased sales and unfavorable changes in customer mix  particularly related to our unnamed defense customer 

table of contents asia net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal this growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors  increased demand from a new customer in the industrial commercial sector and the transfer of the manufacturing of some juniper products to the asia reportable segment from the united states reportable segment  partially offset by the decrease in demand from juniper described above 
operating income improved million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the net sales growth and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal this growth reflected increased net sales to multiple customers  with the most significant customer growth coming from the transfer of production of juniper product from the united states reportable segment to the asia reportable segment as well as increased demand from another customer in the wireline networking sector and a customer in the medical sector 
operating income improved million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher net sales and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
mexico net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the net sales increase was primarily driven by higher end market demand for existing customer programs in the industrial commercial and wireline networking sectors and the ramp of production for one existing customer in the industrial commercial sector  offset by the disengagement of a wireline networking customer 
operating results for the current year improved due to higher net sales volume 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal the net sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased demand from multiple customers across sectors due to lower end market demand  offset by increased demand from a new program in the industrial commercial sector 
operating loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of decreased sales and an unfavorable change in customer mix 
europe net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the change in net sales can be attributed to higher demand from the ramp of production for two existing customer programs in the industrial commercial sector 
operating results were lower in the current year as compared to the prior year due to operating costs from our new romania facility 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal the change in net sales can be attributed to a decrease in exchange rates as well as decreased demand due to lower end market demand from one customer in the industrial commercial sector

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings

as of october   other long term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers  as well as other key employees  and an asset retirement obligation 
we have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately million  as of october   related to unrecognized income tax benefits 
the company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation 
as of october   other long term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the company is terminated without cause as well as a subsequent commitment for approximately million to acquire land in xiamen  china 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  other off balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments that are material 
disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation the financial accounting standard board fasb requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
we used the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the fasb regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions  including future revenue and cash flow projections 

table of contents circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  related to the company s sole goodwill asset 
the impairment wrote off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our kelso facility  which was the sole reporting unit in the europe reportable segment 
the impairment charge was driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the company s offerings from the kelso facility 
these conditions led to an interim triggering event  leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
this test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of million was taken 
should we have goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the future  we would test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less  are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model 
the completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist 
any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity 
in june  the company entered into three interest rate swap contracts related to the million in term loans under the credit facility that had an initial total notional value of million and mature on april  these interest rate swap contracts will pay the company variable interest at the three month libor rate  and the company will pay the counterparties a fixed interest rate 
the fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are  and  respectively 
these interest rate swap contracts were entered into to convert million of the variable rate term loan under the credit facility into fixed rate debt 
based on the terms of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying debt  these interest rate contracts were determined to be effective  and thus qualify as a cash flow hedge 
as such  any changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
any gain or loss on the derivatives will be recorded in the income statement in interest expense 
the total fair value of these interest rate swap contracts was million and million at october  and october   respectively 
the company s malaysian operations have entered into forward exchange contracts on a rolling basis with a total notional value of million as of october  these forward contracts fix the foreign exchange rates on foreign currency cash used to pay a portion of local currency expenses 
the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance 
table of contents sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
the total fair value of the forward contracts was million at october  income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
although our net deferred income tax assets as of october   still reflect a million valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets to offset future taxable income in certain states 
we also had a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of october  if the us operations continue to generate losses  there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets 
new accounting pronouncements see note in notes to consolidated financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
beginning in july  we entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our asia reportable segment  as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs the company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods presented above 
based on the company s overall currency exposure  as of october   a percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for million in term loans as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
as with any agreement of this type  our interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 

table of contents our only material interest rate risk is associated with our credit facility under which we borrowed million on april  through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense 
auction rate securities as of october   we held million of auction rate securities maturing on march   which were classified as long term other assets and whose underlying assets are in guaranteed student loans backed by a us government agency 
if the credit quality deteriorates for these adjustable rate securities  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
the fair value of the auction rate securities approximates the carrying value of million as of october  we believe that these securities are marketable and could be sold if we elected to do so
