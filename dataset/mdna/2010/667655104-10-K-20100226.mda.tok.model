item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s nw natural financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the years ended december    and unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements principally consist of the accounts of nw natural and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nng financial corporation financial corporation and gill ranch storage  llc gill ranch  and an equity investment in a proposed natural gas pipeline 
these accounts include our regulated local gas distribution business  our regulated gas storage business  and other regulated and non regulated investments primarily in energy related businesses 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated local gas distribution segment  and the term non utility is used to describe our gas storage segment gas storage as well as our other regulated and non regulated investments and business activities other segment see outlook strategic opportunities  below  and note in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this section to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
we also show operating revenues and margins excluding the refund of gas cost savings to customers in june and july because we believe it provides a more meaningful comparison of operating revenues and margins between and we use such non gaap ie non generally accepted accounting principles measures in analyzing our financial performance and believe that they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary highlights of consolidated net income and earnings per share increased percent to all time record highs of million and per share  respectively  net operating revenues increased percent to million  operations and maintenance expense increased percent to million  cash flow from operations increased million to million  permits were approved to proceed with the development at gill ranch  and construction began in january  a new five year contract was executed with our union employees  effective in july  and the quarterly common stock dividend was increased percent to cents per share in the fourth quarter of  making this the th consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders 
our primary businesses consist of regulated utility and gas storage operations 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of natural gas  providing distribution services at competitive prices  and being able to recover our operating and capital costs in the rates charged to customers in a reasonable and timely manner 
our utility business is regulated by two state commissions  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
factors critical to the success of our regulated gas storage business include developing and operating storage capacity at competitive market prices  retaining existing customers and successfully marketing available storage capacity to new customers  planning for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve growing demands of its customers  obtaining timely approval of reasonable rate increases  and with respect to future development of gas storage projects  being able to obtain financing to fund future development 
our existing gas storage business rates are approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate customers or the opuc for intrastate customers 
the gill ranch gas storage project currently under development is subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission cpuc see outlook strategic opportunities gas storage development  below 

table of contents outlook in  we intend to remain focused on improving our core businesses  enhancing our strategic position  advancing business development projects related to our primary businesses  and strengthening our organizational effectiveness 
the following is a brief summary of management s plans and objectives in these four areas 
for a detailed discussion of these areas  see issues  challenges and performance measures  and strategic opportunities  below 
business improvements 
we continue to integrate  consolidate and streamline operations using recently implemented new technology improvements  which include an enterprise resource planning system  an automated dispatching system and an automated meter reading system 
these and other new technologies support our operating model 
strategic position 
we remain committed to creating shareholder value while balancing the interests of our customers  employees and the communities we serve 
to create value  we will respond to business challenges and opportunities that lie ahead  including finding innovative solutions to economic and environmental challenges as well as regulatory  business development and workforce challenges and opportunities 
business development 
in addition to exploring new growth opportunities  we intend to continue advancing key natural gas infrastructure investments during  including our gas storage project in california and our gas transmission pipeline project in oregon 
organizational effectiveness 
our employees are our most valued resource 
we intend to support our employees with a positive work environment  on going training opportunities  continued refinement of our organizational structure and new technologies to achieve our goals and facilitate improvements to our operating model 
issues  challenges and performance measures economic weakness 
continued weakness in local and us economies have resulted in reduced consumer demand and business spending 
these conditions may continue to have a negative impact on our financial results  reflecting slower customer growth  reduced industrial margins  increased bad debt expense  and higher pension costs 
most recently  our annual customer growth rate slowed to percent in compared to percent in we expect our customer growth rate in to stabilize near levels  unless economic conditions deteriorate further 
despite challenging market conditions  we believe we are well positioned to continue adding customers due to our relatively low market penetration  our efforts to convert homes to natural gas  and the potential for environmental initiatives that could favor natural gas use in our region 
managing gas prices and supplies 
our gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility customers and to hedge gas prices to effectively manage costs  reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage 
we entered the gas year  that began november   hedged at a targeted level of approximately percent of our estimated gas purchase volumes for the gas contract year  and we believe we have sufficient contracted supplies to meet the needs of our core utility customers 
in addition  we are currently hedged on gas prices for between and percent of our forecasted purchase volumes for the two gas contract years after october  we have board authorization to hedge up to percent of our gas supply requirements for the next gas contract year 
our purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism  along with gas price hedging strategies and gas supplies in storage  enables us to reduce earnings risk exposure to higher gas costs 
in addition to hedging gas prices over the next three years  we are also evaluating and developing other gas acquisition strategies to potentially manage gas price volatility for customers beyond three years 
environmental investigation and remediation costs 
we accrue all material environmental loss contingencies related to our properties that require environmental investigation or remediation 
due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the preliminary nature of investigations or the developing nature of remediation requirements  actual costs could vary significantly from our loss estimates 
as a regulated utility  we are required to defer certain costs pursuant to regulatory decisions by the opuc or wutc  including environmental costs  and to seek recovery of these amounts in future rates to customers 
however  before we can seek recovery from customers  we must pursue recovery from insurance policies 
ultimate recovery of environmental costs  either from regulated utility rates or from insurance  will depend on our ability to effectively manage costs and demonstrate that costs were prudently incurred 
recovery may vary significantly from amounts currently recorded as regulatory assets  and amounts not recovered would be required to be charged to income in the period they were deemed to be unrecoverable 
see note 
table of contents climate change 
we recognize that our businesses are likely to be impacted by future carbon constraints 
the outcome of federal  state  local and international climate change initiatives cannot be determined at this time  but these initiatives could produce a number of results including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
while our co equivalent emission levels are relatively small  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations  could result in an increase in the prices we charge our customers or a decline in the demand for natural gas 
on the other hand  because natural gas is a fossil fuel with a relatively low carbon content  it is also possible that future carbon constraints could create additional demand for natural gas for electric production  direct use in homes and businesses and as a reliable and relatively low emission back up fuel source for alternative energy sources 
strategies and performance measures 
in order to deal with the challenges affecting our business  we annually review and update our strategic plan to map our course over the next several years 
our plan includes strategies for improving our utility gas distribution business  growing our non utility gas storage business  investing in new natural gas infrastructure in the region  and maintaining a leadership role within the natural gas industry by addressing long term energy policies and pursuing business opportunities that support new clean energy technologies 
we intend to measure our performance and monitor progress of certain metrics including  but not limited to earnings per share growth  total shareholder return  return on invested capital  utility return on equity  utility customer satisfaction ratings  utility margin  capital  operations and maintenance expense per customer  and non utility earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non utility ebitda 
strategic opportunities business process improvements 
to address the current economic and competitive challenges  we continue to evaluate and implement business strategies to improve efficiencies 
our goal is to integrate  consolidate and streamline operations and support our employees with new technology tools 
in  we completed the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning erp system  which is designed to reduce the number of technology platforms and improve overall operating efficiencies by integrating systems and data  automating control procedures and workflows  and improving management decision making and financial reporting processes 
in  we also completed our project to automate the reading of gas meters amr 
meters equipped with this new technology electronically transmit usage data to receiving devices located in our vehicles as they drive in the area  substantially reducing the labor costs associated with reading meters 
the total capital cost of this project was approximately million see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms amr deferral  below 
in and  we deployed an automated dispatching system  which provides integrated planning and scheduling with global positioning system capabilities to more effectively collect and distribute data 
we will continue to deploy this new technology in the field during in  we announced a voluntary severance program to reduce staffing levels in response to work load declines related to slower customer growth and efficiency improvements 
severance programs and normal attrition resulted in reductions of full time positions from  at december  to approximately  in early we incurred severance charges in the fourth quarter of approximately million  which were partially offset by savings from vacated positions prior to the end of the year 
we also expect some additional position reductions in  but those reductions will most likely come from normal attrition 

table of contents technology investments  workforce reductions and the other initiatives discussed above are expected to facilitate process improvements  contribute to long term operational efficiencies and reduce operating expenses throughout nw natural 
gas storage development 
in  we entered into a joint project agreement with pacific gas electric company pg e to develop an underground natural gas storage facility near fresno  california 
at that time  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch  to plan and develop the project and to operate the facility 
in july  gill ranch filed an application with the cpuc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn 
in october  we received an order from the cpuc approving our cpcn 
gill ranch s provision of market based rates for storage services in california will be subject to cpuc regulation including  but not limited to  service terms and conditions  tariff compliance  securities issuances  lien grants and sales of property 
our share of the total project development cost is estimated to be between million and million  representing percent of the total cost of the initial development  which includes an estimated total bcf of gas storage capacity and approximately miles of gas transmission pipeline 
in january  we began construction on the gill ranch facility 
the initial development of the gas storage facility at gill ranch is currently targeted to be in service by the end of the third quarter of we are currently in the process of hiring key staff for our non utility gas storage businesses 
while our primary focus for growing the gas storage business is on the current development at gill ranch  we also plan to continue expanding our interstate storage facilities at mist  oregon 
in  we completed three dimensional seismic surveys and initiated engineering work for a new to bcf expansion at mist 
pending successful marketing efforts  we expect to move forward with the project and would target a in service date 
currently  our total cost estimates are between million and million for this expansion project 
this estimated cost range includes the development of a second compression station and a pipeline gathering system that will also enable future storage expansions at mist 
pipeline diversification 
currently  we depend on a single bi directional interstate pipeline to ship gas supplies to our utility distribution system 
palomar gas transmission  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of palomar gas holdings  llc  pgh  is seeking to build a new gas transmission pipeline that would provide a new interconnection with our utility distribution system 
pgh is owned percent by nw natural and percent by gas transmission corporation gtn  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada corporation 
the proposed palomar pipeline is a mile natural gas transmission pipeline in oregon designed to serve our utility and the growing markets in oregon and other parts of the western united states 
the palomar pipeline would be regulated by the ferc 
in december  palomar filed for a cpcn with the ferc 
the palomar project includes an east and west segment 
the east segment would extend approximately miles west from an interconnection with gtn s existing interstate transmission mainline near maupin  oregon to an interconnection with nw natural s gas distribution system near molalla  oregon 
the west segment would then extend approximately miles further west to other potential additional interconnections including a possible connection to one of the two liquefied natural gas lng terminals proposed to be built on the columbia river 
the east segment would not only diversify nw natural s gas delivery options and enhance the reliability of service to our utility customers by providing an alternate transportation path for gas purchases from different regions in western canada and the us rocky mountains  but also provide potential access to other shippers in the region 
the west segment of palomar would provide the region  as well as our utility customers with potential access to a new source of gas supply if an lng terminal is built on the columbia river 
palomar will continue to focus on permitting activities during  and we believe the ferc will issue a draft environmental impact statement during the first quarter of the date for when palomar is expected to go into service will be impacted by the timing of our final ferc permit and the needs of shippers 
in addition  the development of lng terminals along the columbia river may or may not proceed  which may affect the development of the west segment of palomar 
see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below for further discussion on the status of palomar 

table of contents consolidated earnings and dividends net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consolidated returns on average common equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to factors contributing to increased earnings were a million increase in utility net operating revenue margin from our regulatory share of gas cost savings  reflecting a contribution to margin of million in compared to a reduction to margin of million in  a million increase in utility margin from the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  and a million increase in margin from gas storage operations 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to higher expenses for pensions  bonuses  health care benefits and employee severance  a million increase in income tax expense related to higher taxable income and a higher state income tax rate  and a million decrease in utility margin from industrial customers  reflecting weak economic conditions and a decrease in depreciation rates 
compared to factors contributing to decreased earnings were a million loss in utility margin from our regulatory share of gas cost increases in compared to a margin gain of million in from gas cost decreases  a million decrease in utility margin from a lower customer surcharge related to regulatory adjustments for income taxes paid  a million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to increased utility plant in service  a million decrease in margin due to a temporary mark to market gain in  and a million decrease in utility margin from industrial customers due to weaker economic conditions 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in utility margin from higher sales volumes to residential and commercial customers due to colder weather and customer growth  after decoupling and weather mechanism adjustments  a million decrease in operation and maintenance expense  partially due to higher costs in for strategic initiatives  and partially due to lower bonuses and employee benefit costs in  a million decrease in income tax expense due to lower taxable income  a million after tax gain from the sale of our investment in an aircraft leased to a commercial airline  and a million increase in utility margin due to curtailment charges for use by a small number of industrial customers during cold weather 
dividends paid on our common stock were per share in  compared to per share in in october  the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of cents per share  payable on november   increasing the indicated annual dividend rate to per share 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates and judgments include accounting for regulatory cost recovery and amortizations  revenue recognition  derivative instruments and hedging activities  pensions and postretirement benefits  income taxes  and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  authoritative guidance for regulated operations regulatory accounting require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
regulatory accounting requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from  or required to refund them to  customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 
the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting  which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
because we meet all three conditions  we continue to apply regulatory accounting principles for our regulated utility operations 
future accounting changes  regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current accounting  regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
see note  industry regulation 

table of contents revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas deliveries each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to lower volumes in reflecting warmer weather in late december and lower customer rates 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
utility revenues may also include the recognition of a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid 
this revenue reflects an opuc rule whereby we are required to automatically implement a rate refund or a rate surcharge to utility customers 
this refund or surcharge is accrued based on the estimated difference between income taxes paid and income taxes authorized to be collected in rates for further discussion  see results of operations business segments utility operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of service to customers 
revenues from our asset optimization partner are recognized over the life of the optimization contract for the guaranteed amount  and recognized as earned for amounts above the guaranteed amount 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our gas acquisition policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting see note  industry regulation  and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized in current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging see note  derivatives and industry regulation 
our derivative contracts outstanding at december  were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
our estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may have an impact on our results of operations  but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair values on unrealized gains and losses at december  and  see note commodity based derivative contracts entered into by the utility after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
the portion not deferred to a regulatory account pursuant to that sharing agreement is recognized either in current income for contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting or in other comprehensive income for contracts qualifying for hedge accounting 
derivative hedge contracts are subject to a hedge effectiveness test to determine the financial statement treatment of each specific derivative 
as of december   all of our derivatives were effective economic hedges and either qualified or were expected to qualify for regulatory deferral or hedge accounting treatment 
we use the hypothetical derivative method under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging to determine the hedge effectiveness for our interest rate swaps and the dollar offset method for other derivative contracts under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
the effectiveness test applied to financial derivatives is dependent on the type of derivative and its use 

table of contents the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps utility net gain loss on commodity price options utility net gain loss on interest rate swap utility subtotal on commodity utility net gain loss on foreign currency forward purchases utility total realized net gain loss realized gains losses from commodity hedges and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
realized gains losses from interest rate hedges are recorded as reductions increases to interest charges over the term of the underlying debt issuances 
unrealized gains and losses from commodity hedges  foreign currency hedges and interest rate hedges  which reflect quarterly mark to market valuations  are generally not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  and are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees and other postretirement employee benefit plans 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans have plan assets  which are held in a qualified trust to fund retirement benefits 
effective january  and  the qualified defined benefit retirement plans for non union employees and for union employees  respectively  were closed to new participants 
instead  non union and union employees hired or re hired after december  and  respectively  are provided an enhanced retirement k savings plan benefit 
also  effective january   the postretirement welfare benefit plan for non bargaining unit employees was closed to new participants 
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs retirement benefit costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and an expected long term return on plan assets see note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the pension amounts recorded and disclosed 
retirement benefit costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets  if applicable 
the market related asset valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which we recognize over a three year period or less from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in retirement benefit costs 
accounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the retirement benefit costs relating to our qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are recovered in utility rates which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefits  and as such we received approval from the opuc pursuant to regulatory accounting to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery  rather than including it as aoci under common equity see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 

table of contents a number of factors are considered in developing pension and postretirement assumptions  including evaluations of relevant discount rates  an evaluation of expected long term investment returns based on asset classes and target asset allocations  expected changes in salaries and wages  analyses of past retirement plan experience and current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we reviewed and updated our pension and postretirement weighted average discount rate assumptions from percent to percent and from percent to percent  respectively 
the new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of the estimated cash flow  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments  to the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s s p or aa or higher by moody s investors service moody s  our expected annual rate of future compensation increases changed from a range of to percent to a range of to percent  our expected long term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets remained unchanged at percent  and other key assumptions as needed based on actual experience and actuarial recommendations 
at december   our net pension liability benefit obligations less market value of plan assets for the two qualified defined benefit plans decreased by million compared to better than expected investment performance plus a cash contribution of million more than offset the million increase in benefit obligations due to lower discount rates and million increase due to updating other assumptions  thereby resulting in the net decrease to our unfunded pension liability 
the liability for non qualified plans increased million and the liability for other postretirement benefits increased million in we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected return  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
as of december   the actual annualized returns on plan assets  net of management fees  for the past one year  five years  years and since december were percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following shows the sensitivity of our retirement benefit costs and benefit obligations to future changes in certain actuarial assumptions impact on impact on retirement change in retirement benefit obligations thousands  except percent assumption benefit costs at dec 
 discount rate qualified defined benefit plans non qualified plans other postretirement benefits expected long term return on plan assets qualified defined benefit plans n a the impact of a change in retirement benefit costs on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because only between and percent of our pension costs is charged to operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining to percent is capitalized to construction accounts as payroll overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
at december  and  our net long term deferred tax liability totaled million and million  respectively 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our tax returns 
for state income tax and local income taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance due to our expectation that all of these assets will be realized 
these accounting standards also require the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability see note  income tax expense 
we received authorization from the opuc and wutc in to accelerate the recovery of these pre regulatory assets through future utility rates see regulatory accounting  above  and notes and 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that require management s assessment of the expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until such positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we would not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and would report the tax effect as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had no uncertain tax positions 
the internal revenue service irs is currently examining our through consolidated federal income tax returns 
the irs completed its last examination of the through audit cycle in the second quarter of completion of the through federal income tax returns is expected during interest and penalties  if any  related to any future income tax deficiencies will be recorded within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal defense costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable  and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to environmental liabilities and related costs we develop estimates based on a review of information available from recently completed studies and negotiations involving several sites 
using sampling data  feasibility studies  existing technology and enacted laws and regulations  we estimate that the total future expenditures for environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation are million as of december  it is our policy to accrue the full amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable liability 
when information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability  or when only the range of probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another  then it is our policy to accrue at the lower end of the range 
accordingly  due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several site investigations  the range of potential loss beyond the amounts currently accrued  and the probabilities thereof  cannot be reasonably estimated 
therefore  we have recorded the liabilities at an amount that reflects the most likely estimate or the low end of the range 

table of contents we will continue to seek recovery of such costs through insurance and through customer rates  and we believe recovery of these costs is probable 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made see note results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates and systems of accounts by the opuc  the wutc  ferc  and with respect to gill ranch  the cpuc 
the opuc and wutc and  with respect to gill ranch  the cpuc  also regulate our issuance of securities 
in  approximately percent of our utility gas volumes were delivered to  and utility operating revenues were derived from  oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the oregon and washington economies in general  and by the pace of growth in the residential and commercial markets in particular  and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases oregon 
in our most recent general rate increase in oregon  which was effective in september  the opuc authorized rates to customers based on a return on common stock equity roe of percent 
in  in connection with the renewal of our conservation tariff and weather normalization rate mechanism  the opuc approved a stipulation that restricts us from filing a general rate case with the opuc prior to september   subject to certain exceptions 
under the agreement  we would be allowed to file a general rate case if an extraordinary event occurs or significant investments are required on behalf of our customers and we are unable to reach agreement regarding alternative forms of cost recovery outside of a general rate case 
these exceptions might include additional investments in our pipeline integrity management program 
this agreement does not impact our ability to file annual rate adjustments to reflect changes in gas purchase costs under our pga mechanism or our ability to collect or refund prior year s gas cost deferrals 
see rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
washington 
in december  an all party stipulated agreement regarding our washington general rate case was approved by the wutc 
as part of the stipulation  the wutc authorized rates to our customers based on a roe of percent  which is included as part of an overall rate of return on total invested capital of percent 
these new customer rates went into effect on january  under these rates  our annual revenue requirements increased by approximately million  or percent 
we are reviewing recent decisions regarding decoupling mechanisms in washington and considering whether to request approval for a decoupling mechanism 
federal 
we are required under our mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every three years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services 
we filed a cost and revenue study and an associated petition for rate approval in april as a result of that proceeding  the current maximum cost based rates for our interstate gas storage services were approved by ferc in august  with our maximum rates unchanged from the levels approved by ferc in the maximum cost based rates are designed to reflect updated costs related to the further development of the mist gas storage facility from to additionally  we made a filing in december to obtain ferc approval to revise the depreciation rates associated with mist assets used to derive the cost based interstate storage rates to match the depreciation rates for the same assets that were recently adjusted under state regulation 
we did not file to make any changes to the previously approved maximum rates 
ferc approved the depreciation rate filing in may we are required to make our next cost and revenue study filing at ferc on or before december  
table of contents california 
to date  we have not filed any rate cases or storage service tariffs with the cpuc 
later in  we expect to file a storage service tariff with the cpuc with respect to gill ranch 
rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are established each year under pga mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases  including gas storage  gas purchases hedged with financial derivatives  interstate pipeline demand charges  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
in october  the opuc and wutc approved rate changes effective on november  under our pga mechanisms 
the effect of the rate changes was to decrease the average monthly bills of oregon residential customers by percent  partially offset by an increase in the public purpose charge  which resulted in a net decrease of percent 
the average monthly bills of washington residential customers decreased by percent 
under the current oregon pga incentive sharing mechanism  we are required to select by august of each year either an percent deferral or percent deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to pga prices such that the impact on current earnings from the gas cost incentive sharing is either percent or percent  respectively 
in addition to the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  we are also subject to an annual earnings review to determine if the utility is earning over an allowed threshold 
if utility earnings exceed a specific earnings threshold level  then percent of the amount above the threshold will be deferred for refund to customers 
under this provision  if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
we selected the percent deferral option for the pga year 
in august  we selected percent deferral for the pga year 
the earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down depending on movements in long term interest rates 
in and  the earnings threshold after adjustment for long term interest rates was percent and percent  respectively 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a result of the utility earnings review  and we do not expect that any amounts will be required to be refunded to customers as a result of the earnings review  which will be approved by the opuc during the second quarter of there has been no change to the washington pga mechanism under which we defer percent of the higher or lower actual purchased gas costs and pass that difference through to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
we do not have an earnings sharing mechanism in washington 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff  which is a rate mechanism designed to adjust margin for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between utility earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers  removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers conservation efforts 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of our utility revenues 
the oregon conservation tariff includes two components a price elasticity adjustment  which adjusts rates annually for increases or decreases from expected customer volumes due to annual changes in commodity costs or periodic changes in our general rates  and a conservation adjustment calculated on a monthly basis to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes also referred to as the decoupling adjustment 
the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account  which is included in the next year s annual pga filing 
baseline consumption was determined by customer consumption data used in the oregon general rate case and is adjusted annually for customer growth and the effect of the price elasticity adjustment discussed above 
see results of operations business segments utility operations  below 

table of contents in  an independent study to measure the effectiveness of oregon s conservation tariff mechanism recommended continuation of the tariff with minor modifications  which the opuc approved 
in september  the opuc extended our conservation tariff through october weather normalization 
in oregon  the opuc approved our use of a weather normalization mechanism through october this mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather  with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average 
the mechanism is applied to our residential and commercial customers bills between december and may of each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see business segments utility operations  below 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for our washington customers  which account for about percent of our utility revenues 
regulatory and insurance recovery for environmental costs 
the opuc has authorized us to defer environmental costs associated with certain named sites and to accrue interest on deferred environmental cost balances  subject to an annual demonstration that we have maximized our insurance recovery or made substantial progress in securing insurance recovery for unrecovered environmental expenses 
these authorizations have been extended through january we have requested another extension through january  and that request is currently pending 
see note industrial tariffs 
the opuc and wutc have approved tariffs covering service to our major industrial customers  including terms which are intended to give us certainty in the level of gas supplies we will need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the terms include an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes and a requirement that industrial customers under our annual pga cost of gas tariff complete the term of their service election 
system integrity program 
in  the opuc approved specific accounting treatment and cost recovery for our transmission pipeline integrity management program  a program mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and the related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 
we record these costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each month period ending september  and recover the revenue requirement associated with the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga in oregon 
the phmsa also had proposed a distribution integrity management program 
in february  the opuc approved a stipulated agreement to create a new  consolidated system integrity program sip 
the sip integrates the existing transmission pipeline and proposed distribution pipeline integrity management programs into a single program 
in december  the phmsa issued the final rule for distribution integrity management programs 
our sip costs are tracked into rates annually  with rate recovery after the first million of capital costs 
an annual cap for expenditures has been set at million  but extraordinary costs above the cap may be approved with written consent of the opuc and other interested parties 
the sip allows recovery of costs incurred  as discussed above  in oregon during the period from october through october  or until the effective date of new rates adopted in our next general rate case 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for sip costs incurred in the state of washington 
amr deferral 
in  we completed a project to automate the reading of our oregon customers gas meters 
the capital cost of this amr project was approximately million 
in february  the opuc approved a stipulation that allows us to defer the revenue requirement associated with the amr project and amortize that deferral subject to an annual earnings test 
we are permitted to recover the deferral amount as long as our roe during the earnings review period does not exceed our authorized roe 
earnings or losses from our pga gas cost incentive sharing mechanism are not included for purposes of this earnings test 
recovery of any deferred amounts will begin in november as part of our annual pga rate adjustment 

table of contents depreciation study 
the opuc and wutc approved our filed depreciation study and our request to change the amortization of our regulatory tax asset account balance on pre plant 
these approvals specifically authorized the implementation of new depreciation rates in oregon and washington  with a corresponding decrease to customer billing rates effective january  see consolidated operations depreciation and amortization  below 
the new regulatory tax amortization schedule on pre assets  with a corresponding increase to customer rates  became effective january  in washington and november  in oregon 
the implementation of the new rates decreases depreciation expense and increases income tax expense  both of which are offset on an annualized basis by a corresponding change in utility operating revenues 
ferc also approved the application of these new depreciation rates for our interstate gas storage assets in may  and the new rates were made effective as of january  customer refunds for gas cost incentive sharing 
for the period between november  and march   our actual gas costs were significantly lower than the gas costs embedded in customer rates 
as a result  percent of the gas cost savings attributed to oregon and percent of the savings attributed to washington were recorded to a regulatory account for refund to customers see purchased gas adjustment  above 
ordinarily  these refunds would be included in customer rates in the next year s pga filing  but in we received special regulatory approval to refund the accumulated gas cost savings early to our oregon and washington customers 
in june and july  we refunded a total of million to our oregon customers and million to our washington customers through billing credits 
pension deferral 
we are currently subject to a regulatory deferral order from the opuc whereby we must refund cost savings to customers when our annual pension expense is below the amount set for rate recovery in our last general rate case 
however  we are currently not authorized to defer and recover any cost increases from customers when our annual pension expense is above the amount set in rates 
for  our annual pension expense is expected to be significantly above the amount set in rates  and we may seek some form of regulatory relief for pension expenses between now and our next general rate case 
business segments utility operations our utility margin results are affected by customer growth and to a certain extent by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff that adjusts revenues to offset changes in margin resulting from increases or decreases in residential and commercial customer consumption 
we also have a weather normalization mechanism that adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in margin resulting from above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the major factor contributing to the increase in utility margin was a million increase in our gas cost incentive sharing from lower gas prices 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in decreased by percent over last year due to the effects of warmer weather on residential and commercial use and the effects of a weak economy on commercial and industrial use 
margin was reduced by million in compared to due to a customer rate decrease which corresponded to a decrease in depreciation rates and expense effective january  excluding the impact of lower depreciation rates on revenues  our margin from residential and commercial customers increased by million in  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
industrial margin declined million  but would have decreased by million if the depreciation rate impact was excluded 
the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid also increased margin by million compared to  primarily due to the cost of gas savings in our weather normalization mechanism reduced residential and commercial margin by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to a reduction of million for the year ended december  when weather was percent colder than average 
our decoupling mechanism increased residential and commercial margin by million in  after adjusting for expected price elasticity impacts from higher pga prices effective november   compared to a margin increase of million in compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in utility margin of million or percent even though margins from residential and commercial customers contributed an additional million in  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms while margin from industrial customers declined by million 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in increased by percent over due to colder weather and percent customer growth 
the major factors contributing to the decline in utility margin were the million decrease in our regulatory incentive sharing from higher gas costs  a million decrease in the regulatory adjustments for income taxes paid and a million decrease in margin from industrial customers due to weak economic conditions 

table of contents our weather normalization mechanism offset residential and commercial margin gains by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to an offset of million for the year ended december   based on weather that was percent colder than average in our decoupling mechanism recovered million of residential and commercial margin losses in  after adjusting for expected price elasticity impacts from higher pga prices effective november   compared to a margin recovery of million in the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the years ended december   and favorable unfavorable thousands except degree day and customer data vs

table of contents in june and july  we refunded gas cost savings totaling million to our oregon and washington customers 
the following non gaap table summarizes the impact of this refund on our operating revenues  cost of gas sold and margin for the year ended december   along with a comparison to the years ended december  and we believe this non gaap financial calculation enables the reader of the financial statements to better understand our operating revenues  cost of gas and utility margin performance from management s perspective in addition to the traditional gaap presentation 
thousands as reported refund excluding refund non gaap utility operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial firm sales industrial firm transportation industrial interruptible sales industrial interruptible transportation regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid other revenue total utility operating revenues cost of gas sold revenue taxes utility margin the non gaap information disclosed above reconciles to the preceding table summarizing utility margin for the year ended december  residential and commercial sales residential and commercial sales are impacted by customer growth  seasonal weather patterns  energy prices  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service areas 
typically  percent or more of our annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced due to our weather normalization mechanism in oregon where about percent of our customers are served 
this mechanism is effective for the period from december through may of each heating season 
approximately percent of our eligible oregon customers have opted out of the mechanism 
in oregon  we also have a conservation decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between our earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers  so that we do not have an incentive to encourage greater consumption and undermine oregon s conservation policy and efforts 
in washington  where the remaining percent of our customers are served  we do not have a weather normalization or a conservation decoupling mechanism 
as a result  we are not fully insulated from earnings volatility due to weather and conservation in washington 
the primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are customer growth  seasonal weather patterns  competition from other energy sources  economic conditions and to a certain extent the volatility of gas prices 
compared to operating revenues in decreased million or percent primarily due to million in customer refunds for gas cost savings  partially offset by customer rate increases of and percent in oregon and washington  respectively  effective november   and customer growth of percent  volumes were percent lower  primarily reflecting percent warmer weather  customer conservation and weak economic conditions  and sales margin was percent lower due to lower volumes and customer rate decreases related to lower depreciation expense  but that was partially offset by the decoupling adjustment that recovers margin from lower use per customer 

table of contents compared to operating revenues in increased percent on a percent increase in volumes due to percent colder weather and percent customer growth  partially offset by customer rate decreases of to percent over the first months of  and sales margin was percent higher  reflecting increased volumes from customer growth and from colder weather  but that was largely offset by the weather normalization adjustment that credits customer bills when weather is colder than normal 
industrial sales and transportation industrial operating revenues include the commodity cost component of gas sold under sales service but not under transportation service 
therefore  industrial customer switching between sales service and transportation service can cause swings in operating revenues but generally our margins are unaffected because we do not mark up the cost of gas 
as such  we believe margin is a better measure of performance for the industrial sector 
the primary factors that impact margin from industrial sales and transportation markets are as follows compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers decreased million therms  or percent  reflecting reduced usage likely due to weak economic conditions  and margin decreased million  or percent  reflecting a weak economy and customer rate decreases related to lower depreciation expense and lower volumes  but that was partially offset by fixed charges not affected by declining use 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  or less than percent  reflecting a reduction in sales volumes of million therms offset by an increase in transportation volumes of million therms  and margin decreased million  or percent  reflecting a shift from higher margin to lower margin rate schedules  but this decrease was partially offset by a margin gain of million from curtailment charges assessed to a small number of customers who were out of compliance during a cold weather episode in december several large industrial customers transferred from sales service to transportation service in and changes in natural gas prices can result in a number of our large industrial customers switching between transportation service  where they arrange for their own supplies through independent third parties  to sales service  where we sell them the gas commodity under regulatory tariffs 
in such cases  our tariff requires us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred  if any  to serve those customers so that the cost does not adversely impact our margins or the prices our core customers pay 
regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid oregon law requires regulated natural gas and electric utilities to annually review the amount of income taxes collected in rates from utility operation and compare it to the amount the utility actually pays to taxing authorities 
under this law  if we pay less in income taxes than we collect from our oregon utility customers  or if our consolidated taxes paid are less than the taxes we collect from our oregon utility customers  then we are required to refund the excess to our oregon utility customers 
conversely  if we pay more income taxes than we actually collect from our oregon utility customers  as set forth under our most recent general rate case  then we are required to collect a surcharge from our oregon utility customers 

table of contents for the and tax years  the opuc approved our tax filings to recover million and million  respectively  through a surcharge to our oregon utility customers 
it was agreed that the surcharge  plus accrued interest  would be collected in a one time charge to customers in june it was also agreed that the surcharge  plus accrued interest  would be collected over a one year period beginning june  for the tax year  we anticipate that the difference between income taxes paid and the amounts collected in rates will be greater than  and in accordance with the rules  we have estimated a surcharge of million excluding interest 
both the and surcharges were primarily driven by higher income taxes paid on gains from gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism 
the following table summarizes the total adjustment for income taxes paid as recognized in our results of operations for the year ended december  thousands surcharge interest total tax year tax year tax year total adjustment for income taxes paid other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts other than deferrals relating to gas costs 
other revenues increased net operating revenues by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues in were million lower than in primarily reflecting a million surcharge for the rate adjustment from income taxes paid and million decrease in curtailment charges  partially offset by a million refund to utility customers related to the gas storage regulatory sharing mechanism 
compared to other revenues in were million higher than in primarily reflecting a million refund to utility customers related to the gas storage regulatory sharing mechanism  partially offset by a million surcharge for the rate adjustment from income taxes paid 
cost of gas sold the cost of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains and losses from commodity hedges  pipeline demand charges  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
our regulated utility does not generally earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases 
the opuc and the wutc require the natural gas commodity cost to be billed to customers at the same cost incurred or expected to be incurred by the utility 
however  under the pga mechanism in oregon  our net income is affected by differences between actual and expected purchased gas costs primarily due to market fluctuations and volatility affecting unhedged purchases see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
we use natural gas derivatives  primarily fixed price commodity swaps  consistent with our financial derivatives policies to help manage our exposure to rising gas prices 
gains and losses from financial hedge contracts are generally included in our pga prices and normally do not impact net income as the hedges are usually percent passed through to customers in annual rate changes  subject to a regulatory prudency review 
however  utility gas hedges entered into after the annual pga filing in oregon may impact net income to the extent of our share of any gain or loss under the pga 
in washington  percent of the actual gas costs  including hedge gains and losses  are passed through in customer rates see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above  and note 

table of contents compared to total cost of gas sold decreased million  or percent  primarily due to reduced sales volumes and credits for customer refunds  the average gas cost collected through rates decreased percent from cents per therm in to cents per therm in  primarily reflecting the reduction to cost of gas sold from our customer refund in  partially offset by our to percent pga rate increases effective november   and net losses totaling million were realized from our financial hedges and included in cost of gas sold  compared to million of net hedge gains in compared to total cost of gas sold increased million or percent  due to increased sales volumes  the average cost of gas sold decreased percent from cents per therm in to cents in  primarily reflecting our to percent pga rate decreases effective november  and our to percent increases effective november   and net gains of million were realized from our financial hedges and included in cost of gas sold  compared to million of net losses in in and  our actual gas costs were significantly lower than gas costs embedded in rates  but in our actual gas costs were higher than the gas costs embedded in rates

business segments other than utility operations gas storage our gas storage segment primarily consists of the non utility portion of our mist underground storage facility  utility and non utility asset optimization and gill ranch 
in  we earned million  or cents per share  from our gas storage business segment  after regulatory sharing and income taxes 
this compares to net income of million  or cents per share  in and million  or cents per share  in in oregon  we retain percent of the pre tax income from gas storage services as well as from optimization services when the costs of the capacity being used is not included in utility rates  or percent of the pre tax income from such storage and optimization services when the capacity being used is included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for refund to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from gas storage and optimization services 
in  we announced a joint project with pg e to develop a new underground natural gas storage facility at gill ranch near fresno  california 
we formed a subsidiary of nw natural to develop and operate the facility 
gill ranch will initially own percent of the project  and pg e will own percent 
as of december  and  total assets at gill ranch were million and million  respectively 
see note other our other business segment consists of financial corporation  an equity investment in palomar and other non utility investments and business activities 
financial corporation had total assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  and our investment balance in palomar was million and million  respectively 
the asset balance at financial corporation reflects a non controlling interest in the kelso beaver pipeline 
the balance in palomar reflects our equity investment to date in a proposed mile transmission pipeline 
net income from our other business segment for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

see note 
table of contents consolidated operations operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased by million in  or percent higher than  while was million  or percent lower than in  operations and maintenance expense included increased costs for pensions  health care  bonuses and a severance program 
the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to an million increase in pension expense primarily due to lower assumed discount rates and a decrease in our plans funded status  which resulted from a significant decline in the market value of assets during  a million increase in employee labor and benefit expense due to higher health care premiums and higher bonuses related to above target operating results  which affect annual incentive payments and compensation  a million charge related to our voluntary severance program involving workforce reductions during the third and fourth quarters of a million increase in strategic initiatives including performance improvement and corporate tax projects  and a million increase in utility uncollectible expense see discussion below 
partially offsetting the above increases were a million decrease in employee compensation expense related to reduced employee count  and a million decrease in claims in compared to a million decrease due to additional costs incurred in for strategic initiatives including maintenance projects  training and promotional and safety campaigns  and a million decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense  primarily due to lower bonuses related to lower operating results which affected annual and long term incentives 
partially offsetting the above decreases were a million increase in costs related to serving a growing customer base and increased operating expenses during the december cold weather episode  and a million  or percent  increase in uncollectible expense reflecting higher revenues due to rate increases and sales volume increases 
our bad debt expense ratio as a percent of revenues was percent for  compared to percent in due to the weak economy and high unemployment rates  we were seeing a slight increase in delinquent balances and customers on payment plans  partially offset by an increase in low income energy assistance funds available for customers and refunds of gas cost savings in june and july of also  we have a rate mechanism that covers the increase in bad debt expense directly related to increases in commodity costs 
under our pga mechanism  billing rates are adjusted each year to recover the expected increase or decrease in bad debt expense due to the higher cost of natural gas 
the revenue adjustment for bad debt expense is based on our average write off rate over the last three years multiplied by the estimated increase in commodity costs 
in  margin revenues increased by approximately million to partially offset the expected increase in bad debt expense

we have been involved in litigation with the oregon department of revenue odor over whether natural gas inventories and appliance inventories held for resale are required to be taxed as personal property 
this was appealed to and presented before the oregon supreme court in in january  the oregon supreme court unanimously ruled in our favor  stating that these inventories were exempt from property tax 
the odor has until march  to file a motion for reconsideration with the oregon supreme court 
we are entitled to a refund of approximately million  plus accrued interest  for property taxes paid on gas inventories beginning with the tax year and appliance inventories beginning with the tax year 
we will recognize this gain as income in

for the tax year  the slightly lower effective tax rate was primarily the result of a higher non taxable gain on company owned life insurance 
for more information on our income taxes  including a reconciliation between the statutory federal and state income tax rates and the effective rate  see note and note in july  the governor of oregon signed house bill establishing increases in the state income tax rate for corporations 
by referendum  oregon voters approved this legislation in january the corporate income tax rate in oregon for and will increase from percent to percent for corporations with taxable income over  for tax years and  the income tax rate will decrease to percent  and for years after the tax rate will return to the current percent  except for corporations with taxable income over million the tax rate will remain at percent 
the new tax rates are retroactive to january  following existing guidance on income taxes  we re measured our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  resulting in an adjustment to increase the balance by million 
approximately million of the adjustment was attributed to our utility operations 
as we anticipate future recovery in rates  we recorded a million regulatory asset for the grossed up revenue requirement 
with respect to our non utility business segments  a million adjustment was charged to income tax expense 

table of contents financial condition capital structure our goal is to maintain a strong consolidated capital structure  generally consisting of to percent common stock equity and to percent long term and short term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to fund long term debt redemption requirements and short term commercial paper maturities see liquidity and capital resources  below  and notes and 
achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows for the years ended december  and common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  short term liquidity is provided by cash balances  internal cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes  unsecured credit facilities with multi year commitments  see credit agreement  below  an ability to borrow from cash surrender value in company owned life insurance policies  and proceeds from the sale of long term debt 
we use long term debt proceeds primarily to finance capital expenditures and refinance maturing short term and long term debt 
our current senior secured long term debt ratings are aa from s p and a from moody s 
most recently  s p downgraded our corporate credit rating to a from aa  but at the same time reaffirmed our senior secured long term debt rating at aa and our senior unsecured rating at a 
previously  moody s had upgraded our long term senior secured debt rating from a to a in august our short term debt ratings are a from s p and p from moody s 
both s p and moody s have assigned a stable outlook to our debt ratings 
over the last months  the capital markets have experienced significant volatility and tight credit conditions  but conditions have improved recently as reflected by tighter credit spreads and increased access to new financing for investment grade issuers 
with our current debt ratings  we have been able to issue commercial paper and long term debt at attractive rates and have not needed to borrow from our million back up facility 
in the event that we are not able to issue new debt due to market conditions  we expect that our near term liquidity needs can be met by using cash balances or drawing upon our committed credit facility see credit agreement  below 
we also have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt or equity securities  subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals 
we have opuc approval to issue up to million of additional mtns under our shelf registration statement 
our senior unsecured long term debt ratings are a and a from s p and moody s  respectively 
in the event that our senior unsecured long term debt credit ratings are downgraded  or our outstanding derivative position exceeds a certain credit threshold  our counterparties under derivative contracts could require us to post cash  a letter of credit or other form of collateral  which could expose us to additional cash requirements and may trigger significant increases in short term borrowings 
if the credit risk related contingent features underlying these contracts were triggered on december   we would be required to post approximately million of collateral to our counterparties  but that would assume our long term debt ratings were at non investment grade levels  a level that is significantly lower than our current ratings 
based on several factors  including our current credit ratings  our recent experience issuing commercial paper  our current cash reserves  our committed credit facilities and other liquidity resources  and our expected ability to issue long term debt and equity securities under our universal shelf registration statement  we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet our anticipated near term cash requirements  including all contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 

table of contents dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock each year since the stock was first issued to the public in annual common dividend payments per share  adjusted for stock splits  have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock is within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
our board of directors expects to continue paying cash dividends on common stock on a quarterly basis 
however  the declarations and amount of future dividends will be dependent upon our earnings  cash flows  financial condition and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements except for certain lease and purchase commitments see contractual obligations  below  we have no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table shows our contractual obligations at december  by maturity and type of obligation 
payments due in years ending december  thousands thereafter total commercial paper long term debt maturities interest on long term debt postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases gas purchase contracts gas pipeline commitments other purchase commitments total the majority of postretirement benefit payment obligations are related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans  which are funded by plan assets and future cash contributions 
see note all gas purchase contracts use price formulas tied to monthly index prices 
commitment amounts are based on index prices at december  other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders 
these and other contractual obligations are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
at december   of our utility employees were members of the office and professional employees international union  local no 
in july  our union employees ratified a new five year labor agreement called the joint accord 
the agreement included a percent average wage increase effective june   and a scheduled percent wage increase each year thereafter with the potential for up to an additional percent per year based on wage inflation and other factors 
the joint accord also maintains competitive health benefits while limiting the cost increases for these benefits to the same level as the annual wage increases  and provides increased job flexibility along with the ability for the company to use short term unpaid leave to temporarily adjust the workforce without layoffs 
the joint accord continues our defined benefit retirement plan for existing employees  but closes the plan to new employees hired after december  the term of the new joint accord extends to may   and thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents short term debt our primary source of short term liquidity is from internal cash flows and the sale of commercial paper notes 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet seasonal working capital requirements  including the financing of gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may be used to temporarily fund capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our outstanding commercial paper  which is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement  is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities see credit agreement  below 
our commercial paper program did not experience any liquidity disruptions as a result of the credit problems that affected issuers of asset backed commercial paper and certain other commercial paper programs in and at december  and  our utility had commercial paper outstanding of million and million  respectively 
this year s outstanding commercial paper balances were lower than last year s primarily due to the refinancing of short term debt with long term debt issuances 
in march  gill ranch entered into a cash collateralized credit facility for up to million that has been extended until september  as of december   gill ranch had million of borrowings outstanding included under short term debt on the balance sheet  with a corresponding cash collateral amount included under restricted cash current on the balance sheet 
the effective interest rate on gill ranch s credit facility is percent 
credit agreement we have a syndicated multi year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling million  which may be extended for additional one year periods subject to lender approval 
all lenders agreed to extend their obligations for an additional one year period to may  all lenders under our credit agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of december  as follows amount committed lender rating  by category in thousands aaa aaa aa aa a a  bbb baa total based on credit market conditions  it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency 
however  based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness  including a review of capital ratios  credit default swap spreads and credit ratings  we believe the risk of lender default is minimal 
as discussed above  we extended commitments with all seven lenders under the syndicated credit agreement  with commitments totaling million  to may  the credit agreement also allows us to request increases in the total commitment amount from time to time  up to a maximum amount of million  and to replace any lenders who decline to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the applicable total borrowing commitment 
any principal and unpaid interest owed on borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on or before the maturity date 
there were no outstanding balances under this credit agreement at december  and the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december  and  with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of percent  and percent  respectively 

table of contents the syndicated credit agreement also requires that we maintain credit ratings with s p and moody s and notify the lenders of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our debt ratings is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement 
however  a change in our debt rating below bbb or baa would require additional approval from the opuc prior to issuance of debt  and interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreement are tied to debt ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreement when ratings are changed see credit ratings  below 
credit ratings the table below summarizes our current credit ratings from two rating agencies  s p and moody s 
s p moody s commercial paper short term debt a p senior secured long term debt aa a senior unsecured long term debt a a ratings outlook stable stable the above credit ratings are dependent upon a number of factors  both qualitative and quantitative  and are subject to change at any time 
the disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold nw natural securities 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
redemptions of long term debt we redeemed mtns during  and as follows thousands redeemed in redeemed in redeemed in medium term notes series b due series b due series b due series b due in november one investor in our percent secured mtns due exercised its right under a one time put option to redeem million of the million outstanding 
this one time put option has now expired  and the remaining million principal outstanding is expected to be redeemed at maturity in november 
table of contents cash flows operating activities compared to year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily affected by net income  changes in working capital requirements and other cash and non cash adjustments to operating results 
in  cash flow from net income and operating activity adjustments  excluding working capital changes  increased million compared to working capital changes in increased million compared to the same period in the overall change in cash flow from operating activities was an increase of million 
the significant factors contributing to the cash flow changes between and are as follows an increase of million from deferred gas cost savings reflecting lower actual gas prices compared to gas prices collected in customer rates in  net of amounts already refunded to customers see below  an increase of million from decreases in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue primarily due to the collection of higher balances in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances at year end  an increase of million from income tax refunds received from a change in tax accounting method for certain repairs and maintenance costs see below  an increase of million related to the net decrease in gas inventory balances due to the higher price of gas injected into storage in  an increase of million from accounts payable  reflecting lower gas prices at the end of compared to  a decrease of million related to our pension contributions in to reduce our unfunded liability  a decrease of million from deferred income taxes  reflecting the approved tax deduction for repair and maintenance costs see below  and a decrease of million related to the loss realized on the settlement of our interest rate hedge in compared to in  cash flow from net income and operating activity adjustments  excluding working capital changes  decreased million compared to working capital changes in decreased cash flow by million compared to the majority of these working capital changes  particularly those related to accounts receivable  unbilled revenues inventories  income taxes receivable and accounts payable  reversed early in reflecting changes in seasonal working capital 
the overall change in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was a decrease of million 
the significant factors contributing to the cash flow changes between and are as follows an increase of million in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits primarily from additional accelerated depreciation and a net operating loss see note  a decrease of million in deferred gas costs  million in accounts payable and million in inventories  primarily due to the higher gas cost prices in compared to  a decrease of million in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue due to the colder weather in december and our november  rate increase see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above  and a decrease of million in income taxes receivable primarily due to bonus depreciation and an estimate for a future pension contribution  for which we saw an increase in deferred income taxes 
in june and july of  we refunded an aggregate million from a regulatory liability account to our oregon and washington customers for the customers share of accumulated gas cost savings from november  through march  this reduction in cash was only part of the gas cost savings accumulated from lower gas prices during the gas contract year 
additional savings for customers have accumulated since march   and these amounts are being refunded to customers through lower rates starting november  in december  we filed an application with the irs requesting a change in our tax accounting method to expense routine repair and maintenance costs for gas pipelines that are currently being capitalized and depreciated for book purposes 
the irs consented to our request in august  and we recognized a tax deduction of approximately million on our tax return  which resulted in a federal tax refund of approximately million during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents at december   we reported an estimated net operating loss nol for federal and oregon income tax purposes of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the effects of accelerated tax depreciation provided by the economic stimulus act 
as a result of the change in our tax accounting method for repair and maintenance costs discussed above as well as our increased pension contribution  our nol for federal and oregon income tax purposes was million and million on our federal and oregon tax returns  respectively 
the federal nol was carried back to for a refund of taxes paid in prior years  while the oregon nol has been carried forward to reduce current and future taxable income 
we anticipate that we will be able to use all loss carryforwards in future years 
the oregon nol would expire in if not used in earlier years 
in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of act was signed into law 
this act provides a percent bonus depreciation deduction for qualified property acquired or constructed and placed in service in we estimate that the bonus depreciation deduction will defer the payment of approximately million of federal income taxes during to future periods 
we have lease and purchase commitments relating to our operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations see contractual obligations  above and note 
investing activities cash requirements for investing activities in totaled million  an increase of million from million in cash requirements for the acquisition and construction of our utility plant were million in  down from million in the decrease is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures from lower customer growth in new construction and reduced system expansion costs 
cash requirements for investments in non utility property were million in  primarily related to investments in gill ranch  compared to million in cash proceeds of million from the sale of our investment in a boeing aircraft were used to partially offset our investments in non utility activities last year 
we added million to restricted cash balances in  which collateralizes equipment purchase contracts and bank loans for gill ranch  as compared to million in cash provided by other investing activities in totaled million compared to cash used of million in the change in is primarily due to a net recovery of capital costs in the amount of million from palomar in compared to million of cash contributions to palomar in  and million in proceeds from life insurance collected in compared to million in in  utility capital expenditures are estimated to be between and million  and non utility capital investments are expected to be between million and million for business development projects that are currently in process see outlook  above 
over the five year period through  utility capital expenditures are estimated at between and million  reflecting continued customer growth  gas storage development at mist  technology improvements and utility system improvements  including requirements under the pipeline safety improvement act of most of the required funds for utility capital expenditures and mist expansion are expected to be internally generated over the five year period  and any remaining funding will be obtained through the issuance of long term debt or equity securities  with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
under this shelf registration  we can issue either debt or equity securities 
we expect to file a new shelf registration statement during as of december   the remaining balance of unused financing available and approved by the opuc under the current shelf registration was million 
our funding of the total remaining cost for the current development at gill ranch project is estimated to be between million and million 
as of december   we have invested million of equity funds in gill ranch 
the remaining project cost is expected to be met from a combination of equity funds and debt  which will be non recourse to nw natural 
we have not pledged any of our utility assets  nor have we provided any parent guarantees  toward gill ranch s obligations 
in  palomar will continue to work on the planning and permitting phase of the pipeline project 
the total cost for planning and permitting is estimated to be between million and million  of which our ownership interest is percent 
as of december   we have invested million 
the total cost estimate for the entire mile pipeline  if constructed  is estimated to be between million and million  with our current percent share estimated at between million and million 
the initial planning and developing costs will be financed with equity funds from us and our partner  transcanada 
see outlook  above 

table of contents the palomar pipeline project includes both an east and west segment 
palomar intends to proceed with the construction of the west segment of the pipeline if an lng terminal is developed 
however  the development of lng terminals along the columbia river may or may not proceed  dependent upon a variety of factors  including obtaining state and federal permits  securing acceptable financing and economic conditions 
palomar had executed precedent agreements whereby a significant majority of the pipeline capacity was committed to one shipper 
in april  palomar and that shipper replaced their existing precedent agreement with a new agreement for the same amount of capacity and palomar received million of cash proceeds which had supported the shipper s obligations under the prior agreement 
the cash proceeds received were applied against project costs 
under the precedent agreement now in effect  the shipper currently provides an alternate form of credit support  which is expected to support a portion of the ongoing planning and permitting costs as the project develops 
in addition  palomar has the right to request additional credit support from the shipper at future stages of development 
a failure to provide acceptable ongoing credit support to meet the shipper s obligations may result in palomar reassessing its commitment to the development of the west segment 
based on an ongoing review of the palomar pipeline project  and continuing interest expressed by the majority shipper  as well as interest expressed by other potential shippers  pgh believes that the palomar project is still viable  particularly the east segment 
palomar has binding precedent agreements with two shippers  including our own utility  which represents a majority of the current design capacity on the pipeline 
palomar has also been discussing precedent agreements with other potential shippers for the east segment in particular  should some of that capacity be available 
we will continue to manage project risks  evaluate project costs and assess the fair value of our investment on a quarterly basis  including a valuation of the available credit support 
additionally  pgh will continue to evaluate market conditions and project status to determine if and when to proceed with construction of all or some portion of the project

pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans pension costs are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits  above 
pension costs for our two qualified defined benefit plans  which are allocated between operations and maintenance expense and capital accounts based on employee payroll distributions  totaled million in  an increase of million over the fair market value of the assets in these two plans increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to a positive return on plan assets of million and a million employer contribution  partially offset by benefit payments of million 
we make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarial assumptions and estimates  tax regulations and funding requirements under federal law

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and weather risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into spot  short term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated pipeline transportation contracts  to manage our commodity supply risk 
historically  we have arranged for physical delivery of an adequate supply of gas  including gas in storage facilities  to meet the expected requirements of our core utility customers 
our gas purchase contracts are primarily index based and subject to monthly re pricing  a strategy that is intended to reflect market price trends during the upcoming year 
our pga mechanisms in oregon and washington provide for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  we currently absorb percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retain percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
commodity price risk natural gas commodity prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion  potential market speculation and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price financial swap and option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed or capped prices 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing for recovery  subject to a regulatory prudence review 
at december  and  notional amounts under these financial hedge contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
if all of the commodity based financial hedge contracts had been settled on december   a loss of about million would have been realized and recorded to a deferred regulatory account see note 
we monitor the liquidity of our financial hedge contracts 
based on the existing open interest in the contracts held  we believe existing contracts to be liquid 
all of our financial hedge contracts settle by or are extendible to october  the million unrealized loss is an estimate of future cash flows based on forward market prices that are expected to be paid as follows million in the next month period  and million thereafter 
the amount realized will change based on market prices at the time contract settlements are fixed 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is primarily managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  options and other hedging instruments  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   all foreign currency forward contracts mature within one year 
if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a gain of million would have been realized see note 
credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers at liquid exchange points 
we evaluate and monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds  in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price tied to liquid exchange points  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value at december   our overall credit exposure relating to commodity hedge contracts reflects an amount owed to our finance derivative counterparties of million 
our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have at least an investment grade credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and specific limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
due to current market conditions and credit concerns  we continue to enforce strong credit requirements 
we actively monitor our derivative credit exposure and place counterparties on hold for trading purposes or require cash collateral  letters of credit or guarantees as circumstances warrant 
our actual derivative credit exposure  which reflects amounts that financial derivative counterparties owe to us  is million  and these are under contracts that expire or are expected to settle on or before october  the following table summarizes our overall credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of the s p or moody s rating or a middle rating if the entity is split rated with more than one rating level difference financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands dec 
 dec 
 aaa aaa aa aa a a  bbb baa total to mitigate the credit risk of financial derivatives we have master netting arrangements with our counterparties that provide for making or receiving net cash settlements 
generally  transactions of the same type in the same currency that have a settlement on the same day with a single counterparty are netted and a single payment is delivered or received depending on which party is due funds 
additionally we have master contracts in place with each of our derivative counterparties that include provisions for posting or calling for collateral 
generally we can obtain cash or marketable securities as collateral with one day s notice 
we use various collateral management strategies to reduce liquidity risk 
the collateral provisions vary by counterparty but are not expected to result in the significant posting of collateral  if any 
we have performed stress tests on the portfolio and concluded that the liquidity risk from collateral calls is not material 
our derivative credit exposure is primarily with investment grade counterparties rated aa aa or higher 
contracts are diversified across counterparties to reduce credit and liquidity risk 

table of contents credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental damage claims 
we regularly monitor the financial condition of insurance companies who provide general liability insurance policy coverage to nw natural and its predecessors with respect to environmental damage claims 
we have filed claims for our environmental costs with nine insurance companies  of which six have credit ratings of a or better from am best co 
am best 
am best is a global independent credit rating agency who has provided quantitative and qualitative analysis of insurance company balance sheet strength for over years 
am best uses a rating scale that ranges from a superior financial strength to f in liquidation  with a rating of a considered excellent 
a strong credit rating from am best is not a guaranty that an insurance company will be able to meet its contractual obligations 
the three insurance companies who do not have credit ratings of a or better are expected to have sufficient funds in reserves to cover these claims 
our credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental claims  which reflects amounts we believe are owed to us  could be material 
in the event we are unable to recover environmental expenses from these insurance policies  we will seek recovery of unreimbursed amounts through customer rates 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect gas usage based on average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   approximately percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers
