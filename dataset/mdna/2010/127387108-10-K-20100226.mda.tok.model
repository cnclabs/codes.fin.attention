table of contents marketing and sales we generally market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers 
applications engineers provide technical pre sales and post sales support for software products 
due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process  the sales cycle is generally long  requiring three to six months or more 
during the sales cycle  our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations  product demonstrations and support for on site customer evaluation of our solutions 
we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services  including advertising  direct mail  trade shows  public relations and the internet 
we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales 
all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels 
with respect to international sales  we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries 
we also use a third party distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 
software licensing arrangements we sell software using three license types subscription  term and perpetual 
customers who prefer to license technology for a specified  limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license  and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license 
customers who desire to use new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license  which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a when and if available basis  as opposed to a term or perpetual license  which does not include rights to use new technology 
payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net days 
we offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses called eda cards 
eda cards have an overall face value amount that customers draw down against as they select specific products that are priced based on the particular duration of use the customer desires 
the selection and licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an automated on line system 
the card expires when all of the face value is consumed  or on the pre determined expiration date  whichever comes first 
there are two types of eda cards 
an eda gold card is a term license that enables a customer to access a predetermined list of existing products 
an eda platinum card is a subscription license that enables a customer to access existing and new technology 
for a further description of our license agreements  revenue recognition policies and results of operations  please refer to the discussion under the heading critical accounting estimates under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our backlog as of january  was approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion as of january  backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after january  from a variety of license types  which generally include  but are not limited to subscription licenses for software products  sale or lease of hardware  maintenance contracts on hardware and software products  orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after january   licenses with payments that are outside our customary terms  and the undelivered portion of engineering services contracts 
the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components 
historically  we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers 
however  we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services contracts  deferring revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date 
changes in customer license types or payment terms also can 
table of contents impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we currently expect approximately of our fiscal revenue to come from our backlog as of january  revenue seasonality historically  revenue has been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter  with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year 
however  our license mix has changed such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition 
although we still expect the first quarter to remain our lowest quarter for revenue within a fiscal year  we do not expect the decrease in revenue from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the following year to be as significant as it has been historically 
research and development our investment in research and development was million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal the primary areas of our research and development include soc design  the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range  high performance ic packaging  sip and pcb design  system level modeling and verification  high performance logic verification technology and hardware software co verification 
the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity  so we make significant investments in enhancing our current products  as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 
our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization  to develop  acquire or operate with new products from third parties  and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity  quality  predictability and cost requirements on a schedule that keeps pace with our customers technical developments and industry standards 
manufacturing and software distribution we perform final assembly and testing of our hardware verification  acceleration and emulation products at our headquarters in san jose  california 
subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies  including all individual pcbs and custom ics  and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 
software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 
proprietary technology our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and other intellectual property in the future 
as part of performing engineering services for customers  our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties  including that of our competitors 
competition we compete in the eda industry for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation  inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies  with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products  and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies 
we generally compete on the basis of product quality  product features  level of integration or compatibility with other tools  price  payment terms and maintenance offerings 

table of contents our maintenance business flows directly from our product business 
the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially similar to those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract  and once we have entered into a product contract  maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases  as and when they are made available  and other continued support 
certain competitive factors in the engineering services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses 
while we do compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business  our principal competitors are independent engineering service businesses 
these companies vary greatly in focus  geographic location  capability  cost structure and pricing 
in addition  manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors  including us  because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 
we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog  digital and mixed signal ics and socs 
it is our strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 
international operations we have sales offices  design centers and research and development facilities  approximately half of which are located outside of the united states 
we consider customer sales and support requirements  the availability of a skilled workforce  and costs and efficiencies  among other relative benefits  when determining what operations to locate internationally 
for additional information regarding our international operations  see the discussion under the heading the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition under item a  risk factors and note to our consolidated financial statements 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  individuals  with approximately  in sales  services  marketing  support and manufacturing activities  approximately  in product research and development and approximately in management  administration and finance 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages 
we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors our business faces many risks 
described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
risks related to our business we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries  and any downturn in these industries may reduce our orders and revenue 
purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies 
the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries experienced significant challenges in and the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both these industries and their customers products 
as in the past  the economic downturn in and was characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
although estimates project moderate growth for the semiconductor industry in  we believe that increased spending on eda and other tools may grow more slowly than the semiconductor industry as a whole in the economic downturn in the industries we serve has contributed to the reduction in our revenue in the past and could continue to adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have experienced varied operating results  and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products  fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied operating results 
in particular  we incurred net losses during fiscal and fiscal  and we expect to incur a net loss during fiscal various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control 
our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of certain orders for our software products 
our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period 
we license software using three different license types subscription  term and perpetual 
product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period  whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license 
revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings 
in addition  revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals  the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms  changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie  perpetual  term or subscription for existing customers 
these changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 
our license mix has changed such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition  and we expect the change in license mix  combined with the slow growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector  may make it difficult for us to increase our revenue 
we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels 
these expenses and the impact of long term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term 
in addition  revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment 
a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these expenses in response to short term business changes 
generally  the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter 
this makes it difficult to estimate with accuracy how much business will be executed before the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to 
table of contents the volume or complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the quarter  or due to operational matters regarding particular agreements  we may not finish processing or ship products under some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter  which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular period 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting estimates under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 
you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance 
if our revenue  operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays  customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses or supplier modifications 
as a result of the challenging economic environment  our customers  who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector  have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and  as a result  may delay or default on their payment obligations  file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products  and our suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  although these obligations are generally not cancelable 
our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments 
payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
because of the high volatility driving material fluctuations in asset prices  the capital and credit markets have contracted  and if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults  we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all  which  may have a material negative impact on our business 
our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 
the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments  changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
currently  the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends migration to nanometer design when the size of process features and features  such as wires  transistors and contacts on ics  continuously shrink due to the ongoing advances in the semiconductor manufacturing processes represents a major challenge for participants in the semiconductor industry  from ic design and design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself 
shrinkage of transistor length to such proportions is challenging the industry in the application of more complex physics and chemistry that is needed to realize advanced silicon devices 
for eda tools  models of each component s electrical properties and behavior become more complex as do requisite analysis  design and verification capabilities 
novel design tools and methodologies must be invented quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges 
the challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to work with older  less risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows 
the ability to design socs increases the complexity of managing a design that  at the lowest level  is represented by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask 
in addition  socs typically incorporate 
table of contents microprocessors and digital signal processors that are programmed with software  requiring simultaneous design of the ic and the related software embedded on the ic 
with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity  there is an increase in design reuse  or the combining of off the shelf design ip with custom logic to create ics 
the unavailability of high quality design ip that can be reliably incorporated into a customer s design with our ic implementation products and services could reduce demand for our products and services 
increased technological capability of the field programmable gate array  which is a programmable logic chip  creates an alternative to ic implementation for some electronics companies 
this could reduce demand for our ic implementation products and services 
a growing number of low cost engineering services businesses could reduce the need for some ic companies to invest in eda products 
if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends  we may lose our competitive position  and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete 
to compete successfully  we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries 
we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software  hardware platforms and customer preferences 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 
our stock price has been subject to significant fluctuations  and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to announcements of our quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with earlier projections or the expectations of our securities analysts or investors  changes in our orders  revenue or earnings estimates  announcements of a restructuring plan  changes in management  a gain or loss of a significant customer or market segment share  announcements of new products or acquisitions of new technologies by us  our competitors or our customers  and market conditions in the ic  electronics systems and semiconductor industries 
in addition  equity markets in general  and technology companies equities in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 
we are currently  and in the future may be  involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property  mergers and acquisitions  licensing  contracts  distribution arrangements and employee relations matters 
we are also currently engaged in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged  please refer to the discussion under item  legal proceedings 
we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management s time and attention from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

table of contents our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products  renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license  service and maintenance revenues 
in future periods  customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance 
in some cases  maintenance is renewable annually at a customer s option  and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services  or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements  our revenue could decrease  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our customers  many of which are large semiconductor companies  often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us 
mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services  and in some cases  increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers  including us 
we depend upon our management team and key employees  and our failure to attract  train  motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 
our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees  including key development personnel 
from time to time  there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers  and as a result  we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees  customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 
competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense  particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area  where our principal offices are located  and the other locations where we maintain facilities 
to attract  retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise  we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock based incentive awards  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense  and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses  which could harm our operating results 
the high cost of training new employees  not fully utilizing these employees  or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 
in addition  the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans  including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans  and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions 
these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future 
to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans  and our restructuring plans may not result in the expected benefits we have anticipated  possibly having a negative affect on our future operating results 
during fiscal and fiscal  we initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities 
we may not be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans  such as improvements in operating margins and cash flows  in the restructuring periods contemplated 
the restructuring plans have involved and may continue to involve higher costs or a longer timetable than we currently anticipate or may fail to improve our operating results as we anticipate 
our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations 
our restructuring plans have caused us and will cause us to incur substantial costs related to severance and other employee related costs 
our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses 
in addition  our restructuring plans may have other consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  a negative impact on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees and our competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage over us 
the restructuring plans could also cause our 
table of contents remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees  and  in turn  this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 
we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
developing eda technology and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive  and these investments often require a long time to generate returns 
our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position 
however  we cannot predict that we will receive significant  if any  revenue from these investments 
the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 
the eda industry and the commercial electronics engineering services industry are highly competitive 
if we fail to compete successfully in these industries  it could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
to compete in these industries  we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive eda products  integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner 
we must also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer better strategic concepts  technical solutions  prices and response time  or a combination of these factors  than those of our competitors and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries 
factors that could affect our ability to succeed include the development by others of competitive eda products or platforms and engineering services  possibly resulting in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decrease revenue  decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering services internally  rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity  the challenges of developing or acquiring externally developed technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the requirements of next generation design challenges  the significant number of current and potential competitors in the eda industry and the low cost of entry  intense competition to attract acquisition targets  possibly making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all  and the combination of or collaboration among many eda companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could individually 
we compete in the eda products market with synopsys  inc  magma design automation  inc and mentor graphics corporation 
we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies  with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products  and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies 
manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase engineering services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 
we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 
the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products  we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully 
any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations 
these practices could  over time  
table of contents significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending  then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction  we may not consummate any particular transaction  but may nonetheless incur significant costs  or if a transaction is consummated  we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively 
in addition  acquisitions involve a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs when we acquire another business  it could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired business  the discovery  after completion of the acquisition  of unanticipated liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired  such that we cannot realize the anticipated value of the acquisition  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the failure to retain key employees of the acquired business  difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with us  possibly dissuading them from licensing or buying products acquired by us after the effective date of the license  and the failure to understand and compete effectively in markets where we have limited experience 
in a number of our previously completed acquisitions  we have agreed to make future payments  either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments  or earnouts  based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses 
we may use earnouts for acquisitions in the future 
the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified orders  revenue  run rate  product proliferation  product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition 
future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business  grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 
the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition 
while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations  our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 
we rely on our proprietary technology  as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties  and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  third parties have tried in the past  and may try in the future  to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these safeguards 
the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages 
patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be 
table of contents sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states 
the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
moreover  the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future 
our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties  including that of our competitors 
our failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights  could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate 
it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others 
as a result  from time to time  we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer s rights 
intellectual property infringement claims  regardless of merit  could consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation  or cause product shipment delays  all of which could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
in settling these claims  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may not have terms favorable to us 
being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following pay damages including the potential for treble damages  license fees or royalties including royalties for past periods to the party claiming infringement  stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign the challenged technology  which could be time consuming and costly  or not be accomplished 
if we were compelled to take any of these actions  our business or operating results may suffer 
if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data  our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 
our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  litigation and potential liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

table of contents the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
generally  we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer 
the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education  evaluation and approval process 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers competitive evaluation processes  or customers budgetary constraints and budget cycles 
long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control  including insufficient  excess or obsolete inventory  variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter 
this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter 
also  because of the timing of large orders and our customers buying patterns  we may not learn of orders shortfalls  revenue shortfalls  earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter 
these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly  which can cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles 
united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
in addition  the sec has announced a multi year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings 
any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately during fiscal  during fiscal and during fiscal we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
we also transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions  most notably the japanese yen  european union euro  british pound and indian rupee have had  and may in the future have  a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
for example  when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar  it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change 
if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change 
if we price our products and services in united states dollars  the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency 
this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
on the other hand  when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar  it takes more united states 
table of contents dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency 
as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations  this results in an increase in operating expenses 
exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries 
a subsidiary s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations  including product pricing  expenses and borrowings 
although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 
our international operations may also be subject to other risks  including the adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions  limitations on repatriation of earnings  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  recessions in foreign economies  longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  and united states and other governments licensing requirements for exports  which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products 
we have offices throughout the world  including key research and development facilities outside of the united states 
our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world 
activities that interfere with our international connectivity  such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems  could significantly interfere with our business operations 
our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  including potential united states and international tax reforms  earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the united states federal and state statutory tax rates  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including certain stock based compensation and impairment of goodwill  changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition  derecognition  or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period  increases to interest expenses classified in the financial statements as income taxes  new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards  a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the united states  or results of tax examinations by the internal revenue service  or irs  and state and foreign tax authorities 
any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

table of contents we have received examination reports from the irs proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns  and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns  and the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years through in july  the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and issued a revenue agent s report  or rar  in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately million 
in november  the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period to approximately million 
the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period 
the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately million 
the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income 
we have filed a timely protest with the irs and are seeking resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs  or the appeals office 
in may  the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and issued a rar  in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate deficiency for the three year period of approximately million 
in august  the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period to approximately million 
the irs is contesting our transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and deductions for foreign trade income 
the irs made similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in prior examinations and may make similar claims in its examinations of other tax years 
we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office 
we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments 
the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency  but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved 
interest is compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by the irs and have been between and since the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes  we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations 
however  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
in addition  we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination  we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 
forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty  and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 
forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss  the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets  the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits 
to forecast our global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated based on such estimates 
forecasts of annual income or loss that are near break even will cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense 
if our estimate of the pre tax profit and losses  the mix of our profits and losses  our ability to use deferred tax assets  the results of tax audits  or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates  our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 
we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals 
although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far  any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity  each of which has its own specifications 
because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of customers  loss of market segment share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problem  loss of or delay in revenue  increased service costs  and liability for damages 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed employees  incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 
companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets 
these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 
our corporate headquarters  including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities  is located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known to experience seismic activity 
if significant seismic activity were to occur  our operations may be interrupted  which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states  and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 
we maintain international research and development and other facilities  some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states 
consequently  we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically 
furthermore  this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad 
we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

table of contents risks related to our securities and indebtedness our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition  and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 
we have a substantial level of debt 
as of january   we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of million as follows million related to our convertible senior notes due december  or the notes  million related to our convertible senior notes due december  or the notes and  together with the notes  the convertible senior notes  and million related to our zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due  or the notes 
the level of our current or future indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt as described below  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations or for developments or acquisitions of new technologies  make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  impose operating or financial covenants on us  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
while we are not currently a party to any loans that would prohibit us from making payment on our outstanding convertible notes  we are not prevented by the terms of the convertible notes from entering into other loans that could prohibit such payments 
if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness  we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment  or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions 
if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings  we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness 
any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness  which could  in turn  constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well 
we have in the past and may in the future attempt to access the capital or credit markets in order to obtain funding to meet particular capital or liquidity needs 
the capital and credit markets have contracted and  when compounded by the difficult economic environment and our lower levels of business  we may not be able to secure additional funding on terms acceptable to us or at all  which may adversely impact our business and operating results 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us and potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 
on the first day of fiscal  we retrospectively adopted new accounting principles as required by the debt with conversion and other options subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification  and adjusted all periods for which the convertible senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption 
this adoption had an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  particularly with respect to interest expense ratios 
table of contents commonly referred to by lenders  and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
conversion of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
the terms of the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock 
the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement  which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium  if any  in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount  calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant trading day observation period 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest  except in limited circumstances 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
each  of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december  in the case of the notes and december  in the case of the notes  in each case only if the price of our common stock reaches during certain periods of time specified in the convertible senior notes  specified corporate transactions occur  or the trading price of the convertible senior notes falls below of the product of i the last reported sale price of our common stock and ii the conversion rate on that date 
from november   in the case of the notes  and november   in the case of the notes  and until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes  holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
as of january   none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 
although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently per share  we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes 
however  we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution 
in addition  the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 
at the option of the holders of the convertible senior notes  under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes in cash or shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the convertible senior notes  we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes following a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure  such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities  prior to maturity of the convertible senior notes 
the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash 
this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

table of contents hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes may affect the value of our common stock 
we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions  at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes  with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes 
we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions 
in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions  these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock 
these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock  other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and  as a result  the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes 
in addition  subject to movement in the price of our common stock  if the hedge transactions settle in our favor  we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party 
if the financial institutions with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail or default  our ability to settle on these transactions could be harmed or delayed 
rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 
we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated 
however  if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors  or reduces such rating in the future  the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed 
should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result  as compared to the price of our common stock  this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 
anti takeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company 
for example our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue  at any time and without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as it may determine 
no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding 
however  the rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning or more of its voting stock  or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination  for a period of three years from the date the person became a owner  unless specified conditions are met 
all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist  delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

concurrently with the sale  we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings for two years 
the lease term ended in january  and we have vacated the leased buildings 
we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries 
we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring plans

item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property  mergers and acquisitions  licensing  contracts  distribution arrangements and employee relations matters 
at least quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties  and the outcomes are difficult to predict 
because of such uncertainties  accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 
during fiscal  three complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  all alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder  on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of cadence s common stock

business overview we develop eda software and hardware 
we license software  sell or lease hardware technology  provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics 
our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems 
during fiscal  we had orders of million 
we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software  selling or leasing our hardware technology  providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services 
substantially all of our revenue is generated from ic manufacturers and designers and electronics systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects 
as a result  our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
at least quarterly  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
for information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer  delivery of all specified products has occurred  the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable  at the outset of the arrangement  and collectibility of the fee is probable 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable  and that judgment can impact the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period 
we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession 
our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products 
table of contents or services 
however  we have concluded that fees are not fixed or determinable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries 
for installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment  we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments  when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses  revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable and are collectible 
such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable 
significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment 
if we were unable to determine that collection is probable  such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a multiple element arrangement  or mea  is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products  software license types  services  training or maintenance in a single arrangement 
from time to time  we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer 
we obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are  in substance  a mea 
significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single arrangement 
for our subscription licenses  including eda platinum cards  the software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products  the right to maintenance  and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee  when and if available  during the term of the license agreement 
under these license agreements  when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the first product 
subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue 
the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in the sale of similar term license arrangements 
in the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  we recognize revenue at the lesser of i the pro rata portion of the license fee for the applicable period  or ii as payments from the customer become due if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
for term and perpetual licenses  including eda gold cards  when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met  software license fees are recognized as revenue  generally with product fees associated with the specified products recognized up front upon completion of delivery  and with the maintenance fees recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
under our current business model  a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up front basis 
license agreements under which software fees are recognized up front do not include the right to receive unspecified future software products 
however  in the event such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer  the licenses together may be deemed a mea  in which event all such revenue would be recognized over multiple periods 
revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method  as work is performed  or on the percentage of completion method 
for contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees  we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all 
table of contents revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method 
we also apply a two step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified 
for example  a company s current year or previous year losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
for the years ended january  and january   we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence 
if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
for additional description of the valuation allowance  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
as of january   we had recognized a deferred tax liability of million related 
table of contents to million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the united states 
to calculate the tax liability for the repatriation of these earnings  we are required to estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend withholding tax rates  the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and the potential outcomes of current and future tax audits 
changes in our actual or projected operating results  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  foreign exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions  which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer s payment trends  are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
as a result of our assessment of increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations  we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to million as of january   as compared to million as of january  results of operations overview of fiscal our fiscal financial results reflected the following continuing pressures on the research and development budgets in our customer base that are used to license  purchase or lease eda products or services  lower business levels due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers  lower business levels and up front revenue recognized due to our transition to a license mix with a higher proportion of ratable revenue  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  decreased costs throughout the company as a result of our restructuring plans and other expense reductions  an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers  as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations  and our retrospective adoption of new accounting principles  as required by the debt with conversion and other options subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification  increasing interest expense for all periods presented 
revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software  selling or leasing our hardware technology  providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services 
we principally utilize three license types subscription  term and perpetual 
the different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products  such as the right to access new technology  the duration of the license  and payment timing 

table of contents the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of orders executed in any given period 
for some orders  such as subscription orders  product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods 
in addition  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of particular orders  we have some orders where product and maintenance revenue is recognized as payments become due and some where revenue is only recognized when payment is received 
for other orders  all product revenue is recognized up front in the same quarter in which the order is executed 
we seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately of the total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for which the revenue is recurring  or ratable in nature  with the balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product revenue is recognized up front 
during fiscal  approximately of the total value of our executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders 
if we achieve this desired mix of executed orders over time and there are no significant changes to our business  eventually approximately of our revenue would come from ratable orders 
customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type  timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity 
for example  if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use  this will result in either a subscription or term license 
a business implication of this decision is that  at the expiration of the license period  the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement 
historically  larger customers generally used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license 
see the discussion under the heading critical accounting estimates revenue recognition and note of our consolidated financial statements for additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue recognition 
although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period  we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on  among other things  the competitiveness of our new technology  timing of contract renewals with existing customers  length of our sales cycle  and size  duration  terms and type of contract renewals with existing customers  additional sales to existing customers  and sales to new customers 
the value and duration of contracts  and consequently product revenue recognized  is affected by the competitiveness of our products 
product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription  term or perpetual licenses  and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms 
the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers eg  customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements 
revenue mix we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group  combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our product groups were as follows functional verification products in this group  including the incisive functional verification platform  are used to verify that the high level  logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct 
digital ic design products in this group  including the encounter digital ic design platform  are used to accurately convert the high level  logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented 
this data is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 
custom ic design our custom design products  including the virtuoso custom design platform  are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level  including analog  rf  memory  high performance digital blocks and 
table of contents standard cell libraries 
detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 
system interconnect design this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products  including the allegro and orcad products 
the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co design of interconnects across ics  ic packages and pcbs  while the orcad line focuses on cost effective  entry level pcb solutions 
design for manufacturing included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products 
these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 
our strategy includes focusing on integrating dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter digital ic design and virtuoso custom design

revenue by year the following table shows our revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and the dollar change in revenue between years change vs 
vs 
in millions product services maintenance total revenue product revenue decreased during each of fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment  the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers  our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle 
as a result  product revenue decreased for all product groups  and particularly for digital ic design  custom ic design and functional verification products during both fiscal and fiscal we expect to recognize increased revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to higher business levels and our continued transition to our more ratable business model 
services revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers  primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations 
maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the following lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment  an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers  primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations  and a decline in maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the average duration of software license arrangements  because the annual fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with shorter durations 

table of contents the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal functional verification digital ic design custom ic design system interconnect design design for manufacturing services and other total as described under the heading critical accounting estimates  certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products 
additionally  we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date 
for these arrangements  we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers 
the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and  if that proves to be the case  the revenue allocation in the above table would differ 
although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable  there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement

stock based compensation expense during fiscal also decreased  as compared to fiscal  due to the reversal of million of stock based compensation expense related to the modification of certain performance based restricted stock awards  partially offset by an increase in stock option expense due to the acceleration of vesting of certain executives that resigned during fiscal we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to decrease during fiscal  primarily due to lower fair values at grant dates for restricted stock and stock options  the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options as a result of our restructuring plans and other attrition  and a reduced number of equity grants during fiscal effects of restructuring plans we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels 
to offset some of the impact of the decrease in our revenue  we have implemented cost savings initiatives  including reducing headcount and related costs and reducing other discretionary spending 
during fiscal  we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue 
this restructuring plan decreased costs during fiscal by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately positions 
we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately million related to the restructuring activities and other expense reductions initiated in fiscal during fiscal  we initiated an additional restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue

the change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with subscription licenses 
also  as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during and and the financial challenges experienced by banks  a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about over exposure to the technology sector 
bad debt expense increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  because certain of our customers experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business  which has resulted and may continue to result in a delay or default on their payment obligations

see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of these restructuring plans 
because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans  based on then currently available information  our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated 
demand for our products and services and  ultimately  our future financial performance  is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult to predict in light of the current economic challenges and uncertainty 
accordingly  additional actions  including further restructuring of our operations  may be required in the future 
restructuring plan we have recorded total costs associated with the restructuring plan of million 
the costs recorded as part of the restructuring plan include severance payments  severance related benefits and costs for outplacement services that were communicated to the affected employees before january   and estimated severance payments and related benefits that were both probable and estimable as of january  for employees notified after january  total severance and termination benefits of approximately million related to the restructuring plan were paid to employees before january  approximately million of severance and termination benefits related to the restructuring plan will be paid after january   all of which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  due to varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate  we expect substantially all termination benefits to be paid by january  we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately million related to the restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan related annual operating expense savings related to the restructuring activities which we initiated during the fourth quarter of and announced in january will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies

during fiscal  we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the restructuring plan  whereby we paid million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility 
we recorded a credit to restructuring and other charges of million during fiscal  representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid 
impairment of goodwill we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount 
we completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded an impairment of goodwill of  million  representing all of our goodwill 
for additional description of our impairment of goodwill  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible and tangible assets in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made certain changes to our dfm product strategy 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets 
we also abandoned and impaired million of other long lived assets during fiscal interest expense as adjusted as adjusted in millions interest expense 
table of contents on the first day of fiscal  we adopted new accounting principles as required by the debt with conversion and other options subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification  which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this retroactive adoption required us to adjust our consolidated financial statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years 
the primary components of interest expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal consisted of the non cash component associated with the amortization of the debt discount as required under these new accounting principles and the contractual interest expense of our convertible senior notes 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was as follows in millions interest income gains on sale of non marketable securities gains losses on available for sale securities gains losses on securities in the non qualified deferred compensation trust gains losses on foreign exchange net loss on liquidation of subsidiary equity loss from investments write down of investments other income total other income expense  net the decrease in interest income during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates

all of these impairments are included in the write down of investments line in the above table 
during fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares of mentor graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics 
after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics during fiscal  we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics at a loss of million  which is included in the gains losses on available for sale securities line in the above table 
the million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses  net of gains  previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 
table of contents provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows as adjusted as adjusted in millions  except percentages provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate during fiscal  a change in united states federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal net operating loss for a period of three  four or five years instead of the general two year carryback period 
our benefit for income taxes during fiscal is primarily due to million of tax benefit from the fiscal united states federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years  that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of million  and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits  penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of million 
with the exception of the fiscal united states federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years  we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal united states losses and tax credits 
the million increase in unrecognized tax benefits  penalties and interest during fiscal included million of unrecognized tax benefits  penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal through fiscal the effects on our fiscal results and our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are not considered material 
we had a fiscal provision for income taxes  primarily due to the significant fiscal tax expenses related to the impairment of non deductible goodwill  the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings 
during fiscal  we recognized the impairment of  million of united states goodwill that was non deductible 
we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization 
in making this judgment  we considered the fiscal loss that resulted in a cumulative three year loss and other factors 
finally  given the challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal  we decided that million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
as a result  we accrued a tax expense of million during fiscal to provide for the federal  state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations 
our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal  as compared to the positive effective tax rate for fiscal  primarily due to the fiscal loss before provision for income taxes and the fiscal tax expenses related to the impairment of non deductible goodwill  the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflects the million tax benefit from the fiscal effective settlement of the irs exam for the tax years 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be negative 
our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal the effective tax rate is negative because we expect to record a loss before provision for income taxes during fiscal and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards generated during fiscal we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of january   to meet the working capital and long term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries 
the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately million as of january  we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we concluded that a valuation 
table of contents allowance of million was required as of january  this represents an increase in valuation allowance of million in comparison with the year ended january  if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received rars indicating that the irs has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels  the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables 
as a result of the challenging economic environment  our customers  who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector  have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result  may delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations 
approximately half of our total receivables  net and installment contract receivables  net as of january  relate to ten of our customers 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  although these obligations are generally not cancelable 
our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments

included in other long term contractual obligations are long term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million  and of that amount we estimate that million will be paid or settled within to years 
we did not include the remaining long term income tax liabilities of million in the table above  because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability 
however  the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations that cannot be estimated with certainty

new accounting standards in october  the fasb issued new accounting standards for multiple deliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
the new standards for multiple deliverable arrangements enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are excluded from the pre existing software revenue guidance 
in addition  hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the pre existing software revenue guidance 
we are currently evaluating the application to our revenue arrangements of the two new accounting standards described above 
the impact of these new standards may result in revenue being recognized for certain sales of hardware and nonsoftware related deliverables separate from the software deliverables within a multiple element arrangement 
both of these new standards are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified during fiscal years beginning on or after june   with the option to provide retrospective presentation for prior years  with early adoption permitted 
we plan to adopt these two new accounting standards during our first quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb issued new accounting standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity 
these new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
the provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
these standards will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that these new standards will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk most of our revenue  expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar 
however  certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and  therefore  we benefit from a weaker dollar  and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency  we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase 
table of contents in expenses 
conversely  the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
conversely  a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and  therefore  the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income  net  in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 
our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes 
our forward contracts generally have maturities of days or less 
the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures 
recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 
the following table provides information  as of january   about our forward foreign currency contracts 
the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts 
the table presents the notional amounts  at contract exchange rates  and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar  which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency 
all of these forward contracts matured during january weighted average notional contract principal rate in millions forward contracts japanese yen european union euro indian rupee canadian dollar israeli shekel new taiwan dollar hong kong dollar british pound sterling total n a estimated fair value while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks  there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents 
while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates 
in this regard  changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

table of contents we invest in high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
as part of our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk  and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the short term interest bearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available for sale and are considered to be short term investments

concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions  sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock

investments we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non marketable equity securities
