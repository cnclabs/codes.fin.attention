item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we require additional financing to sustain our operations  and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during the year ended december   we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  and had net cash used in operations of  as of december   we had an excess of current liabilities compared to current assets of million 
our current financing source is our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na as successor by merger to lasalle bank national association 
as of march   the outstanding loan balance was  with available borrowings of  the credit facility matures on june  as of december   we also had a million line of credit held by rockport investments  ltd  which it purchased on february  from bruno guazzoni  the uncle of our chief executive officer and the owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  in addition to the line of credit  as of the end of fiscal  we also had outstanding promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of million originally issued to bruno guazzoni  which were sold by him to rockport investments  ltd 
on february  on march   we exchanged the debt held by rockport investments  ltd 
for a new note convertible into shares of our common stock at any time after stockholder approval of the transaction at the option of the noteholder provided  however  that without stockholder approval of the transaction  the note may not be converted into more than of the common stock outstanding before the issuance of the convertible note 
the note has a principal amount of  bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears  and matures on march  the conversion rate is initially equal to the closing bid price immediately preceding the closing date 
rockport may  at its option  reset the conversion price once per calendar year to the greater of a the average of the closing sales price of the company s common stock during the preceding consecutive trading day period and b 
the conversion price is also subject to adjustment in the event of dilutive issuances by the company or the company s issuance of options  warrants of other rights to purchase the company s common stock or convertible securities subject to certain exceptions  including the grant of options to purchase common stock to employees  officers  directors or consultants of the company 
in addition  rockport has the right to vote on all matters to which holders of our common stock are entitled to vote  on an as converted basis using the closing bid price immediately preceding the closing date as the conversion rate  although this voting right does not become effective until our stockholders approve the terms of the convertible note that provide for the potential issuance of more than of our common stock on a pre transaction basis upon conversion of the convertible note by rockport and grant this voting power to the noteholder 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible note  effective upon such stockholder approval  rockport would have the right to vote approximately of our common stock  however  rockport has entered into a voting agreement with our chief executive officer  claudio guazzoni  pursuant to which it has appointed mr 
guazzoni as its proxy to vote on rockport s behalf in all matters to which stockholders are entitled to vote beginning upon such stockholder approval and continuing for the life of the note 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the loss from continuing operations  working capital deficit and current maturity dates of our outstanding debt and available borrowings raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the company is currently negotiating the refinancing or replacement of its credit facility or is otherwise looking to secure additional funding  though there can be no assurances that such financing will be obtained on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to refinance or replace this debt  we may not be able to continue our operations 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets or the amount of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
current economic conditions and reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers 
the purchase of our services may be discretionary and may require our customers to make significant commitments of capital 
during the current economic downturn  business spending on information technology has decreased 
continued weak economic conditions  or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve  could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flow  particularly through reduced contracts for service and lower prices for our services  difficulty in the collection of our accounts receivable and lower recoverability of assets 
we may experience difficulties in scaling our operations to react to economic pressures in the us in order to continue to increase sales and marketing efforts  to expand and enhance the solutions and services we are able to offer to current and future customers and to fund potential acquisitions  we will require additional capital that may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as a consequence  we will be required to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative relationships  bank facilities or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  all of which have contracted sharply in the last two years 
any additional equity financing is expected to be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increased interest costs 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through private sales of equity securities  and loans from related parties and business associates 
in addition  if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of these capital raising or other aspects of our business  we may be required to spend funds in an amount greater than anticipated 
such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our inability to obtain sufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our expansion programs or to limit the marketing of our services 
any such disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future discretionary uses of cash 
we also continue to explore other ways to maximize the value of the company for its stockholders 
the company has not achieved profitability in each reporting period and may incur net losses in future quarters 
the company has a history of operating losses  including a loss from continuing operations of approximately  for the year ended december  and a loss from continuing operations of approximately  for the year ended december  we may incur additional operating losses in the future 
operating expenses may increase as we seek to grow our business through acquisition and as our existing business expands 
even if we achieve consistent profitability  we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or be able to raise capital in sufficient amounts to enable us to continue to expand our business 
an inability to sustain profitability may also result in an impairment loss in the value of our long lived assets  principally goodwill  property and equipment  and other tangible and intangible assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise capital in sufficient amounts  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
termination of a contract by a significant customer and or cancellation with short notice  or failure by us to attract new customers and replace customers not renewing their contracts  could reduce our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
for the year ended december   our largest customer  reynolds consumer products company  accounted for approximately of revenues 
non renewal or termination of contracts with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a large portion of our revenues were derived from professional services that are generally non recurring in nature 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional contracts for projects similar in scope to those previously obtained from our principal customers or any other customer  that we will be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers or that we will not remain largely dependent on a limited customer base  which may continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
in addition  we may be subject to delays in customer funding  non renewal  delay  termination  reduction or modification of contracts in the event of changes in customer policies or as a result of budgetary constraints  and increased or unexpected costs resulting in losses under fixed fee contracts 
our success in meeting growth targets is dependent on our ability to maintain existing clients and to continually attract and retain new customers to replace customers who have not renewed their contracts 
achieving significant market acceptance requires substantial effort and expenditures on our part to create awareness of our services 
an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  could materially and adversely affect our business 
revenues are difficult to forecast 
we may increase our corporate overhead expenses as we integrate past and future acquisitions and we build an infrastructure to implement our strategy 
meanwhile  our business units may increase their operating expenses for sales  marketing and technical personnel to sell  provide and support their products and services 
additionally  at any given point in time  and especially in the current challenging economic climate  we may have significant accounts receivable balances with customers that expose us to credit risks 
if we have an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
it services are subject to uncertain demand due to emerging and evolving markets and technology 
the markets for some of our services are changing rapidly and evolving and  therefore  the ultimate level of demand for our services is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
any significant decline in demand for programming and applications development and it consulting services could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
significant technological changes could render our existing products and services obsolete 
to be successful  we must adapt to this rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services to meet customers needs 
if we are unable to respond to technological advances and conform to emerging industry standards in a cost effective and timely manner  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition for our it solutions is significant  and we expect that competition will continue to intensify due to the low barriers to entry 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  sales and marketing or support capabilities to successfully meet this competition 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors  our business will be adversely affected 
we compete against numerous large companies that have substantially greater market presence  longer operating histories  more significant customer bases  and financial  technical  facilities  marketing  capital and other resources than we have 
our competitors include national  regional and local it consulting service providers  software development firms and major accounting and consulting firms such as accenture  cap gemini  ernst young  ibm global services  keane  kforce and mps group 
in addition  we also encounter competition from numerous other businesses that provide one or more similar goods or services  including numerous resellers of internet related hardware and software and web site development companies 
our competitors may respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
they may develop products and services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than ours 
competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further impact our ability to effectively compete 
new competitors  including large computer hardware  software  professional services and other technology and telecommunications companies  may enter our markets and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result of increased competition and vertical and horizontal integration in the industry  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products and services 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher revenue from consulting services  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  professional services businesses are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in decreased pricing and other competition 
moreover  there is a high degree of competition among companies seeking to acquire interests in it service companies such as those we have historically targeted for acquisition 
we are and will continue to be a minor participant in the business of seeking business relationships with  and acquisitions of interests in such companies 
a large number of established and  in some cases  well financed entities  including venture capital firms  are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find desirable acquisition candidates 
many of these investment oriented entities have significantly greater financial resources  technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do 
consequently  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible investments in these entities 
entrepreneur founders of privately held it service companies  including those suffering as a result of the volatile economic climate of recent years and those facing potential bankruptcy restructuring or liquidation  generally place greater emphasis on gaining access to capital than obtaining the management skills and networking services that we can provide 
even if we are able to successfully compete with these other entities  this competition may affect the terms and conditions of potential acquisitions and  as a result  we may pay more than expected for targeted companies 
if we cannot acquire interests in attractive companies on reasonable terms  our growth by acquisition strategy may not succeed 
operations interruptions caused by systems failures could adversely affect our business 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
we currently maintain most of our computer systems in our facilities in new york  ny and at business unit offices in needham  ma  stoneham  ma  west chester  oh  indianapolis  in  jacksonville  fl  alpharetta  ga  makati city  philippines and north palm beach  fl 
interruptions could result from natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
we also lease telecommunications lines from local and regional carriers  whose service may be interrupted 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays network operations could materially and adversely affect our business 
security breaches could expose our company to a risk of loss or liability 
our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person or entity circumvents our security measures  they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate their operations with our own 
a key element of our expansion strategy is to grow through acquisitions 
if we identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make investments or acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms 
acquisitions may cause a disruption of our ongoing business  distract management  require other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures 
we may not be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies or maintain good relations with their customers or suppliers 
we may be required to incur additional debt  if available  and we may be required to issue equity securities  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  to fund acquisitions 
unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that any completed acquisition will enhance our business 
since the normal consideration in our acquisitions comprises both cash and shares of our common stock  if we proceed with one or more significant acquisitions  the potential impacts are a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the acquisitions and or we could incur or assume significant amounts of additional indebtedness  and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interest in our common stock 
also  acquisitions are required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which results in us recording significant amounts of goodwill 
the inability of a subsidiary to sustain profitability may result in an impairment loss in the value associated with that subsidiary  principally goodwill 
in accordance with accounting standards  purchased goodwill should not be amortized  but rather  should be periodically reviewed for impairment 
such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control 
furthermore  at the time goodwill is considered impaired  an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the timing of such an impairment if any of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict 
our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to determine whether goodwill acquired in past acquisitions has been impaired in accordance with accounting standards  and  if so  charge such impairment as an expense 
we have goodwill of approximately million at december   so if we are required to take such additional impairment charges  or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future  our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we review for impairment annually on october  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and customer demand  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future 
significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates  estimating the applicable tax rates and interest rates  projecting the future industry trends and market conditions  and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  including changes in our reporting structure  could materially affect our determinations of fair value 
our success depends on our retaining key personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the sectors in which we operate 
the loss of existing personnel or the failure to recruit additional qualified managerial  technical  and sales personnel  as well as expenses in connection with hiring and retaining personnel  could adversely affect our business 
we also depend on the performance of our executive officers and key employees  most of whom have not entered into employment agreements 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we will need to attract  train and retain more employees for management  engineering  programming  sales and marketing  and customer service and support positions 
competition for qualified employees  particularly engineers  programmers and consultants continues to be high 
because of the competition in our industry and other reasons  we may not be successful in attracting  training and retaining the people we need to continue to offer solutions and services to present and future customers in a cost effective manner or at all 
fluctuation in quarterly operating results may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are within our control 
quarter to quarter comparisons of the results of operations as an indication of future performance should not be relied upon 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock may fall 
factors that could cause quarterly results to fluctuate include change in customer demand for  or the inability of our customers to pay for  our products and services  timing of the expansion of operations  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or services by competitors or zanett  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  continued volatility in the us economy or a slow economy recovery  or termination or non renewal of customer contracts 
changes in government regulations may adversely impact our business 
there are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws and regulations relate to liability for information received from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
the government may also seek to regulate some segments of our activities as basic telecommunications services 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
we may be faced with potential claims for liability if we cannot adequately meet our customers expectations 
our services involve development  implementation and maintenance of computer systems and computer software that are critical to the operations of our customers businesses 
our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services could harm our business reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for such failure or inability 
in addition  in the course of performing services  our personnel often gain access to technologies and content that includes confidential or proprietary customer information 
any such unauthorized disclosure or use could result in a claim for substantial damages 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are uninsured  exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes to our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co insurance requirements  could adversely affect us 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
the law relating to the liability of online service providers  private network operators and internet service providers for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
for example  lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material inappropriate for viewing by young children can be accessed from the web sites we may host 
claims could also involve matters such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
providers of internet products and services have been sued in the past  sometimes successfully  based on the content of material 
if we have to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks  or are required to defend ourselves against such claims  our business may be materially adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of future sales by existing stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales may occur 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it reflects fair value 
as of december   we had granted options to purchase  shares under our stock option plan 
the total number of options authorized under the stock option plan  as amended  is  if the holders of these options and any other options we have issued were to exercise their rights and sell the shares issued to them  it could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile  and if we do not remain compliant with nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
on september   the company received a notice from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq notifying us we were out of compliance with nasdaq listing rule a because the bid price of our common stock had closed at less than per share over the previous consecutive business days 
nasdaq gave us calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the rule 
on march   we received a second notification from nasdaq that we had not regained compliance with the minimum closing bid price rule 
because we had met all initial listing criteria for the nasdaq capital market other than the minimum closing bid price rule on march   nasdaq gave us an additional days to regain compliance with the rule 
on march  we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that we had regained compliance with the minimum closing bid price rule  however there is no assurance we will continue to be in compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid price rule or the other listing requirements in the future 
if we do not remain compliant with the nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
we have not historically paid  and do not anticipate in the foreseeable future paying cash dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business and or to fund future acquisitions 
our credit facility with bank of america prohibits us from declaring or paying any dividends  except for dividends or other distributions made by zcs to us  provided  however  that we may accrue but not pay dividends as payment in kind 
we expect any replacement financing to contain similar restrictions 
the concentrated ownership of our company may discourage potential transactions involving zanett 
claudio guazzoni  our chief executive officer owned approximately of the outstanding common stock as of march   and in addition  mr 
guazzoni s uncle  bruno guazzoni  owned  as of march   approximately of the outstanding common stock 
moreover  as a result of the voting agreement entered into between claudio guazzoni and rockport investments  ltd 
on march   mr 
guazzoni will have the right to vote an additional approximately of the outstanding common stock  effective upon stockholder approval of the issuance of the convertible note and related transactions although as a result of such transaction claudio guazzoni s ownership interest is approximately and bruno guazzoni s ownership interest is approximately 
as a result  the guazzoni family possesses significant influence over zanett s decision making on business matters  including the election of directors 
the concentration of zanett share ownership may delay or prevent a change in the control of zanett  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover  or other transaction involving our company  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of zanett 
our rapid growth has strained  and may continue to strain  managerial and operational resources 
our rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on managerial and operational resources 
further  as we grow  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
further growth or an increase in the number of strategic relationships may increase this strain on existing managerial and operational resources  inhibiting our ability to successfully implement our strategy without incurring additional corporate expenses 
our future growth is dependent on producing revenue sufficient to cover increasing expenses 
expenses will increase as we continue to build our infrastructure to implement our strategy 
we expect to hire additional employees and expand information technology systems 
we also may increase our operating expenses to broaden our support capabilities for our clients  explore acquisition opportunities and alliances with other companies  and facilitate business arrangements among our business units 
if the higher expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our earnings will be lower than anticipated or we may incur losses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section also contains forward looking statements and is subject to the disclosure regarding forward looking statements in part i of this report 
versus results of operations revenues decreased for the year ended december  to  from  during the year ended december  this decrease in revenue can be attributed primarily to a reduction in demand for our services due to the weakened economy and decreasing demand in the it industry as a whole 
particularly in the first quarter of  we saw a significant decline in our pipeline of potential contracts with customers 
this decrease resulted in fewer closed customer deals in we saw this pipeline increase late in and continue strong in the first three months of costs of revenues decreased to  during the year ended december   versus  for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributed to our decline in revenue and  accordingly  a corresponding decrease in the billable hours for which we utilized our work force 
as a result  gross margins in fiscal decreased to of revenues from in fiscal as a result of an increase in our business in late and early  work force utilization has rebounded in the first three months of to first quarter levels 
we decreased our selling and marketing expense by to  for the year ended december   as compared with  during the year ended december  this decrease in costs is related to a further reduction in commission and other various marketing expenses in the third quarter of  as part of our overall cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   were  as compared with  during  remaining relatively flat 
consolidated net loss income on a consolidated basis  the decrease in operating expenses partly offset the effect of the decrease in revenue resulting in an operating loss of  for the year ended december   as compared to operating income of  for the year ended december  net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in the decrease was a result of the decrease of the prime rate in versus our loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  for the year ended december   as compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   compared to an income tax provision of  for we recorded a  and  gain on the sale of pdi net of taxes  in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
loss from the discontinued operations of pdi  net of tax  was  for the year ended december  the company s tax basis exceeds the gain and therefore there is no tax effect 
pdi was classified as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of and sold in the first quarter of as a result of all of the above  for the year ended december   we reported a consolidated net loss of  as compared to consolidated net income of  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and significant use of estimates in the company s financial statements in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction in conformity with gaap is specifically dictated  with little or no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  the preparation of gaap financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion reviews the critical accounting policies and items incorporated in the company s consolidated financial statements that required the use of significant management estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of zanett s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified revenue recognition  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles as critical accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition the company earns revenue primarily from it professional services 
revenues from contracts for consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition 
we consider revenue to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
revenues from fixed fee contracts for professional services are recognized using contract accounting based on the estimated percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each contract is determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to a current estimate of total project costs since management believes this reflects the extent of contract completion 
changes in estimated costs during the course of a fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which such facts become known 
if such changes indicate that a loss may be realized on a contract  the entire loss is recorded at such time 
on occasion  certain contracts may have substantive customer acceptance provisions 
in such cases  revenue is recognized upon receipt of acceptance from the customer 
out of pocket expenses incurred during the performance of professional service contracts are included in costs of revenues and any amounts re invoiced to customers are included in revenue during the period in which they are incurred 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for which services have been performed and costs incurred that have not yet been invoiced to the customer 
stock based compensation the company has entered into several transactions involving the issuance of shares of restricted common stock to independent contractors and certain key employees 
the company has also issued stock options to employees and non employees 
the issuance of these securities required management to estimate their value using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain estimates for values of variables used by the model 
management estimated the values for stock price volatility  the expected life of the equity instruments and the risk free rate based on information that was available to management at the time the black scholes option pricing calculations were performed 
purchase accounting in connection with its acquisitions  the company allocates the total acquisition costs to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and all liabilities assumed  with the excess purchase price recorded to goodwill 
to arrive at the allocation of the total purchase price  management makes certain assumptions in estimating the fair market value of the acquired companies tangible assets  intangible assets such as customer lists  and long term contracts and liabilities 
goodwill the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses is considered to be goodwill 
under authoritative guidance  purchased goodwill is not amortized  but rather  periodically but at least annually reviewed for impairment 
we have remaining goodwill of  and  at december  and  respectively 
this goodwill resulted from the acquisition of all of the stock or substantially all of the assets  as applicable  of back bay technologies  inc  inrange global consulting  whitbread technology partners  inc  data road  inc  dba group  llc 
and ps golive  llc 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have determined that we have only one reporting unit  zcs 
in october and  we performed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and concluded that no impairment charge was required for either year 
under authoritative guidance we are required to follow the two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determined the fair value of our reporting unit based on an combined income approach using a discounted cash flow methodology  and market approach based upon comparable values of companies similar to zcs and the market capitalization of the company 
this approach requires us to use significant judgment including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  determination of our weighted average cost of capital for purposes of establishing a discount rate  and relevant market data 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of impairment testing in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
based on our valuation results  we determined that the fair value of our reporting unit at october  ranged from of its carrying value based solely on a discounted cash flow method  to based upon a blended discounted cash flow  comparable market value and market capitalization approach  which are discussed in detail below 
therefore  management determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as of october  market capitalization is a relevant and objective  but not conclusive  indicator of the company s fair value considered in our evaluation of goodwill impairment 
during its fiscal year  the company s closing stock price fluctuated from a low of 
to a high of 
as directed by authoritative guidance  we evaluated the trading activity in the company s common stock  including bid ask spreads and the significant decline in trading volumes 
based on this evaluation  we concluded that it would not be appropriate to place significant reliance on the stock prices we observed as being representative of the our reporting unit s fair value 
in particular  we noted that the volume had significantly decreased and transactions may not be orderly as well as the fact that the company s market capitalization includes corporate costs and debt not related to the zcs reporting unit 
accordingly  at the measurement date we placed greater reliance on the projected discounted cash flow method 
during the fall of  our market capitalization declined significantly  along with that of other public companies in and outside of our industry as a result of declining worldwide economic conditions caused by the tightening of global credit markets 
the company s stock has traded below net book value per share over the past year 
we do not believe the recent general downturn in the us and global equity markets is representative of any fundamental change in our business 
the global recession has generally impacted both the timing and size of our customer orders 
our discounted cash flow projections were based on a five year financial forecast 
the five year forecast was based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business 
the significant assumptions of these five year forecasts which were used in determining fair value of our single reporting unit included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  which are in line with our recent historical growth rates  gross margins of which are similar to our recent historic gross margins  and future cash flows were discounted to present value using an end of year convention and weighted average cost of capital of 
we believe these estimated assumptions are appropriate for our circumstances  in line with or below our historical results and consistent with our forecasted long term business model 
these assumptions also have considered the current economic environment 
however  due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future 
changes in these estimates or assumptions  including changes in our reporting structure  could materially affect our determination of fair value 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing as of ocotber  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our estimates and assumptions are not materially accurate  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing october  or prior to that  if any such changes constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if that does  whether such charge would be material 
reference should also be made to item a risk factors unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business intangibles and long lived assets intangibles and long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  which is provided for by charges to income on a basis consistent with the utilization of the assets over their useful lives 
the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets is reviewed periodically by the company for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
if such circumstances exist  the company estimates the future  undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset  and compare that to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the cost of intangibles is based on the estimated fair values calculated as of the date of acquisition of the related company 
such estimates are based on highly subjective estimates made by management 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
we determined that there was no impairment as of december  and liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing a decrease of  from the december  year end balance of  this decrease was attributable to the decline in our revenues in the last nine months of cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to decline in our operating results and a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of our revenue decline  partially offset by a increase in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the change primarily reflects net proceeds of  received in for the pdi sale compared to  in in addition  we incurred expenses related to additions to property and equipment of  and  in  and  respectively 
in we had cash paid for acquisitions of  but we did not have any cash outflows for acquisitions in in and we had  and  of contingent consideration paid 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  versus cash used in financing activities of  in this activity in included approximately  of loan repayments from the proceeds of the pdi transaction 
on december  we entered into a revolving credit facility with lasalle bank national associations  which facility is now with bank of america  na  as successor by merger to lasalle 
the credit agreement was amended on may   november   march   january  and december  as amended  the available line of credit is based on of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum of million 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus and c the day libor rate plus  in each case plus per annum 
the credit facility terms require the company to meet certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of to  a maximum senior debt ratio of to  maintenance of minimum net availability of  at all times  and excess cash flow of not less than at all times  tested quarterly 
the company was not in compliance with these covenants as of december  as of march   the outstanding loan balance was  with available borrowings of  as the credit facility matures on june   we are currently in discussions with various senior lenders to replace or refinance this facility 
as of december   our other source of liquidity was a  line of credit agreement with bruno guazzoni  the uncle of our chief executive officer and owner of of our outstanding common stock as of march  advances under this line of credit bear interest at prime plus 
as of december   our balance on the line of credit was  with available borrowings of  as of the end of fiscal  we also had two promissory notes originally issued to bruno guazzoni in the aggregate principal amount of  these notes bear interest at  payable quarterly 
the line of credit and both promissory notes matured on march  however  mr 
guazzoni sold the line of credit and promissory notes to rockport investments  ltd 
in a private transaction on february  on march  we exchanged the debt held by rockport investments  ltd 
for a new note convertible into shares of our common stock at any time following stockholder approval of the transaction at the option of the noteholder provided  however  that without stockholder approval of the transaction  the note may not be converted into more than of the common stock outstanding before the issuance of the convertible note 
the note has a principal amount of  and bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears 
the conversion rate is initially equal to the closing bid price immediately preceding the closing date 
rockport may  at its option  reset the conversion price once per calendar year to the greater of a the average of the closing price of the company s common stock during the preceding consecutive trading day period and b 
the conversion price is also subject to adjustment in the event of dilutive issuances by the company or the company s issuance of options  warrants or other rights to purchase the company s common stock or convertible securities subject to certain exceptions  including the grant of options to purchase common stock to employees  officers  directors or consultants of the company 
in addition  the noteholder has the right to vote on all matters to which holders of our common stock are entitled to vote  on an as converted basis using the closing bid price immediately preceding the closing date as the conversion rate  although this voting right does not become effective until our stockholders approve the terms of the convertible note that provide for the potential issuance of more than of the company s common stock on a pre transaction basis upon conversion of the convertible note by rockport and grant this voting power to the noteholder 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible note  effective upon such stockholder approval  rockport would have the right to vote approximately of the company s common stock  however  rockport has entered into a voting agreement with our chief executive officer  claudio guazzoni  pursuant to which it has appointed mr 
guazzoni as its proxy to vote on rockport s behalf in all matters to which stockholders are entitled to vote beginning upon such stockholder approval and continuing for the life of the note 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of this exchange transaction and the new convertible note 
because of our net loss from continuing operations of  in  our working capital deficit  the current maturity dates of our revolving credit facility  and our limited access to additional borrowings under these financing arrangements  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets or the amount of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
management will continue to monitor the company s cash position carefully and evaluate its future operating cash requirements with respect to its strategy  business objectives and performance 
however  due to the scheduled debt maturities discussed above the company requires additional capital or other sources of financing in order to meet its commitments 
if necessary we will explore other sources of capital  to fund future acquisitions and provide additional working capital 
we also continue to explore other opportunities that may be available to maximize the company s value for its stockholders  including strategic transactions 
as a result of tightening of the credit markets and volatility in the equity markets  it may be difficult for us to secure such additional liquidity sources on favorable terms or at all 
if we cannot secure additional funding  we will be unable to finance our acquisition strategy and or continue our organic growth  and we may need to reduce the scope of our existing operations and or curtail some of our present operations 
to further minimize cash outlays  we expect to continue to supplement compensation for both existing and new employees with equity incentives where possible 
we believe that this strategy provides the ability to increase stockholder value  as well as utilize cash resources more effectively 
to support this strategy  the stockholders of the company  at its annual meeting in june  approved an amendment to the zanett  inc incentive stock plan stock plan that increased the number of equity securities that can be issued under the plan from  shares to  shares 
while this increase allows us greater flexibility in its use of stock based compensation  the issuance of equity securities under the stock plan may result in dilution to existing stockholders 
the company s board of directors reauthorized a stock repurchase plan effective march  that allows us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock from time to time in open market transactions 
under the stock repurchase plan  as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of  none of these shares were repurchased in or these shares are reflected as treasury stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company enters into many contractual and commercial undertakings during the normal course of business 
also  all of our acquisitions were structured with additional contingent purchase price obligations that may be payable if the subsidiaries achieve certain annual performance requirements 
the company s liquidity could also be impacted by its concentration of credit risk associated with its bank accounts and accounts receivable  as follows we maintain our cash balances and money market instruments with three separate institutions which we believe are of high credit quality to minimize our exposure 
however  these deposits are subject to federal deposit insurance limits 
we believe that any credit risk associated with our receivables is minimal due to the size and credit worthiness of our customers  which are principally large domestic corporations 
however  the uncertainty of the current economic climate affects our level of assurance regarding any of our customers financial well being 
during  no one customer accounted for more than of revenues  although our largest customer  reynolds consumer products company  accounted for approximately of revenues 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of revenues 
at december  and december   the company did not have a customer account that accounted for over of accounts receivable 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the fasb accounting standards asc topic and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
made the fasb accounting standards codification the asc the single source of us generally accepted accounting policies us gaap used by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws which are sources of authoritative accounting guidance for sec registrants 
the asc is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
the asc supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for the company beginning july  following sfas no 
 the board will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the asc topic  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the asc 
in the description of asc and accounting standards updates asu that follows  references in italics relate to asc or asu topics and their descriptive titles  as appropriate 
in september  the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu  which excludes tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of subtopic  revenue recognition 
asu is effective for periods beginning after december  with earlier adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption of asu and the impact that asu will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu which supersede certain guidance in asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this topic requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
this topic is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact that this topic will have on its consolidated financial statements
