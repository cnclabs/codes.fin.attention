table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank the community bank and new york commercial bank the commercial bank collectively  the banks 
executive summary as more fully discussed in the following pages  was a year of challenges as the economy continued to falter and achievements as we expanded our franchise  increased our earnings  and enhanced our capital strength 
challenges the economic crisis that began in the second half of continued to adversely impact our nation  as unemployment rose  real estate values declined  and bankruptcies increased in for the first time in years  unemployment grew to in october  before retracting to the following month 
in december  home prices were down year over year throughout the nation  and the number of businesses filing for bankruptcy rose to  as the recession continued to impact small and large businesses alike 
in the metro new york region  where most of the properties securing our loans are located  the statistics tell a similar tale of economic decline 
in december  unemployment rose to in new york city  on long island  and in new jersey  and home prices declined  year over year  throughout metro new york 
in addition  of manhattan s office space was vacant in december  as compared to in december not surprisingly  these increases had an effect on the quality of our assets  despite the strength of our underwriting standards and the unique character of our primary lending niche 
as non performing assets rose  together with our net charge offs  we increased our provision for loan losses from million in to million  and our loan loss allowance from million to million at year end the recession also took a toll on certain of our investment securities  as the other than temporary impairment otti losses we recorded reduced our earnings by million  or per diluted share 
our earnings growth was also subdued by the higher cost of fdic deposit insurance  as the premiums paid by healthy banks were increased by the fdic 
as more and more borrowers fell victim to the prolonged recession  the number of bank failures rose from in to in to further replenish the deposit insurance fund  the fdic imposed a special assessment in the second quarter 
as a result of these actions  our total fdic related expenses rose to million in from million in the year earlier twelve months 
while these challenges were counterproductive to earnings  their impact was more than exceeded by the achievements noted below 
achievements in  our consistent pursuit of the strategies that comprise our business model resulted in our best financial performance since while asset quality declined due to the aforementioned economic factors  we expanded our net interest margin  increased our net interest income  and grew our earnings and capital meaningfully over the course of the year 
growth through acquisitions capitalizing on the opportunity to grow through fdic assisted transactions  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of amtrust bank amtrust on december  in addition to expanding our community bank franchise with the addition of branches in florida  ohio  and arizona  the amtrust acquisition increased our interest earning assets with loans of billion and securities of million  and enhanced our liquidity with an infusion of billion in cash and cash equivalents 
furthermore  the acquisition enhanced our funding mix by providing deposits of billion  in addition to billion of wholesale borrowings 

table of contents the loans we acquired are covered by certain loss sharing agreements which reduce the risk of having acquired loans outside our traditional market and lending niche 
of the billion in loans we acquired  billion were one to four family credits  the remainder consisted primarily of home equity lines of credit helocs and consumer loans 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic will reimburse the community bank for of losses up to million and of losses beyond that initial amount with respect to these covered loans 
another positive feature of the transaction was the potential for revenue enhancement  primarily through the addition of amtrust s mortgage banking unit  which originates loans for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
although our earnings reflect less than a month of combined operations with amtrust  we recorded a one time bargain purchase gain in connection with the transaction that added million to our earnings and to our diluted earnings per share 
other immediate contributions to earnings from the amtrust acquisition are discussed under non interest income beginning on page of this report 
multi family lending multi family loans continued to be our principal asset  notwithstanding the amtrust related growth of our one to four family mortgage loan portfolio 
although loan production was somewhat constrained by the general reluctance of property owners to refinance their loans or increase their real estate holdings  in view of current market conditions  we originated billion of multi family loans in  and grew the multi family loan portfolio by billion  or  to billion at december st 
asset quality while the quality of our assets declined as certain of our borrowers fell victim to the recession  our measures of asset quality continued to compare favorably with those of our industry peers 
non performing loans rose million year over year  to million  equivalent to of total loans at december st 
net charge offs rose million during this time  to million  which represented of average loans in to mitigate  and manage  our credit risk  we limited our production of acquisition  development  and construction loans and commercial and industrial loans  and increased our loan loss provisions over the course of the year 
we also stepped up our loan workout and collection efforts with the expansion of our loan recovery unit 
in addition  we focused our growth through acquisition strategy on fdic assisted acquisitions  to reduce the risk entailed in acquiring loans that we did not underwrite 
net interest income net interest income continued to be our primary source of income and rose million  or  over the course of the year 
capitalizing on the level of short term interest rates and the related steepness of the yield curve  we continued to lower our funding costs throughout in addition to allowing higher cost certificates of deposit cds to run off  and replacing them with lower cost deposits  we repurchased certain reit preferred and trust preferred securities and exchanged million of our bifurcated option note unit securities sm bonuses units for million shares of our common stock 
together  the repurchase of debt and the debt exchange added million after tax  or per diluted share  to our earnings  while at the same time contributing to the reduction in our cost of funds 
we also enhanced our funding mix through the amtrust acquisition  with deposits representing of total assets at december   an improvement from at december  while the average yields on our loans and assets declined  the impact was far exceeded by the benefit of substantial loan and asset growth 
reflecting both the loans we acquired and organic loan production  the average balance of loans rose billion  or  to billion  and the average balance of interest earning assets rose billion to billion  an increase of 

table of contents the same factors that contributed to the growth of our net interest income contributed to the expansion of our net interest margin in at  our margin was basis points wider than the measure recorded in the prior year 
efficiency we measure our efficiency by monitoring the ratio of our operating expenses to the combination of our net interest income and non interest income together  our revenues 
although our operating expenses were increased by the addition of amtrust s staff and operations and higher fdic insurance related expenses  the impact was exceeded by the increased revenues we produced 
as a result  our efficiency ratio in was 
our efficiency was  in some part  enhanced by the integration of the data processing systems used by our community bank branches in new york and new jersey 
as a result  our customers in these branches now have the option of conducting their business in any of our branches in these two states 
capital strength while the actions we took in resulted in the growth of our assets  deposits  and franchise  they also resulted in a significant level of capital strength 
tangible stockholders equity rose billion  or  to billion  and our ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets rose basis points to at year end 
please see the reconciliation of our stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity on page of this report 
these increases were  in large part  attributable to the positive response to our amtrust acquisition  which was followed by a successful common stock offering 
the offering generated net proceeds of million and resulted in our issuing million shares 
as a result of our actions in  we ended the year with assets of billion  deposits of billion  and a book value of per share 
we also produced earnings of million  equivalent to per diluted share 
reflecting the strength of our capital  as well as that of our earnings  we distributed dividends of million  collectively  to our investors  and maintained our quarterly cash dividend at per share throughout the year 
recent events dividend declaration on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the determination of whether an impairment of securities is other than temporary  the determination of the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment  which may result in changes to future financial results 
in addition  the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in our judgments  estimates  and assumptions 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings  and is reduced by net charge offs and or reversals  if any  that are credited to earnings 
loans are held by either the community bank or the commercial bank  and a separate loan loss allowance is established for each 
in addition  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each of the community bank and the commercial bank 
in determining the respective allowances for loan losses  management considers the community bank s and the commercial bank s current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with conservative guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
the allowances for loan losses are established based on our evaluation of the probable inherent losses in our portfolio in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the allowances for loan losses are comprised of both specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances which are determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards 
specific valuation allowances are established based on our analyses of individual loans that are considered impaired 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  management measures the extent of the impairment and establishes a specific valuation allowance for that amount 
a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply this classification as necessary to loans individually evaluated for impairment in our portfolios of multi family  commercial real estate  acquisition  development  and construction  and commercial and industrial loans 
smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value are evaluated for impairment on a collective rather than an individual basis 
we generally measure impairment on an individual loan and the extent to which a specific valuation allowance is necessary by comparing the loan s outstanding balance to either the fair value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to sell  or the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
a specific valuation allowance is established when the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated costs  or the present value of the expected cash flows  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
we also follow a process to assign general valuation allowances to loan catergories 
general valuation allowances are established by applying our loan loss provisioning methodology  and reflect the inherent risk in loans outstanding 
our loan loss provisioning methodology considers various factors in determining the appropriate quantified risk factors to use to determine the general valuation allowances 
the factors assessed begin with the historical loan loss experience for each of the major loan categories we maintain 
our historical loan loss experience is then adjusted by considering qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience  including  but not limited to  the following changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of non accrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of our loan review system  changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio 

table of contents by considering the factors discussed above  we determine quantified risk factors that are applied to each non impaired loan or loan type in the loan portfolio to determine the general valuation allowances 
in recognition of recent macroeconomic and real estate market conditions  the time periods considered for historical loss experience are the last three years and the current period 
we also evaluate the sufficiency of the overall allocations used for the loan loss allowance by considering the loss experience in the current calendar year 
the process of establishing the loan loss allowances also involves periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  assessment by the pertinent board of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank  as applicable 
we charge off loans  or portions of loans  in the period that such loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the collectability of individual loans is determined through an estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral and or an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower 
the level of future additions to the respective loan loss allowances is based on many factors  including certain factors that are beyond management s control such as changes in economic and local market conditions  including declines in real estate values  and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment 
management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans or to make additions to the loan loss allowances  however  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize further additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations of the banks 
investment securities the securities portfolio primarily consists of mortgage related securities and  to a lesser extent  debt and equity other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  less the non credit portion of otti recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax aocl 
the fair values of our securities and particularly our fixed rate securities are affected by changes in market interest rates and credit spreads 
in general  as interest rates rise and or credit spreads widen  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall and or credit spreads tighten  the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we regularly conduct a review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its current fair value  creating a new cost basis  and the resultant loss other than otti on debt securities attributable to non credit factors is charged against earnings and recorded in non interest income 
our assessment of a decline in fair value includes judgment as to the financial positions and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security  as well as a review of the security s underlying collateral 
broad changes in the overall market or interest rate environment generally will not lead to a conclusion that an otti loss should be recognized on a particular security 

table of contents prior to april   when the decline in fair value below an investment s carrying amount was deemed to be other than temporary  the investment was written down to fair value and the full amount of the write down was charged to the income statement 
a decline in fair value of an investment was deemed to be other than temporary if we did not expect to recover the carrying amount of the investment or we did not have the intent and ability to hold the investment to the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost 
effective april   with the adoption of revised otti accounting requirements issued by the fasb  unless we have the intent to sell  or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security  an otti is recognized as a realized loss on the income statement to the extent that the decline in fair value is credit related 
the decline in value attributable to factors other than credit is charged to aocl 
if there is a decline in fair value of a security below its carrying amount and we have the intent to sell it  or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security  the entire amount of the decline in fair value will be charged to the income statement 
at december   we had net unrealized losses of million on available for sale securities 
the securities impairments were deemed to be temporary and were principally based on the direct relationship of the declines in fair value to the movements in interest rates  including  in some cases  wider credit spreads  the effect of illiquidity on the market  the estimated remaining life and the credit quality of the investments  and our ability to hold  and our intent not to sell  before anticipated full recovery of amortized cost  which may not be until maturity 
in contrast  we had net unrealized gains on held to maturity securities of million 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step step is used to identify potential impairment  and involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step step is performed to measure the amount 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  ie  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangibles  as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination at the impairment test date 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has determined that the company has one reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying amount 
accordingly  as of the annual impairment test date  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
historically  we have used the quoted market price of our common stock on the impairment testing date as the basis for determining fair value 
as of january   the quoted market price of our common stock was per share  resulting in a market capitalization of billion  as compared to a net book value common stockholders equity of billion at december  given the negative variance of in the company s market capitalization  management enhanced the valuation methodology by using a discounted cash flow analysis dcfa 
the dcfa utilized observable market data to the extent available 
the discount rates utilized in the dcfa reflected market based estimates of capital costs and discount rates adjusted for management s assessment of a market participant s view with respect to execution  concentration  and other risks associated with the projected cash flows 
the results of the dcfa yielded a net book value in excess of fair value 
in addition to the dcfa  we reviewed the company s average market price for the one month period subsequent to december  and found that the average market price resulted in a market capitalization greater than the company s book value per share 

table of contents furthermore  management utilized a market premium approach to determine if there was any indication of goodwill impairment at january  this approach looks at the market value of the company s common stock  and estimates the fair value of the company based on the market value of the stock plus a control premium  and compares that value to the carrying amount of the company s stockholders equity 
under this method  management determined that there was no indication of goodwill impairment as of january  in determining the appropriate control premium  management took into consideration  among other factors  certain facts and circumstances unique to our company  as well as recent trends in market capitalization and control premiums used in comparable transactions 
we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january  and found no indication of goodwill impairment 
income taxes in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use the best available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall or transaction specific tax position 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
in july  new tax laws were enacted that were effective for the determination of our new york city income tax liability for calendar year in general  these laws conformed the new york city tax rules to those of new york state 
included in these new tax laws is a provision which requires the inclusion of income earned by a subsidiary taxed as a real estate investment trust reit for federal tax purposes  regardless of the location in which the reit subsidiary conducts its business or the timing of its distribution of earnings 
as a result of certain earlier business combinations  we currently have six reit subsidiaries 
the inclusion of such income is phased in with full inclusion of income starting in this new tax law increased our income tax expense in by million 
absent any change in the manner in which we conduct our business  current income tax expense is estimated to increase by approximately million in  with a larger increase starting in balance sheet summary at december   our assets totaled billion and were up billion  or  from the year earlier amount 
asset growth was primarily due to the amtrust acquisition  which provided one to four family mortgage and other loans of billion  available for sale securities of million  and cash and cash equivalents of billion  including billion in cash received from the fdic 
in addition to the assets acquired in the amtrust acquisition  our asset growth stemmed from loan originations of billion over the course of the year 

table of contents similarly  total liabilities rose billion  or  year over year  to billion  as deposits grew billion  or  to billion  and borrowed funds rose million to billion 
the increase in deposits was largely attributable to the amtrust acquisition  which provided deposits of billion at december  while the balance of borrowed funds was increased by the amtrust acquisition  the extent of the increase was limited by our deployment of cash acquired in the transaction to pay down certain wholesale borrowings and repurchase certain debt 
stockholders equity rose billion year over year to billion  representing of total assets and a book value of per share 
tangible stockholders equity rose billion during this time to billion  and represented of tangible assets and a tangible book value of per share 
please see the reconciliations of stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity and the related measures that appear on page of this report 
the year over year increases in the respective balances were primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our common stock offering in december and the sale of shares through the direct purchase feature of our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drp during the year 
loans at december   loans represented billion  or  of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  at december  included in the year end balance were the billion of loans acquired in the amtrust acquisition  all of which are subject to ie  covered by our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
these loans are referred to as covered loans on our consolidated statement of condition at december  the remainder of the loan portfolio consisted of non covered loans which were originated by the company or  in some cases  acquired in our merger transactions prior to originations totaled billion in  a billion reduction from the year earlier total  as the decline in real estate values and economic weakness in our market discouraged multi family and commercial real estate property owners from buying or refinancing properties 
included in the amount were loan originations for portfolio of billion and originations of one to four family loans held for sale of million 
in  originations of held for sale one to four family loans totaled million  the significant increase in was attributable to originations by amtrust s mortgage banking unit in december for sale to fannie mae and freddie mac 
although originations declined year over year  so too did loan sales and repayments  from billion in to billion in included in the amount were sales of one to four family loans totaling million  of this amount  loans of million were originated for sale by amtrust  the remainder were originated through our third party conduit 
loan origination analysis the following table summarizes our loan production for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands amount percent of total amount percent of total mortgage loan originations multi family commercial real estate acquisition  development  and construction one to four family held for sale one to four family held for portfolio total mortgage loan originations other loan originations commercial and industrial other total other loan originations total loan originations 
table of contents covered loans at december   covered loans consisted of billion of one to four family loans including both fixed and adjustable rate loans that were made to subprime  alt a  and prime borrowers  million of other loans helocs and consumer loans  and million of loans held for sale that were originated by amtrust s mortgage banking unit prior to the december th acquisition date 
the latter loans are recorded in the consolidated statement of condition as covered loans held for sale 
covered loans are referred to as such because they are subject to our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
the loss sharing agreements require the fdic to reimburse us for of losses up to million  and of losses beyond that initial amount with respect to the covered loans 
please see page of this report for a more detailed discussion of the fdic loss sharing agreements to which all the covered loans are subject 
non covered loans multi family loans multi family loans are our principal asset  and non luxury residential apartment buildings with below market rents in the new york metropolitan region constitute our primary lending niche 
consistent with our emphasis on multi family lending  multi family loan originations represented of the loans we produced in and of non covered loans outstanding at december  multi family loans rose billion year over year to billion  reflecting originations of billion over the twelve month period 
at december   the average multi family loan had a principal balance of million and the portfolio had an average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of  based on appraisals that primarily were received at the time of origination 
in  loan production was primarily constrained by the decline in real estate values and by continued economic uncertainty 
in addition  while competition for product was weak in the first half of the year  it began to pick up in the summer with the entry of new competitors and the return of fannie mae and freddie mac to our multi family lending niche 
we would expect to see a return to more normal loan production levels when the market becomes more stable and when an increase in market interest rates appears likely to occur 
our multi family loans are typically made to long term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to certain rent control and rent stabilization laws 
borrowers typically use the funds we provide to make improvements to the buildings and to certain apartments therein 
upon completion of these improvements  the property owners have the right to increase the rents paid by their tenants and  in doing so  can create more cash flows to borrow against in future years 
to a lesser extent  we make loans to building owners seeking to expand their real estate holdings with the purchase of additional properties 
in addition to underwriting our multi family loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition  we consider the borrowers credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the building s current rent rolls  their financial statements  and related documents 
our multi family loans typically feature a term of ten years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten 
the rate charged in the first five years is generally based on intermediate term interest rates plus a spread 
during years six through ten  the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread 
alternately  the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that  until january  was tied to the five year constant maturity treasury rate the five year cmt 
for loans originated since that date  the fixed rate in years six through ten has been tied to the fixed advance rate of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york the fhlb ny  plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan balance 
in either case  the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
as the rent roll increases  the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage  and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six 
while this cycle has repeated itself over the course of many decades  regardless of market interest rates and conditions  refinancing activity has been increasingly constrained by the uncertainty in the real estate market over the past two years  and is likely to be restrained while such uncertainty remains 
thus  in  contrary to our historical experience  certain borrowers took the fixed rate option for years six through ten 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at the end of this december  as compared to years at december  
table of contents multi family loans that refinance within the first five years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then current loan balance 
if a loan extends past the fifth year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option  the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten 
prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income and are therefore reflected in the average yields on our loans and assets  our interest rate spread and net interest margin  and the level of net interest income we record 
our success in our primary lending niche partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is significantly expedited  with loans taking four to six weeks to process  and the related expenses being substantially reduced 
at december   billion  or  of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings  with the remainder of the portfolio being secured by underlying mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings 
in addition  of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest share 
of the loans secured by buildings that are outside new york city  the state of new york was home to of our multi family credits  with new jersey and pennsylvania accounting for and  respectively 
the remaining of multi family loans were secured by buildings outside our primary market 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans in our specific niche 
notwithstanding an increase in non performing multi family loans in the current credit cycle  the amount of charged off multi family loans has  to date  been limited and has largely consisted of out of market non niche loans 
we attribute the difference between the amount of non performing loans we record and the actual losses we take to our underwriting standards and the generally conservative ltv ratios on the multi family loans we produce 
we primarily underwrite our multi family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the building  with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties  rather than the sales approach 
the sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market  as well as general economic conditions  and is therefore liable to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the physical condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the multi family loans we are originating today generally represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property  and typically feature an amortization period of up to years 
in addition to requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises  and an assignment of rents and leases 
accordingly  while our multi family lending niche has not been immune to the downturn of the credit cycle  we continue to believe that the multi family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans 
in general  buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable  with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time 
because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition  we believe that they are reasonably likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times 
in a ruling that was contrary to a advisory opinion from the new york state division of housing and community renewal that owners of housing units who benefited from the receipt of j tax incentives under the 
table of contents rent stabilization law are eligible to decontrol luxury apartments  the new york state court of appeals ruled  on october   that residential housing units located in two major housing complexes in new york city had been illegally decontrolled by the current and previous property owners 
although we are a major producer of multi family loans in new york city  the loans on these two properties are not in our portfolio 
in addition  because we underwrite our multi family loans on the basis of the current cash flows generated by the underlying properties excluding any j real estate tax benefits received by the property owners our business model is not dependent upon lending to property owners who place an emphasis on luxury decontrol 
accordingly  this ruling has not had a material impact on our multi family loan portfolio 
commercial real estate cre loans cre loans represented million  or  of the year s originations  as compared to billion  or  of the loans produced in while the growth of the portfolio was tempered by the level of repayments  cre loans totaled billion at the end of this december  a million increase from the balance recorded at december  at december   cre loans represented of non covered loans outstanding  as compared to at the prior year end 
the average cre loan had a principal balance of million at the end of this december  and the portfolio had an average ltv ratio at origination of 
at december   of our cre loans were secured by properties in new york city  with properties on long island and in new jersey accounting for and  respectively 
the cre loans we produce are secured by income producing properties such as office buildings  retail centers  mixed use buildings  and multi tenanted light industrial properties 
the pricing of our cre loans is structured along the same lines as our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediate term interest rates plus a spread 
during years six through ten  the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread 
alternately  the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that  until january  was tied to the five year cmt 
for loans originated since that date  the fixed rate in years six through ten has been tied to the fixed advance rate of the fhlb ny plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan balance 
in either case  the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
prepayment penalties also apply  with five percentage points of the then current balance generally being charged on loans that refinance in the first year  scaling down to one percentage point of the then current balance on loans that refinance in year five 
our cre loans tend to refinance within five years of origination 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  and years at december  if a loan remains outstanding in the sixth year  and the borrower selects the fixed rate option  a schedule of prepayment penalties ranging from five points to one point begins again in year six 
the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s current income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and generally requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of and a maximum ltv ratio of 
in addition  the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the personal property of the borrower and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
acquisition  development  and construction adc loans while the growth of our loan portfolio was fueled by multi family and cre lending  the increase was tempered by a reduction in adc loans 
in the interest of reducing our exposure to credit risk at a time when real estate values have been declining  we have  for the most part  limited our production of adc loans since the second half of to advances that were committed prior to the onset of the credit cycle turn 
as a result  originations declined by million  or  from the year earlier volume to million in adc loans represented million  or  of total non covered loans at december   representing a reduction from million at december  
table of contents at december   of the loans in our adc portfolio were for land acquisition and development  the remaining consisted of loans that were provided for the construction of owner occupied homes and commercial properties 
such loans are typically originated for terms of to months  and feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime  and a floor 
they also generate origination fees that are recorded as interest income and amortized over the lives of the loans 
in addition  of the loans in the adc portfolio were for properties in new york city  with manhattan accounting for more than half of new york city s share 
long island accounted for of our adc loans  with other parts of new york state and new jersey accounting for  combined 
in previous years  limited adc lending was done outside our immediate market and  even then  to borrowers we had lent to successfully within our marketplace 
because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk  especially during a downturn in the credit cycle  borrowers are required to provide a personal guarantee of repayment and completion during construction 
the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the property s value upon completion of construction  the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and the estimated time to complete and or sell or lease such property 
if the appraised value proves to be inaccurate  the cost of completion is greater than expected  or the length of time to complete and or sell or lease the collateral property is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
at december   of the loans in our adc loan portfolio were non performing  a result of the downturn in the credit cycle  and an indication of the length of time it has taken certain borrowers to sell or lease the properties underlying their loans 
when applicable  as a condition to closing a construction loan  it is our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of our loan 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 
we typically require pre leasing for loans on commercial properties 
one to four family loans although we offer one to four family loans  it has long been our policy to produce such loans on a pass through basis only  and to sell the loans we originate to the third party conduit shortly after they close 
reflecting this practice  as well as repayments of seasoned loans that were produced before its adoption or were acquired in our pre amtrust merger transactions  non covered one to four family loans declined million year over year to million  and represented less than of total non covered loans at december  in connection with this practice  we participate in a private label program with a nationally recognized third party mortgage originator the conduit  based on defined underwriting criteria 
the loans are marketed through our branches  including those acquired in the amtrust acquisition  as well as on our web sites 
the loans that we originate through the conduit program generate fees that are recorded as other non interest income in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
in addition to ensuring that our customers are provided with an extensive range of one to four family products  the conduit arrangement supports two of our primary objectives managing our exposure to interest rate risk and maintaining our efficiency 
with the addition of amtrust s mortgage banking unit  we now originate a far greater number of one to four family loans than we did before the acquisition  specifically consisting of agency conforming loans for sale to fannie mae and freddie mac 
the loans originated through the mortgage banking unit are made to borrowers on a nationwide platform  and in future periods will be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition  together with the loans originated through our conduit program  as non covered one to four family loans held for sale 
other loans our portfolio of other loans also declined in  by million  to million at december st 
commercial and industrial c i loans accounted for million of other loans at the end of december  as compared to million at december  of the million of other loans produced in the past four quarters  c i loan originations accounted for million  or 

table of contents c i loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers  and include term loans  demand loans  revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  and loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration 
a broad range of c i loans  both collateralized and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  business expansion  the purchase of machinery and equipment  and other general corporate needs 
in determining the tenor and structure of a c i loan  several factors are considered  including its purpose  the collateral  and the anticipated sources of repayment 
c i loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower  and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower s financial stability 
the interest rates on c i loans can be fixed or floating  with floating rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index  plus an applicable spread 
depending on the profitability of our relationship with the borrower  our floating rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest 
a benefit of c i lending is the opportunity to establish full scale banking relationships with our c i customers 
as a result  many of our borrowers provide us with deposits  and many take advantage of our cash management  investment  and trade finance services 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our pre amtrust merger partners prior to their joining the company 
we currently do not offer home equity loans or lines of credit 
geographical analysis of the loan portfolio the following table presents a geographical analysis of our multi family  cre  and adc loans all of which are non covered loans at december  at december  multi family loans commercial real estate loans acquisition  development  and and construction loans dollars in thousands amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total new york city manhattan brooklyn bronx queens staten island total new york city long island other new york state new jersey pennsylvania all other states total the covered loans acquired in the amtrust acquisition were made to borrowers throughout the united states  primarily for the purchase or refinancing of one to four family homes

table of contents lending authority the loans we originate for portfolio are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage and real estate committee of the board of directors of the community bank the mortgage committee  the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors 
in accordance with the banks policies  all loans of million or more are reported to the respective boards of directors 
in  loans of million or more were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in  such loans were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance at origination of billion 
we also place a limit on the amount of loans that may be made to one borrower 
at december   the largest concentration of loans to one borrower consisted of a million multi family loan provided by the community bank to riverbay corporation co op city  a residential community with  units in the bronx  new york  which was created under new york state s mitchell lama housing program in the late s to provide affordable housing for middle income residents of the state 
the loan was originated on september  at an interest rate of 
at october   the interest rate on the loan was 
as of december   the loan has been current since its origination 
mortgage banking unit with the amtrust acquisition  we acquired a mortgage banking unit that is currently originating only agency conforming one to four family loans for sale to fannie mae and freddie mac 
in connection with the activities of the mortgage banking unit  we have certain interest rate lock commitments to fund loans and other derivative financial instruments that obligate us to sell loans at specific dates in the future at specified prices 
these commitments are considered derivatives  and are carried at fair value 
most forward commitments to sell are entered into with primary dealers 
entering into commitments to sell loans can pose a risk if we are not able to deliver the loans on the appropriate delivery date 
if we are unable to meet our obligation  we may be required to pay a fee to the counterparty 
we may retain the servicing on loans that we sell  in which case we would recognize a mortgage servicing right msr asset 
we estimate prepayment rates based on current interest rate levels  other economic conditions  and market forecasts  as well as relevant characteristics of the servicing portfolio 
generally  when market interest rates decline  prepayments increase as customers refinance their existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms 
when a mortgage prepays  or when loans are expected to prepay earlier than originally expected  the anticipated cash flows associated with servicing these loans are terminated or reduced  resulting in a reduction to the fair value of the capitalized msrs and a reduction in earnings 
msrs are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded as a component of non interest income in each period 

table of contents loan maturity and repricing analysis the following table sets forth the maturity or period to repricing of our loan portfolio at december  loans that have adjustable rates are shown as being due in the period during which the interest rates are next subject to change

commitments to originate one to four family loans all of which will be sold totaled million at december   as compared to million at december   with the difference primarily being attributable to amtrust s mortgage banking unit 
in addition to loan commitments  we had commitments to issue financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit totaling million at december  the commitments featured terms ranging from one to three years and are collateralized 
financial stand by letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions or municipalities  on behalf of certain of our current borrowers  and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation 
performance letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers 
these borrowers are mainly developers of residential subdivisions with whom we currently have a lending relationship 
performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non financial contractual obligations 

table of contents commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer 
although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions  the majority are used to settle payments in international trade 
typically  such letters of credit require presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction  and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
asset quality the economic crisis that began in the second half of showed few signs of abating as unemployment continued to rise  more businesses faltered  and real estate values declined through most of although the initial shock of the crisis faded away  its far reaching impact continued  posing a challenge to both borrowers and lenders alike 
the following discussion refers to our non covered loans only  as the covered loans we acquired in the amtrust acquisition are considered to be performing  as discussed on page under covered loans 
the impact of these economic forces was reflected in our non performing assets and net charge offs  both of which rose substantially in at million  net charge offs represented of average loans in  as compared to million  representing of average loans  in multi family loans accounted for million of the net charge offs  with adc loans and other loans accounting for million and million  respectively 
in  the majority of our net charge offs consisted of adc and other loans 
non performing loans rose to million in from the prior year s million  and represented and of total loans  respectively 
the increase in non performing loans was attributable to a million rise in non accrual mortgage loans to million and a million rise in non accrual other loans to million 
the increase in non accrual mortgage loans was largely due to a million increase in loans secured by multi family buildings  most of which were located outside our primary lending niche  as described earlier under multi family loans 
although the reasons for this increase vary from credit to credit  such loans do not typically result in significant losses  given the value of the cash flows such buildings generate 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is over days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
when necessary  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
workout specialists from our loan recovery unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment 
in addition  outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned oreo  and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property 
at december   oreo totaled million as compared to million at the previous year end 
it is our policy to require an appraisal and environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure  and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the property s condition 
reflecting the increase in non performing loans and oreo  non performing assets rose million year over year to million  representing of total assets at december  at december   the comparable ratio was 
in addition  loans to days past due totaled million at the end of this december  a million increase from the year end amount 

table of contents to mitigate the potential for credit risk  we underwrite our loans in accordance with prudent credit standards 
in the case of multi family and cre loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated to determine the property s economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value more typically used 
the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
multi family buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on multi family loans originated in excess of million 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on cre loans in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on collateral properties 
in addition  we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years 
in addition  in new york city  where of the buildings securing our multi family loans are located  the rents that tenants may be charged on the apartments in certain buildings is restricted under certain rent control or rent stabilization laws 
as a result  the average rents that tenants pay in such apartments are generally lower than current market rents 
buildings with a preponderance of such rent regulated apartments are  therefore  less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity 
to further manage our credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower  and typically require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of for multi family loans and for cre loans 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the current average ltv ratios of such credits were well below those amounts at december   as previously noted 
exceptions to these ltv limitations are reviewed on a case by case basis  requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s current income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  in addition  the origination of cre loans typically requires an assignment of the rents and or leases 
the boards of directors also take part in the adc lending process  with all adc loans requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the pertinent committee participates in inspections when the loan amount exceeds million 
adc loans have primarily have been made to well established builders who have worked with us or our merger partners in the past 
we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of multi family and residential tract projects  however  in the case of home construction loans to individuals  the limit is 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of the property 
credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
c i loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  and are generally collateralized by various business assets  including  but not limited to  inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the operating results of the business 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for c i loans 
our loan portfolio has been structured to manage our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and cre loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to five years of origination  and the duration of adc loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by buildings with rent regulated apartments that tend to maintain a high level of occupancy  regardless of economic conditions in our marketplace 

table of contents the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories  with late charges assessed  and notices mailed to the borrower  at specified dates 
we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action 
delinquencies are addressed by our loan recovery unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings 
while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  the severity of the credit cycle has resulted in an increase in non performing loans and assets  as well as net charge offs 
in view of the weakened economy and the increase in non performing assets and net charge offs  we increased our allowance for loan losses in the allowance for loan losses rose million  or  year over year to million  as net charge offs of million were exceeded by loan loss provisions of million 
in  the provision for loan losses totaled million and exceeded that year s net charge offs by million 
at december   the allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of non performing loans 
the manner in which the allowance for loan losses is established  and the assumptions made in that process  are considered critical to our financial condition and results 
such assumptions are based on judgments that are difficult  complex  and subjective regarding various matters of inherent uncertainty 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these judgments 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
based upon all relevant and available information  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was appropriate at that date 
historically  our level of charge offs has been relatively low in adverse credit cycles  even when the volume of non performing loans has increased 
this distinction has largely been due to the nature of our primary lending niche multi family loans collateralized by non luxury residential apartment buildings in the new york metropolitan region that have a preponderance of apartments with below market rents  and to our conservative underwriting practices that require  among other things  low ltv ratios 
despite the rise in non performing multi family loans in  we would not expect to see a comparable increase in losses 
this is primarily due to the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure upon which these loans are based 
low ltv ratios provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit 
furthermore  in many cases  low ltv ratios result in our having fewer loans with a potential for the borrower to walk away from the property 
although borrowers may default on loan payments  they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return the loan to performing status 
similarly  an increase in cre loans would not necessarily be expected to result in a corresponding increase in our loan loss allowance for such credits 
at december   cre loans represented of non covered loans outstanding  an basis point increase from the year earlier amount 
charge offs of cre loans represented of total charge offs in the current twelve month period and in the twelve months ended december  we believe this favorable loan loss experience is due to our historical practice of underwriting cre loans in accordance with standards similar to those we follow in underwriting our multi family loans 
in  we continued to de emphasize the production of adc and other loans  as well as one to four family loans for portfolio  in order to mitigate credit risk 
at december   adc  other loans  and one to four family loans represented   and  respectively  of loans outstanding  as compared to   and  respectively  at december  at december     and of adc  other loans  and one to four family loans were non performing  respectively 
although adc  other loans  and one to four family loans each 
table of contents represented a smaller percentage of loans outstanding  the level of the loan loss allowance for such loans at december  either increased or remained consistent with the year earlier level  reflecting the trend in non performing loans and our ongoing assessment of the risk inherent in these portfolios 
in view of these factors  we believe that a significant increase in non performing loans will not necessarily result in a comparable increase in loan losses and  accordingly  will not necessarily require a significant increase in our loan loss allowance or in the provision for loan losses recorded in any given period 
as indicated  while non performing loans represented of total loans at december   the ratio of net charge offs to average loans for the twelve months ended at that date was 
the allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with the methodology described earlier in this report under critical accounting policies 
covered loans although the amtrust acquisition increased our loan portfolio by billion  the credit risk associated with the acquired loans was substantially mitigated by the community bank s loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic will reimburse us for of losses and share in of any recoveries up to million and reimburse us for of any losses and share in of any recoveries with respect to losses exceeding that initial amount 
the loss sharing and reimbursement agreement applicable to one to four family mortgage loans and helocs is effective for a ten year period 
the loss sharing agreement applicable to consumer loans provides for the fdic to reimburse us for losses for a five year period  the period for sharing in recoveries on consumer loans extends for a period of eight years 
we consider the covered loans to be performing due to the application of the yield accretion method under codification topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
topic allows us to aggregate credit impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools  provided that the loans have common risk characteristics 
a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows 
accordingly  loans that may have been classified as non performing loans by amtrust are no longer classified as non performing because  at acquisition  we believe we will fully collect the new carrying value of these loans 
the new carrying value represents the contractual balance  reduced by the portion expected to be uncollectible referred to as the non accretable difference and by an accretable yield discount that is recognized as interest income 
it is important to note that management s judgment is required in reclassifying loans subject to codification topic as performing loans  and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of the cash flows to be collected  even if the loan is contractually past due 
in addition  the community bank agreed to pay to the fdic on january  the true up measurement date  half of the amount  if positive  calculated as  minus the sum of a of the asset discount bid made in connection with the amtrust acquisition  b of the cumulative shared loss payments as defined in the agreements  and c the sum of the period servicing amounts for every consecutive twelve month period prior to  and ending on  the true up measurement date in respect of each of the shared loss agreements during which the applicable shared loss agreement is in effect 
these reimbursable losses and recoveries are based on the book value of the relevant loans and other assets as determined by the fdic as of the effective date of the acquisition 
the amount that the community bank realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value that will be reflected in any financial statements  based upon the timing and amount of collections and recoveries on the covered loans in future periods 
in connection with the loss sharing agreements  we established an fdic loss share receivable in the amount of million  which was the acquisition date fair value of the loss sharing agreements expected reimbursements from the fdic over the terms of the agreements 
the loss share receivable may increase if the losses increase  and may decrease if the losses fall short of the expected amount 
gains and recoveries on covered loans will offset losses or be paid to the fdic at the applicable loss share percentage at the time of recovery 
in addition  the one to four family loans originated for sale by amtrust s mortgage banking unit are underwritten to fannie mae and freddie mac standards 
at the time of sale  certain representations and warranties with regard to the underwriting and documentation of these loans are made 
we may be required to repurchase the loans from fannie mae and freddie mac if it is found that a breach of the representations and warranties was made at the time of sale 

table of contents asset quality analysis the following table presents information regarding our consolidated allowance for loan losses  non performing assets  and delinquencies at each year end in the five years ended december  covered loans are considered to be performing due to the application of the yield accretion method  as discussed on page of this report

in general  the modification or restructuring of a loan constitutes a troubled debt restructuring when we grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on non accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for a period of at least six months 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring  all of which had non accrual status  totaled million at december  there were no troubled debt restructurings at any of the previous year ends included in the preceding asset quality analysis

these cash flows stem from the repayment of principal and interest  in addition to the sale of such securities 
held to maturity securities also generate cash flows from repayments and serve as a source of earnings 
securities expected to be held for an indefinite period of time are classified as available for sale 
a decision to purchase or sell these securities is based on economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and our asset and liability management strategy 
all of the securities acquired in the amtrust acquisition were classified as available for sale

sources of funds the parent company i 
e  the company on an unconsolidated basis has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends  share repurchases  and other corporate uses capital raised through the issuance of stock  dividends paid to the company by the banks  funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments  and repayments of  and income from  investment securities 
on a consolidated basis  our funding primarily stems from the deposits we acquire in our business combinations or gather through our branch network  and brokered deposits  the use of borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings  the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities  and the cash flows generated through the sale of loans and securities 
in  these funding sources were complemented by the amtrust related infusion of billion in cash and cash equivalents

deposits represented of total assets at the end of this december  an improvement from at year end while the vast majority of our deposits  historically  have been acquired through business combinations or gathered through our branch network  our mix of deposits has also included brokered cds and brokered money market accounts 
depending on the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources  we typically refrain from pricing our retail deposits at the higher end of the market in order to contain or reduce our funding costs 
cds represented billion  or  of total deposits at the end of december  and were up billion  or  year over year 
brokered cds accounted for million of the december  balance  down from billion of the balance at december  the balance of cds at december  also includes cds in excess of  that feature preferential rates of interest and are accepted by both the community bank and the commercial bank

table of contents billion  and non interest bearing accounts rising million to billion 
the increase in the balance of now and money market accounts was partially due to a billion increase in brokered money market accounts to billion at year end borrowed funds borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings ie  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  and federal funds purchased  junior subordinated debentures  and other borrowed funds consisting primarily of preferred stock of subsidiaries and senior notes 
the cost of borrowed funds is largely based on short term rates of interest  the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the federal open market committee of the federal reserve board of governors the fomc 
the fomc reduces  maintains  or increases the target federal funds rate as it deems necessary 
while the target federal funds rate declined dramatically in  from in january to a range of to basis points in december  the rate was maintained at that historically low range throughout in the interest of reducing our cost of funds and enhancing our net interest margin  we used a portion of the cash received in the amtrust acquisition to pay down the repurchase agreements we acquired 
in the third quarter of  we exchanged shares of our common stock for bonuses units  and in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased certain reit and trust preferred securities 
wholesale borrowings although wholesale borrowings of billion were assumed in the amtrust acquisition  we utilized a portion of the cash received in that transaction to pay down million of such borrowings before the end of the year 
as a result  wholesale borrowings rose million from the december  balance to billion at december  fhlb advances represented billion of wholesale borrowings at the end of this december  a billion increase from the balance at december  included in the year end amount were billion of fhlb cincinnati advances that were acquired in the amtrust acquisition

also included in wholesale borrowings at year end were repurchase agreements of billion  down million from the balance at december  repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the banks with an agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed upon price and date 
our repurchase agreements are primarily collateralized by gse obligations  and may be entered into with the fhlb ny or certain brokerage firms 
the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to our ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default 
in addition  a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for the brokerage firms we use 
while the balance of wholesale borrowings at year end included overnight federal funds purchased of million  we had no federal funds purchased at year end a significant portion of our wholesale borrowings at year end consisted of callable advances and callable repurchase agreements 
at december   billion of our wholesale borrowings were callable in and billion were callable in given the current interest rate environment  we do not expect these borrowings to be called 
junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures declined to million at december  from million at december  the reduction was due to the exchange of bonuses units for common stock in the third quarter  and the repurchase of new york community capital trust xi securities in the fourth quarter of the year 

table of contents other borrowings other borrowings totaled million at december   as compared to million at the prior year end
