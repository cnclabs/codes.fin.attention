overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since has been the managing attorney in fact for the subscribers of the erie insurance exchange exchange  a reciprocal insurer that writes property casualty insurance 
our primary function is to perform certain services relating to sales  underwriting and issuance of policies on behalf of the exchange 
we earn a management fee from the exchange for these services 
we have three operating segments management operations  insurance operations and investment operations 
management operations our earnings are driven primarily by the management fee revenue we collect from the exchange that is based on the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group and the management fee rate we charge 
because of this 
table of contents relationship  our income from management operations is directly impacted by the cyclical nature of the insurance industry 
the property casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity 
the property casualty insurance industry is in stable financial condition however  the economic recession has reduced premium and loss exposures affecting the financial performance of the industry 
industry premium exposures in both personal and commercial lines continued to be suppressed in  with premium rates for personal lines showing some firming and most commercial lines still reflecting rate reductions 
our management fee revenue reflected growth of in  as the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group increased compared to the property and casualty group grew premiums in through increased new policies sold and stable policyholder retention 
while modest price increases were implemented in  they were offset by exposure reductions and changes in our mix of business which reduced our average premium per policy 
we expect our pricing actions in to result in a net increase in direct written premiums  however  delayed economic recovery could adversely impact the average premium written of the property and casualty group 
the management fee is calculated as a percentage  not to exceed  of the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the board of directors establishes the rate at least annually and considers such factors as relative financial strength of the exchange and company and projected revenue streams 
our board set the rate at  its maximum level 
insurance underwriting operations we generate revenues from our property casualty insurance subsidiaries  which consist of our share of the pooled insurance business of the property and casualty group 
members of the property and casualty group participate in an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement where all insurance business is pooled in the exchange 
under the pooling agreement  the exchange assumes of the property and casualty group s underwriting results 
through the pool  our subsidiaries erie insurance company and erie insurance company of new york  currently assume of the property and casualty group s underwriting results  providing a direct incentive for us to manage the insurance underwriting discipline as effectively as possible 
the property casualty insurance business is driven by premium growth and the combined ratio 
the property and casualty group s premium growth strategy focuses on growth by expansion of existing operations including a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in existing operating territories 
expanding the size of our existing agency force of over  independent agencies will contribute to future growth as new agents build up their books of business with the property and casualty group 
the property and casualty group appointed new agencies in we plan to appoint a similar number of agencies during the property and casualty group focuses on insuring standard and preferred risks and adheres to a set of consistent underwriting standards 
nearly of premiums are derived from personal auto  from homeowners and from commercial lines 
the combined ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to premiums earned expense ratio 
when the combined ratio is less than  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is greater than  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
factors affecting loss and loss expenses include the frequency and severity of losses  the nature and severity of catastrophic losses  the quality of risks underwritten and underlying claims and settlement expenses related to medical costs and litigation 
both personal lines and commercial lines net written premiums are experiencing highly competitive market conditions with the recessionary economic conditions 
a light catastrophe season for the industry  coupled with some recovery in the financial markets  indicate increasing industry surplus and underwriting capacity 
despite an increase in loss cost drivers as a result of an increasing frequency trend  the property and casualty group has experienced lower losses  primarily due to a reduction in large claims 
the property and casualty group s economically sensitive lines  such as workers compensation and commercial auto  experienced reduced exposures and reduced average premium per policy due to economic conditions 

table of contents investment operations we generate revenues from our fixed maturity  equity security and alternative investment portfolios 
the portfolios are managed with a view toward maximizing after tax yields and limiting credit risk  and management actively evaluates the portfolios for impairments 
we record impairment writedowns on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
our investment operations  while still showing overall losses driven primarily from our alternative investments  reflected the improvement experienced in the financial markets in the latter half of during  we impaired million of securities compared to million in the decrease in our impairments included the change in impairment policy as a result of the new impairment guidance for debt securities effective for the second quarter of as a result  only debt securities that have a credit related issue  or we intend to sell  or more than likely will be required to sell  are now included as impairments recognized in earnings 
unrealized gains losses on our investment portfolio showed improvements due to more favorable market conditions during net unrealized gains on fixed maturities were million at december   compared to million in net unrealized losses at december  net unrealized gains in equity securities were million at december   compared to million in unrealized losses at december  our trading securities portfolio was similarly affected  with a net unrealized gain of million at december   compared to million of unrealized losses at december  our alternative investments were impacted by the weak financial market conditions in the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of in particular  the downturn in the commercial real estate market had a significant impact on the portfolios of our real estate partnerships 
equity in losses of limited partnerships were million in compared to gains of million in the valuation adjustments in the limited partnerships are based on financial statements received from our general partners  which are generally received on a quarter lag 
as a result  the partnership earnings do not reflect the valuation changes from the fourth quarter of financial overview years ended december  change change over over in thousands  except per share data income from management operations underwriting income net loss revenue from investment operations   nm  income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income per share diluted nm not meaningful key points increase in net income per share diluted in was impacted by improved performance in our investment operations overall as the financial markets showed signs of recovery in compared to gross margins from management operations increased to in from in gaap combined ratios of the insurance underwriting operations increased to in from in favorable development of prior accident year loss reserves improved the combined ratio by points and points in and  respectively 
management operations management fee revenue increased and in and  respectively 
the two components of management fee revenue are the management fee rate we charge  and the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the management fee rate was for both and the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group were billion in compared to billion in 
table of contents in  the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group increased compared to in policies in force grew in  compared to in the growth in policies in force for both years is the result of continuing strong policyholder retention rates and increased new policies sold 
reductions in the average premium per policy were in compared to in while modest rate increases were implemented in  these were offset by exposure reductions and changes in our mix of business  which resulted in a slight decrease in our average premium per policy in rate reductions implemented by the property and casualty group were the primary driver of the reduction in the average premium per policy in the cost of management operations increased  or million  to million in  primarily due to an increase in non commission expenses commissions total commission costs decreased  or million  to million in driven by a decrease in agent bonuses as a result of a reduction in the profitability component of the award 
offsetting this reduction were increases in normal scheduled rate commissions and other promotional incentives 
total costs other than commissions all other non commission expense increased  to million in personnel costs increased primarily due to higher pension benefit costs and increased management incentive plan expense 
increased salaries and wages were offset by the capitalization of internal labor costs related to various technology initiatives 
survey and underwriting costs rose due to increased application activity 
other operating cost increases were driven by contract labor costs related to various technology initiatives

table of contents reconciliation of operating income to net income we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by the disclosure of the following non gaap financial measure 
our method of calculating this measure may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 
operating income is net income excluding realized capital gains and losses  impairment losses and related federal income taxes 
we elected the fair value measurement option for our common stock portfolio effective january  as such  changes in value related to common stocks are reported in earnings 
these unrealized gains or losses are included in the net realized gains losses on investments in our consolidated statements of operations that is used to calculate operating income 
equity in earnings or losses of efl and equity in earnings or losses of limited partnerships are not excluded from the calculation of operating income 
equity in earnings or losses of limited partnerships includes the respective investment s realized capital gains and losses  as well as unrealized gains and losses 
net income is the generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure that is most directly comparable to operating income 
we use operating income to evaluate the results of operations 
it reveals trends in our management services  insurance underwriting and investment operations that may be obscured by the net effects of realized capital gains and losses including impairment losses 
realized capital gains and losses including impairment losses  may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as capital market conditions  the timing of which is unrelated to our management services and insurance underwriting processes 
we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance 
we are aware that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by investors as a forward looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator 
operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect our overall profitability 
the following table reconciles operating income and net income for the periods ended december change change over over in thousands  except per share data operating income net realized losses and impairments on investments  nm  nm  income tax benefit nm  nm  realized losses and impairments  net of income taxes  nm  nm  net income per class a share diluted operating income net realized losses and impairments on investments nm nm income tax benefit nm nm realized losses and impairments  net of income taxes nm nm net income nm not meaningful the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of equity in losses of limited partnerships of million in compared to earnings of million in critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 

table of contents the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually  and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings 
investment valuation we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments 
valuation techniques are used to derive the fair value of the available for sale and trading securities we hold 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date 
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
for purposes of determining whether the market is active or inactive  the classification of a financial instrument was based on the following definitions an active market is one in which transactions for the assets being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information 
an inactive illiquid market is one in which there are few and infrequent transactions  where the prices are not current  price quotations vary substantially  and or there is little information publicly available for the asset being valued 
we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date re evaluate the classification in the fair value hierarchy 
all assets carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets not subject to adjustments or discounts 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable and reflect management s estimate of fair value based on assumptions used by market participants in an orderly transaction as of the valuation date 
level primarily consists of publicly traded common stock  nonredeemable preferred stocks and treasury securities and reflects market data obtained from independent sources  such as prices obtained from an exchange or a nationally recognized pricing service for identical instruments in active markets 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry standard models that consider various inputs  such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments 
all significant inputs are observable  or derived from observable information in the marketplace  or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
financial instruments in this category primarily include municipal securities  asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  foreign and domestic corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and certain nonredeemable preferred stocks 
level securities are valued based upon unobservable inputs  reflecting our estimates of value based on assumptions used by market participants 
securities are assigned to level in cases where non binding broker quotes are significant to the valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace 
fair value estimates for securities valued using unobservable inputs require significant judgment due to the illiquid nature of the market for these securities and represent the best estimate of the fair value that would occur in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the 
table of contents measurement date under current market conditions 
fair value for these securities are generally determined using comparable securities or non binding broker quotes received from outside broker dealers based on security type and market conditions 
remaining un priced securities are valued using an estimate of fair value based on indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based on  nor corroborated by  market information  including the utilization of discounted cash flow analyses which have been risk adjusted to take into account illiquidity and other market factors 
this category primarily consists of certain private preferred stock and bond securities  collateralized debt and loan obligations  and credit linked notes 
as of each reporting period  financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the presence of at least one unobservable input would result in classification as a level instrument 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset  such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions 
we did not make any other significant judgments except as described above 
estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service 
our level category includes those securities valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service 
the methodologies used by the pricing service that support a level classification of a financial instrument include multiple verifiable  observable inputs including benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
pricing service valuations for level securities are based on proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available in illiquid markets 
in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when in our judgment a better reflection of fair value is available based on corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and or non binding broker quotes 
we perform continuous reviews of the prices obtained from the pricing service 
this includes evaluating the methodology and inputs used by the pricing service to ensure we determine the proper level classification of the financial instrument 
price variances  including large periodic changes  are investigated and corroborated by market data 
we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service and believe that their prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value 
in cases in which a price from the pricing service is not available  values are determined by obtaining non binding broker quotes and or market comparables 
when available  we obtain multiple quotes for the same security 
the ultimate value for these securities is determined based on our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information 
our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
investments are evaluated monthly for other than temporary impairment loss 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost  historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer  short and long term prospects of the issuer and its industry based on analysts recommendations  specific events that occurred affecting the issuer  including rating downgrades  our intent to sell or more likely than not be required to sell debt securities  and our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value equity securities 
for debt securities in which we do not expect full recovery of amortized cost  the security is deemed to be credit impaired 
credit related impairments and impairments on securities we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
it is our intention to sell all debt securities with credit impairments 
for available for sale equity securities  a charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for positions that have experienced other than temporary impairments due to credit quality or other factors 
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests is financial statements prepared by the general partner 
because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements  the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners generally result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations 
due to this delay  these financial statements do not reflect the market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter we expect additional deterioration  
table of contents primarily from our real estate partnerships  to be reflected in the general partners year end financial statements  which we will receive in nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets 
our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value 
several factors are to be considered in determining whether an entity is an investment company 
among these factors are a large number of investors  low level of individual ownership and passive ownership that indicate the entity is an investment company 
we have three types of limited partnership investments private equity  mezzanine debt and real estate 
our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are diversified among numerous industries and geographies to minimize potential loss exposure 
the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based on the financial statements of the general partners  who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach  income approach and the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset 
if information becomes available that would impair the cost of investments owned by the partnerships  then the general partner would generally adjust to the net realizable value 
real estate limited partnerships are recorded by the general partner at fair value based on independent appraisals and or internal valuations 
real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner 
we minimize the risk of market decline by avoiding concentration in a particular geographic area and are diversified across residential  commercial  industrial and retail real estate investments 
we perform various procedures in review of the general partners valuations  and while we rely on the general partners financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes  we adjust our financial statements for impairments of the partnership investments where appropriate 
as there is no ready market for these investments  they have the greatest potential for variability 
we survey each of the general partners quarterly about expected significant changes plus or minus compared to previous quarter to valuations prior to the release of the fund s quarterly and annual financial statements 
based on that information from the general partner  we consider whether additional disclosure is warranted 
property casualty insurance liabilities reserves for property casualty insurance unpaid losses and loss expenses reflect our best estimate of future amounts needed to pay losses and related expenses with respect to insured events 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported 
they also include estimates of all future payments associated with processing and settling these claims 
reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims 
case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claims 
incurred but not reported reserves represent the difference between the actual reported loss and loss expenses and the estimated ultimate cost of all claims 
the process of estimating the liability for property casualty unpaid loss and loss expense reserves is complex and involves a variety of actuarial techniques 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past development trends are an appropriate indicator of future events 
reserve estimates are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstances  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by internal factors  including changes in claims handling procedures and changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process  and external events  such as economic inflation  regulatory and legislative changes 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final loss settlements may vary significantly from the current estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
our actuaries review reserve estimates for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data  on a quarterly basis  for all direct reserves except the reserves for the pre automobile massive injury claims and the workers compensation massive injury claims which are reviewed semi annually 
these massive injury reserves are reviewed semi annually because of the relatively low number of cases and the long term nature of these claims 
for reserves that are reviewed semi annually  our actuaries monitor the emergence of paid and reported losses in the 
table of contents intervening quarters to either confirm that the estimate of ultimate losses should not change  or if necessary  perform a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change 
significant changes to the factors discussed above  which are either known or reasonably projected through analysis of internal and external data  are quantified in the reserve estimates each quarter 
the quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis 
the various methods generate different estimates of ultimate losses by product line and product coverage combination 
thus  there are no reserve ranges  but rather point estimates of the ultimate losses developed from the various methods 
the methods that are considered more credible vary by product coverage combination based primarily on the maturity of the accident quarter  the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the method 
paid loss development patterns  generated from historical data  are generally less useful for the more recent accident quarters of long tailed lines since a low percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development 
reported loss including cumulative paid losses and case reserves development patterns  generated from historical data  estimate only the unreported losses rather than the total unpaid losses as this technique is affected by changes in case reserving practices 
combinations of the paid and reported methods are used in developing estimated ultimate losses for short tail coverages  such as private passenger auto property and homeowners claims  and more mature accident quarters of long tail coverages  such as private passenger auto liability claims and commercial liability claims  including workers compensation 
the bornhuetter ferguson method combines a reported development technique with an expected loss ratio technique 
an expected loss ratio is developed through a review of historical loss ratios by accident quarter  as well as expected changes to earned premium  mix of business and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the accident quarter being evaluated 
this method is generally used on the first four to eight accident quarters on long tail coverages because a low percentage of losses are paid in the early period of development 
the reserve review process involves a comprehensive review by our actuaries of the various estimation methods and reserve levels produced by each 
these multiple reserve point estimates are reviewed by our reserving actuaries and reserve best estimates are selected 
the selected reserve estimates are discussed with management 
numerous factors are considered in setting reserve levels  including  but not limited to  the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications  the maturity of the accident year  pertinent claims frequency and severity trends observed over recent years  the level of volatility within a particular line of business and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods 
we also perform analyses to evaluate the adequacy of past reserve levels 
using subsequent information  we perform retrospective reserve analyses to test whether previously established estimates for reserves were reasonable 
our retrospective reserve analysis indicated the property and casualty group s december  direct reserves  excluding salvage and subrogation recoveries  had an estimated redundancy of approximately million  which was of reserves at december  our share of this favorable development was million 
workers compensation reserves were reduced in by the settlement of eight massive injury workers compensation claims related to the accident year 
in  the mortality assumptions used for massive injury workers compensation claims was changed to a weighting of the disabled pensioner mortality table and gender specific mortality tables were used 
in  our mortality assumption gave weighting to our own experience and weighting to the disabled pensioner mortality table 
additionally  the workers compensation discount on reserves increased in as a result of segregating massive injury workers compensation claims  which have longer payout patterns  from other workers compensation claims in the discount calculation 
the property and casualty group s workers compensation reserves were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves on pre automobile massive injury reserves were increased million in in  the mortality assumptions used for pre automobile massive injury claims was changed to a weighting of the disabled pensioner mortality table and gender specific mortality tables were used 
the property and casualty group had pre automobile massive injury reserves of million at december  and million at december   which are net of million and million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables for and  respectively 

table of contents in and  the property and casualty group s direct reserves had an estimated redundancy at december of million  or of reserves  and million  or of reserves  respectively 
in  the property and casualty group reduced automobile bodily injury and uninsured underinsured motorist um uim reserves by approximately million primarily due to improved frequency trends 
the pre automobile massive injury claims were reduced approximately million in driven by lower than expected future attendant care costs 
in  the favorable frequency and severity trends in automobile bi and um uim that began in became more fully developed 
the property and casualty group s coverage with the greatest potential for variation are the massive injury reserves 
the automobile no fault law in pennsylvania before and workers compensation policies provide for unlimited medical benefits 
the estimate of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health  mortality over time and health care cost trends 
workers compensation massive injury claims have been segregated from the total population of workers compensation claims 
because the coverage related to the automobile no fault and workers compensation claims is unique and the number of claims is about  the previously discussed methods are not used  rather ultimate losses are estimated on a claim by claim basis 
an annual payment assumption is made for each of these claimants who sustained massive injuries and then projected into the future based upon a particular assumption of the future inflation rate  including medical inflation and life expectancy of the claimant 
the most significant variable in estimating this liability is medical cost inflation 
changes were also made in to mortality assumptions and the discount calculation 
our medical inflation rate assumption in setting this reserve for is an annual increase grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
our medical inflation rate assumption in setting this reserve for was a annual increase grading down after the first year  then grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
the property and casualty group massive injury reserves were reduced million as a result of this change 
our share of this reserve change was million 
the mortality rate assumption in gives weighting to the disabled pensioner mortality table by gender 
in  our mortality rate assumption gave weighting to our own mortality experience and weighting to the male female combined disabled pensioner mortality table 
we believe weighting the mortality assumption to incorporate the disabled pensioner mortality table by gender  which more appropriately weighs male and female life expectancies  is reasonable in estimating our ultimate liability for these claims 
actual experience  different than that assumed  could have a significant impact on the reserve estimate 
the property and casualty group massive injury reserves increased million as a result of this change 
our share of this reserve change was million 
loss reserves are set at full expected cost  except for workers compensation loss reserves  which are discounted on a nontabular basis using an interest rate of based upon the property and casualty group s historical workers compensation payout patterns 
in  we changed our workers compensation discounting method to segregate the workers compensation massive injury claims that have longer payout patterns in the discount calculation from the non massive injury workers compensation claims 
the property and casualty group workers compensation reserves were reduced by million related to this change 
our share of this change was million 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for the pre automobile massive injury liabilities  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty subsidiaries share of the net automobile massive injury liability reserve is million at december  each basis point change in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in a change in net liability for us of million 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for workers compensation massive injury reserves  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty insurance subsidiaries share of the workers compensation massive injury reserves is million at december  each basis point change in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in a change in net liability for us of million 

table of contents retirement benefit plans our pension plan for employees is the largest and only funded defined benefit plan we offer 
our pension and other retirement benefit obligations are developed from actuarial estimates 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets 
we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience  current market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  and expected future trends 
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments 
we discount those cash payments using the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
in determining the discount rate  we performed a bond matching study 
the study developed a portfolio of non callable bonds rated aa or higher with at least million outstanding at december  these bonds had maturities primarily between zero and twenty six years 
for years beyond year twenty seven  there were no appropriate bonds maturing 
in these instances  the study estimated the appropriate bond by assuming that there would be bonds available with the same characteristics as the available bond maturing in the immediately preceding year 
outlier bonds were excluded from the study 
the cash flows from the bonds were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan  which have a duration of about years 
this bond matching study supported the selection of a discount rate for the pension expense 
the expense was based on a discount rate assumption of 
a change of basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension and other retirement benefit costs in  before consideration of expense allocation to affiliates 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over a year period  which represents the expected remaining service period of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation on the statements of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive income 
these amounts are systematically recognized to future net periodic pension expense in future periods  with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected long term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions  as there are typically not significant changes in the asset mix 
the long term rate of return is derived from expected future returns for each asset category based on applicable indices and their historical relationships under various market conditions 
these expected future returns are then weighed based on our target asset allocation percentages for each asset category 
a reasonably possible change of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension benefit cost before consideration of reimbursement from affiliates 
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market related value of plan assets  which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense 
under this methodology  asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period 
the component of the actuarial gain generated during that related to the actual investment return being different from assumed during the prior year was million 
recognition of this gain will be deferred over a four year period  consistent with the market related asset value methodology 
once factored into the market related asset value  these experience gains will be amortized over a period of years  which is the remaining service period of the employee group 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining our pension and retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents new accounting standards in june  the fasb amended the guidance for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie by requiring a qualitative analysis to determine if an enterprise s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest 
a primary beneficiary is expected to be identified through qualitative analysis  which looks at the power to direct activities of the vie  including its economic performance and the right to receive benefits from the vie that are significant 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years that begin after november  under the current quantitative analysis  although we hold a variable interest in it  we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the exchange  and the exchange s financial statements are not consolidated with ours 
under the new guidance we will be deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the exchange  by virtue of our attorney in fact relationship with the exchange  and consolidation of the exchange in our financial statements will be required effective for our first quarter financial statements 
this will require that the exchange s financial statements  which are currently prepared only in accordance with statutory accounting principles  be prepared in accordance with gaap 
given the materiality of the exchange s operations  consolidating the exchange s financial statements with the company s will materially change our reporting entity s assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  related footnote disclosures and the overall presentation of management s discussion and analysis 
the exchange s equity will be shown as noncontrolling interests in such consolidated statements

our modest rate increases in were offset by exposure reductions and changes in our mix of business which resulted in a slight decrease in our average premium per policy in we continuously evaluate our pricing actions and currently  rate increases are planned for the property and casualty group writes only one year policies 
consequently  rate actions take months to be fully recognized in written premium and months to be recognized fully in earned premiums

service agreement revenue service agreement revenue includes service charges we collect from policyholders for providing extended payment terms on policies written by the property and casualty group and late payment and policy reinstatement fees 
the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment 
service agreement revenue totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
service agreement revenue increased by million in and million in due to the implementation of late payment and policy reinstatement fees that became effective in march these increases were offset somewhat by continued shifts to the no fee  single payment plan driven by a discount in pricing offered for paid in full policies as well as consumers desire to not incur service charges

accelerated rate commissions are offered under specific circumstances to certain newly recruited agencies for their initial three years of operation 
accelerated rate commissions decreased in as existing accelerated commission contracts are expiring 
this is reflective of the fact that although new agency appointments continue  the number of such appointments has been declining 
we appointed new agencies in  in and in agent bonuses agent bonuses are based on an individual agency s property casualty underwriting profitability over a three year period 
there is also a growth component to the bonus  paid only if the agency is profitable

driving the prior accident year development are million of favorable development related to workers compensation reserves offset by adverse development of million related to the pre automobile massive injury reserves 
the favorable workers compensation development was a function of the settlement of several massive injury workers compensation claims  changes to mortality assumptions and a change in the payout patterns used in the calculation to discount workers compensation reserves 
the adverse development on the pre automobile massive injury reserves was the result of changes made to the mortality assumption  specifically the use of gender specific mortality tables  coupled with increasing frequency trends 
adverse development was also experienced on the commercial multi peril line in as a result of some reserve strengthening and the outcome of certain court decisions

the favorable development was due to less than anticipated growth in involuntary reinsurance and  to a lesser extent  reductions in reserve levels related to world trade center wtc losses 
ceded reinsurance ceded reinsurance reserves are primarily related to the pre automobile massive injury claims 
as mentioned in the discussion of direct business above  the pre automobile massive injury reserves increased in due to assumption changes and frequency trends 
these reserve increases drove the corresponding increase in the receivable from the ceded reinsurer 
catastrophe losses catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property casualty insurance business and can have a material impact on our insurance underwriting results 
in addressing this risk  we employ what we believe are reasonable underwriting standards and monitor our exposure by geographic region 
the property and casualty group s definition of catastrophes includes those weather related or other loss events which we consider significant to our geographic footprint which  individually or in the aggregate  may not reach the level of a national catastrophe as defined by the property claim service pcs 
the property and casualty group also maintains property catastrophe reinsurance coverage from unaffiliated insurers 
the property and casualty group maintains sufficient property catastrophe reinsurance coverage from unaffiliated reinsurers and no longer participates in the voluntary assumed reinsurance business  which lowers the variability of the underwriting results of the property and casualty group

we experienced a decline in earnings as a result of asset value reductions recognized in due to adverse market conditions resulting in lower than normal transaction volume and  subsequently  lower sales prices and gains on sales of investments 
limited partnership earnings tend to be cyclical based on market conditions  the age of the partnership and the nature of the investments

for all investment holdings  general economic conditions and or conditions specifically affecting the underlying issuer or its industry  including downgrades by the major rating agencies  are considered in evaluating impairment in value 
other factors considered in our review of investment valuation are the length of time the fair value is below cost and the amount the fair value is below cost 

table of contents we individually analyze all positions with emphasis on those that have  in management s opinion  declined significantly below costs 
with the issuance of new impairment guidance for debt securities in the second quarter of  we further analyze debt securities to determine if a credit related impairment has occurred 
some of the factors considered in determining whether a debt security is credit impaired include potential for the default of interest and or principal  level of subordination  collateral of the issue  compliance with financial covenants  credit ratings and industry conditions 
we have the intent to sell all credit impaired debt securities  therefore the entire amount of the impairment charges are included in earnings and no credit related impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income 
prior to the second quarter of  there was no differentiation between impairments related to credit loss and those related to other factors and declines in fair values of debt securities were deemed other than temporary if we did not have the intent and ability to hold a security to recovery 
for available for sale equity securities  a charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for positions that have experienced other than temporary impairments due to credit quality or other factors 
see investment operations section herein 
if our policy for determining the recognition of impaired positions were different  our consolidated results of operations could be significantly impacted 
management believes its investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of value and recognition of impairment 
fixed maturities under our investment strategy  we maintain a fixed maturities portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector

at december   our investments in limited partnerships represented of total investments  compared to at december  liabilities property casualty loss reserves loss reserves are established to account for the estimated ultimate costs of losses and loss expenses for claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the factors which may potentially cause the greatest variation between current reserve estimates and the actual future paid amounts are unforeseen changes in statutory or case law altering the amounts to be paid on existing claim obligations  new medical procedures and or drugs with costs significantly different from those seen in the past  and claims patterns on current business that differ significantly from historical claims patterns 
loss and loss expense reserves are presented on our consolidated statements of financial position on a gross basis for eic  eny and epc 
our property casualty insurance subsidiaries wrote about of the direct property casualty premiums of the property and casualty group in under the terms of the property and casualty group s quota share and intercompany pooling arrangement  a significant portion of these reserve liabilities are recoverable

the reserves that have the greatest potential for variation are the massive injury claim reserves 
the property and casualty group is currently reserving for about claimants requiring lifetime medical care  of which about involve massive injuries 
the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for the massive injury claimants  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million at december   which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty subsidiaries share of the net massive injury liability reserves was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in the pre automobile massive injury direct and assumed reserves in the above table at december  compared to december  was primarily due to changes impacting the mortality rate assumption in the decrease in the direct and assumed workers compensation massive injury reserve at december   compared to december   was driven by the settlement of several massive injury workers compensation claims  changes to our mortality rate assumption and a change in the discount calculation  which all had the effect of reducing reserves in it is anticipated that these massive injury claims will require payments over the next to years 
in  we changed our medical inflation rate assumption for these reserves to an annual increase grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
in  this assumption was a annual increase grading down after the first year  then grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
the impact on the massive injury liability reserves due to the change in our medical inflation rate assumption in resulted in a reserve reduction of million for the property and casualty group  of which our property casualty subsidiaries share was million 
in  we changed our mortality rate assumption to give weighting to the disabled pensioner mortality table by gender to more appropriately weigh male versus female life expectancies 
in  this assumption gave weighting to our own mortality experience and weighting to the male female combined disabled pensioner mortality table 
the impact on the massive injury liability reserves due to the change in our mortality rate assumption in resulted in a reserve increase of million for the property and casualty group  of which our property casualty subsidiaries share was million

loss reserves are set at full expected cost  except for workers compensation loss reserves  which are discounted on a nontabular basis using an interest rate of based upon the property and casualty group s historical workers compensation payout patterns 
in  the workers compensation massive injury claims that have longer payout patterns were segregated in the discount calculation from the non massive injury workers compensation claims 
the impact on the massive injury liability reserves due to this change resulted in a reserve reduction of million for the property and casualty group  of which our property casualty subsidiaries share was million

the net actuarial loss was primarily due to the actual investment returns being significantly less than expected investment returns  driven by market conditions and a change in the discount rate used to estimate the future benefit obligations to in from in impact of inflation property casualty insurance premiums are established before losses and loss expenses  and therefore  before the extent to which inflation may impact such costs are known 
consequently  in establishing premium rates  we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation  including medical cost inflation  construction and auto repair cost inflation and tort issues 
medical costs are a broad element of inflation that impacts personal and commercial auto  general liability  workers compensation and commercial multi peril lines of insurance written by the property and casualty group 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management operations  the net cash flows of our insurance subsidiaries participation in the underwriting results of the reinsurance pool with the exchange  and investment income from nonaffiliated investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of management operations including salaries and wages and commissions  pension plans  share repurchases  dividends to shareholders and the purchase and development of information technology 
we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations 
when cash provided by operating activities is in excess of our operating cash needs  we may use this excess to fund our investment portfolios or share repurchase activities 
when funding requirements exceed operating cash flows  our investment portfolios may be used as a funding source 
continuing volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash 
some of our fixed income investments  despite being publicly traded  are illiquid due to credit market conditions 
further volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts 
additionally  our limited partnership investments are illiquid 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from other sources even if market volatility persists throughout see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information on the risk of market volatility and item a 
risk factors  for a discussion of certain matters that may affect our investment portfolio and capital position 
management fees from the exchange generate a majority of our operating cash flows 
we have a receivable from the exchange and affiliates related to the management fee receivable from premiums written  but not yet collected  as well as the management fee receivable on premiums collected in the current month 
we pay nearly all general and administrative expenses on behalf of the exchange and other affiliated companies including efl 
the exchange and efl reimburse us for these expenses on a paid basis quarterly 

table of contents we generate cash from our property casualty insurance subsidiaries  which consist of our share of the pooled underwriting results of the property and casualty group 
all members of the property and casualty group pool their underwriting results 
through the pool  our subsidiaries assume of the property and casualty group s underwriting results 
we also generate cash from the income earned on our fixed maturity and equity security investment portfolios and earnings on our limited partnership investments 
management fee and other cash settlements due at december from the exchange were million and million in and  respectively 
a receivable from efl for cash settlements totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the receivable due from the exchange for reinsurance recoverable from unpaid loss and loss expenses and unearned premium balances ceded to the intercompany reinsurance pool increased to million from million at december  and  respectively 
this increase is the result of corresponding increases in direct loss and loss expense reserves of our property casualty insurance subsidiaries that are ceded to the exchange under the intercompany pooling agreement 
the amounts due us from the exchange represented of the exchange s total liabilities at december  and capital outlook if the financial market volatility continues  we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us 
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities  future funding requirements could be met through a million bank line of credit  from which we have no borrowings at december   dividend payments from our wholly owned property casualty insurance subsidiaries  eic  epc and eny  up to their statutory limits totaling million under current regulatory restrictions as of december   our more liquid investments that can be sold  such as our common stock and cash and cash equivalents  which totaled approximately million at december   and the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and our share repurchase activities 
we believe we have the funding sources available to us to support future cash flow requirements in cash flow activities cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in higher operating cash flows in were primarily due to increased management fee revenues received offset by lower distributions from our limited partnerships 
management fee revenues were higher reflecting the increase in the property and casualty group s direct written premium 
limited partnership distributions were lower as a result of a decline in performance of our limited partnership investments in cash paid for agent commissions increased to million in  compared to million in  as a result of an increase in direct written premiums of the property and casualty group and rate increases for certain commercial lines new business premiums 
cash paid for agent bonuses totaled million during compared to million in agent bonuses expected to be paid in  that relate to the period ended in  total million reflecting the impact of the decline in underwriting profitability of the property and casualty group 
we made contributions to our pension plan of million and million in and  respectively 
our policy is to contribute at least the minimum required contribution that is in accordance with the pension protection act of and to fund the annual normal costs of the pension 
for  the expected contribution amount is million  which does exceed the minimum required amount 
our affiliated entities generally reimburse us about of the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plan 
at december   we recorded a gross deferred tax asset of million  which included capital loss carryforwards of million 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized for a portion of the deferred tax asset related to losses on investments 
we have the ability to carry back capital losses of million as a result of gains recognized in prior years 
we have disposed of assets with tax losses of approximately million to carry back against these gains in approximately million of these losses expired in our capital gain and loss strategies take into consideration our ability to offset gains and losses in future periods  further capital loss carry back opportunities to the three preceding years and capital loss carry forward opportunities to apply against future capital gains over the next five years 
cash flows used in our investing activities totaled million in  compared to cash provided of million and million in and  respectively 
our investing operations were impacted by less reinvestments in and due to the significant share repurchase activity in those years 
also impacting our future investing 
table of contents activities are our limited partnership commitments  which at december   totaled million and will be funded as required by the partnerships agreements 
in the second quarter of  we made a capital contribution to efl in the amount of million to support efl s life insurance and annuity business and strengthen its surplus 
cash flows used in financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we reduced our cash outlay for share repurchase activity 
our cost of class a nonvoting common stock repurchased was million in  compared to million in and million in dividends paid to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we increased both our class a and class b shareholder quarterly dividends for there are no regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to our shareholders  although there are state law restrictions on the payment of dividends from our subsidiaries to us 
dividends have been approved at a increase for during  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock at a total cost of million in conjunction with our stock repurchase plan 
we repurchased million shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock at a total cost of million in in may  our board of directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program through june  we have approximately million of repurchase authority remaining under this plan at december  we plan to continue to repurchase shares through this program as cash becomes available for such purpose 
in october  we terminated our securities lending program 
the process of unwinding the securities on loan was complete in december consequently  there were no loaned securities included as part of our invested assets at december  financing activities through december  included short term borrowings of million on our bank line of credit for certain intercompany cash settlement needs 
we made payments on the line of credit of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  reducing the outstanding balance to zero at december  this line of credit was extended to december  there were no borrowings on this line as of december  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants  which include minimum net worth and leverage ratios 
we are in compliance with all covenants at december  also during the first quarter of  we borrowed million from eic  our owned property casualty insurance subsidiary  to fund certain operating and financing activities 
we repaid the entire balance during the second quarter of this intercompany borrowing was eliminated upon consolidation and therefore had no impact on our consolidated statements of financial position or operations 
contractual obligations cash outflows are variable because the fluctuations in settlement dates for claims payments vary and cannot be predicted with absolute certainty 
while volatility in claims payments could be significant for the property and casualty group  the effect of this volatility on our performance is mitigated by the intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangement and our participation 
the cash flow requirements for claims have not historically had a significant effect on our liquidity 
based on a historical year average  about of losses and loss expenses included in the reserve are paid out in the subsequent month period and approximately are paid out within a five year period 
losses that are paid out after that five year period reflect such long tail lines as workers compensation and auto bodily injury 
such payments are reduced by recoveries under the intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 

table of contents we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various contracts 
as of december   the aggregate obligations were as follows payments due by period and in thousands total thereafter fixed obligations limited partnership commitments pension contribution other commitments operating leases vehicles operating leases real estate operating leases computers financing arrangements fixed contractual obligations gross loss and loss expense reserves gross contractual obligations gross contractual obligations net of estimated reinsurance recoverables and reimbursements from affiliates are as follows payments due by period and in thousands total thereafter gross contractual obligations estimated reinsurance recoverables estimated reimbursements from affiliates net contractual obligations limited partnership commitments will be funded as required for capital contributions at any time prior to the agreement expiration date

we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations and from positive cash flows generated from existing limited partnership investments to meet these partnership commitments 
the pension contribution for was estimated in accordance with the pension protection act of contributions anticipated in future years are expected to be an amount at least equal to the irs minimum required contribution in accordance with this act 
other commitments include various agreements for service  including such things as computer software  telephones and maintenance 
operating leases real estate are for of our field offices that are operated in the states in which the property and casualty group does business and three operating leases are for warehousing facilities and remote office locations 
one of the branch locations is leased from efl 
gross contractual obligations do not include the obligations for our unfunded benefit plans  including the supplemental employee retirement plan serp for our executive and senior management and the directors retirement plan 
the recorded accumulated benefit obligations for these plans at december   are million 
we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the future benefit payments as they become due 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include those with unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations  including material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that conduct certain activities 
there are no off balance sheet obligations related to our variable interest in the exchange

we have no material off balance sheet obligations or guarantees  other than the limited partnership investment commitments 

table of contents financial ratings our property casualty insurers are rated by rating agencies that provide insurance consumers with meaningful information on the financial strength of insurance entities 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors 
the insurers of the erie insurance group are currently rated by am best company as follows erie insurance exchange a erie insurance company a erie insurance property and casualty company a erie insurance company of new york a flagship city insurance a erie family life insurance a the outlook for all ratings is stable 
according to am best  a superior rating a is assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best and have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over the long term 
by virtue of its affiliation with the property and casualty group  efl is typically rated one notch lower than the property casualty companies by am best company 
the insurers of the property and casualty group are also rated by standard poor s  but this rating is based solely on public information 
standard poor s rates the property casualty insurers aapi  very strong  and efl api  strong 
financial strength ratings continue to be an important factor in evaluating the competitive position of insurance companies 
regulatory risk based capital the standard set by the national association of insurance commissioners naic for measuring the solvency of insurance companies  referred to as risk based capital rbc  is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
at december   the companies comprising the property and casualty group all had rbc levels substantially in excess of levels that would require regulatory action 
transactions and agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors board has broad oversight responsibility over intercompany relationships within erie insurance group 
as a consequence  the board may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders such as setting the management fee rate paid by the exchange to us  determining the continuation and participation percentages of the intercompany pooling agreement  determining the level of shareholders dividend  if any  and ratifying any other significant intercompany activity 
subscriber s agreement we serve as attorney in fact for the exchange  a reciprocal insurance exchange 
each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber s agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney in fact 
through the designation of attorney in fact  we are required to provide sales  underwriting and policy issuance services to the policyholders of the exchange  as discussed previously 

table of contents intercompany agreements pooling members of the property and casualty group participate in an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
under the pooling agreement  all insurance business of the property and casualty group is pooled in the exchange 
the erie insurance company and erie insurance company of new york share in the underwriting results of the reinsurance pool through retrocession 
since  the board of directors has set the allocation of the pooled underwriting results at participation for erie insurance company  participation for erie insurance company of new york and participation for the exchange 
service agreements we make certain payments for the account of the group s related entities 
these amounts are reimbursed to us on a cost basis in accordance with the service agreements 
cash transfers are settled quarterly 
leased property the exchange leases certain office facilities to us on a year to year basis 
rents are determined considering returns on invested capital and building operating and overhead costs 
rental costs of shared facilities are allocated based on square footage occupied 
intercompany cost allocation the allocation of costs affects the financial condition of the erie insurance group companies 
management must determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with intercompany management service agreements  the attorney in fact agreements with the policyholders of the exchange and applicable insurance laws and regulations 
while allocation of costs under these various agreements requires management judgment and interpretation  such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology  which in management s opinion  adheres to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements 
intercompany receivables percent of total percent of total company company in thousands assets assets reinsurance recoverable from and ceded unearned premiums to the exchange other receivables from the exchange and affiliates management fees  costs and reimbursements note receivable from efl total intercompany receivables we have significant receivables from the exchange that result in a concentration of credit risk 
these receivables include the liability for losses and unearned premiums ceded to the exchange under the intercompany pooling agreement and from management services performed by us for the exchange 
the policyholder surplus of the exchange at december   on a statutory accounting basis totaled over billion 
credit risks related to the receivables from the exchange are evaluated periodically by our management 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders if the exchange were unable to satisfy its obligation 
we collect our reinsurance recoverable amount generally within days of actual settlement of losses 
we also have a receivable from the exchange for management fees and costs we pay on behalf of the exchange 
we also pay certain costs for  and are reimbursed by  efl 
since our inception  we have collected these amounts due from the exchange and efl in a timely manner normally quarterly 
there is interest charged on the outstanding balance due from the exchange until its quarterly settlement that is based on an independent mutual fund rate 
we have a surplus note for million with efl that is payable on demand on or after december   subject to prior approval by the pennsylvania department of insurance 
efl paid interest to us on the surplus note totaling million in both and no other interest is charged or received on these intercompany balances due to the timely settlement terms and nature of the items 

table of contents factors that may affect future results financial condition of the exchange we have a direct interest in the financial condition of the exchange because management fee revenues are based on the direct written premiums of the exchange and the other members of the property and casualty group 
additionally  we participate in the underwriting results of the exchange through the pooling arrangement in which our insurance subsidiaries have participation 
a concentration of credit risk exists related to the unsecured receivables due from the exchange for certain fees  costs and reimbursements 
to the extent that the exchange incurs underwriting losses or investment losses resulting from declines in the value of its marketable securities or limited partnership investments  the exchange s policyholders surplus would be adversely affected 
if the surplus of the exchange were to decline significantly from its current level  the property and casualty group could find it more difficult to retain its existing business and attract new business 
a decline in the business of the property and casualty group would have an adverse effect on the amount of the management fees we receive and the underwriting results of the property and casualty group 
in addition  a significant decline in the surplus of the exchange from its current level would make it more likely that the management fee rate would be reduced 
a decline in surplus could also result from variability in investment markets as realized and unrealized losses are recognized 
due to the continued distress in the securities and real estate markets  the exchange recognized impairment charges in of million 
to the extent market volatility continues  the exchange s investment portfolio may continue to be impacted 
additionally  conditions may exist where the exchange may need to provide capital support to efl 
in the second quarter of  the exchange made a capital contribution to efl in the amount of million to support efl s life insurance and annuity business and strengthen its surplus 
at december   the exchange had billion in statutory surplus and a premium to surplus ratio of less than to the exchange has strong underlying operating cash flows and sufficient liquidity to meet its needs  including the ability to pay the management fees owed to us 
in  the exchange generated million in cash flows from operating activities 
at december  the exchange had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the exchange also has an unused million bank line of credit that expires on september  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants which include minimum collateral values 
the exchange was in compliance with all bank covenants at december  insurance premium rate actions the changes in premiums written attributable to rate changes of the property and casualty group directly affect the direct written premium levels and underwriting profitability of the property and casualty group  the exchange and us  and have a direct bearing on our management fees 
pricing actions contemplated or taken by the property and casualty group are also subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which these insurers operate 
the pricing actions already implemented  or to be implemented through  will also have an effect on the market competitiveness of the property and casualty group s insurance products 
such pricing actions  and those of competitors  could affect the ability of our agents to sell and or renew business 
we expect our pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in  however  recessionary economic conditions could continue to adversely impact the average premium per policy written by the property and casualty group 
policy growth premium levels attributable to growth in policies in force of the property and casualty group directly affect the profitability of our management operations 
our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of our pricing segmentation model has contributed to our growth in new policies in force and improved retention ratios 
the continued growth of the policy base of the property and casualty group is dependent upon the property and casualty group s ability to retain existing and attract new policyholders 
a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the growth of premium levels for the property and casualty group  and  consequently  our management fees 
catastrophe losses the property and casualty group conducts business in states and the district of columbia  primarily in the mid atlantic  mid western and southeastern portions of the united states 
a substantial portion of the business is private passenger and commercial automobile  homeowners and workers compensation insurance in ohio  maryland  virginia and  particularly  pennsylvania 
as a result  catastrophic events  destructive weather patterns  or changes in climate condition could materially adversely affect the results of operations and surplus position of the members of the property and casualty group 
common catastrophe events include severe winter storms  hurricanes  earthquakes  
table of contents tornadoes  wind and hail storms 
in its homeowners line of insurance  the property and casualty group is particularly exposed to an atlantic hurricane  which might strike the states of north carolina  maryland  virginia and pennsylvania 
the property and casualty group maintains a property catastrophe reinsurance treaty with nonaffiliated reinsurers to mitigate the future potential catastrophe loss exposure 
the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage in provided coverage of up to of a loss of million in excess of the property and casualty group s loss retention of million per occurrence 
this agreement was renewed for providing coverage of up to of a loss of million in excess of the property and casualty group s loss retention of million per occurrence 
while the property and casualty group is exposed to terrorism losses in commercial lines  including workers compensation  these lines are afforded a limited backstop above insurer deductibles for foreign acts of terrorism under the federal terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization and extension act of that continues through december  the property and casualty group has no personal lines terrorism coverage in place 
although current models suggest the most likely occurrences would not have a material impact on the property and casualty group  there is a chance that if future terrorism attacks occur  the property and casualty group could incur large losses 
incurred but not reported ibnr losses the property and casualty group is exposed to new claims on previously closed files and to larger than historical settlements on pending and unreported claims 
we are exposed to increased losses by virtue of our participation in the intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement with the exchange 
we exercise professional diligence to establish reserves at the end of each period that are fully reflective of the ultimate value of all claims incurred 
however  these reserves are  by their nature  only estimates and cannot be established with absolute certainty 
the reserves that have the greatest potential for variation are the massive injury reserves 
the workers compensation product and the automobile no fault law in pennsylvania from until provided for unlimited medical benefits 
the estimation of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health and mortality over time 
actual experience has the potential to be impacted by changes in laws as well as costs  such as attendant care  inflation rates and mortality 
actual experience  different than that assumed  could have a significant impact on the reserve estimates 
market volatility our portfolio of fixed income  limited partnerships  preferred and common stocks are subject to significant market value changes especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets 
uncertainty remains surrounding the general market conditions 
the current volatility in the financial markets could have an adverse impact on our financial condition  operations and cash flows 
as of january   all changes to unrealized gains and losses on the common stock portfolio are recognized in investment income as net realized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the common stock portfolio is subject to fluctuation from period to period resulting from changes in prices 
depending upon market conditions  this could cause considerable fluctuation in reported total investment income 
financial conditions financial markets have been experiencing an improvement in recent months although overall economic conditions remain challenging 
unfavorable changes in economic conditions  including declining consumer confidence  inflation  recession or other changes  may lead the property and casualty group s customers to cancel insurance policies  modify coverage or not renew policies  and the group s premium revenue  and consequently our management fee  could be adversely affected 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of the group s customers to pay premiums as they fall due  and as a result  the group s reserves and write offs could increase 
the group is unable to predict the uncertainty in financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and abroad

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures  including interest rate risk  equity price risk and credit risk  and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  interest rate risk we invest primarily in fixed maturity investments  which comprised of invested assets at december  the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
we do not hedge our exposure to interest rate risk since we have the capacity and intention to hold the fixed maturity positions until maturity 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
these factors are analyzed monthly to ensure that both the duration and convexity remain in the targeted ranges we established 
a sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible changes in those rates 
the following pro forma information is presented assuming a basis point increase in interest rates at december of each year and reflects the estimated effect on the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio

we do not hedge our exposure to equity price risk inherent in our equity investments 
our objective is to earn competitive relative returns by investing in a diverse portfolio of high quality  liquid securities 
portfolio holdings are diversified across industries and among exchange traded small to large cap stocks 
we measure risk by comparing the performance of the marketable equity portfolio to benchmark returns such as the standard poors s p composite index 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for our common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
credit risk our objective is to earn competitive returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of securities 
our portfolios of fixed maturity securities  nonredeemable preferred stock  mortgage loans and  to a lesser extent  short term investments are subject to credit risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the borrower s ability to repay the debt 
we manage this risk by performing upfront underwriting analysis and ongoing reviews of credit quality by position and for the fixed maturity portfolio in total 
we do not hedge the credit risk inherent in our fixed maturity investments 
generally  the fixed maturities in our portfolio are rated by external rating agencies 
if not externally rated  we rate them internally on a basis consistent with that used by the rating agencies 
we classify all fixed maturities as available for sale securities  allowing us to meet our liquidity needs and provide greater flexibility to appropriately respond to changes in market conditions

we believe we have no direct exposure to the subprime residential mortgage market through investments in structured products
