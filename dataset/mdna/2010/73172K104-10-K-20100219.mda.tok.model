overview we are a leading provider of high quality  easy to use unified communications uc solutions that enable enterprise  government  education  and healthcare customers to collaborate more effectively 
our solutions are built on architectures that enable unified video  voice  and content collaboration 
polycom uses open standards and removes distance and organizational barriers to enable dispersed work teams to easily meet and collaborate via the video or voice communications devices they choose  bringing people together efficiently and increasing productivity 
our business operates in three segments video communications solutions  voice communications solutions  and services 
our video communications solutions segment is comprised of video communications products such as telepresence  room  desktop  and personal video conferencing products and network systems products such as uc media servers  network management  security  streaming  and recording solutions 
our voice communications solutions segment includes our conference phone products  wired desktop voice products  and wireless handset voice products 
our services segment encompasses maintenance contracts for our products  as well as a wide range of professional service and support offerings for our customers  channels  and strategic partners 
in  video communications solutions  along with its attached services comprised of polycom revenues and voice communications solutions  along with its attached services  comprised the remaining of revenues 

table of contents important drivers for the adoption of polycom uc solutions include the return on investment roi achieved through productivity gains of faster decision making and the reduction in travel costs  the significant improvement in quality of customer experience through our immersive telepresence and high definition video and voice solutions  the ease of connectivity through business to business and emerging cloud based solutions  and the environmental or green benefits of using polycom s solutions 
based on these drivers and polycom s increasingly unique position as a large collaboration independent solutions provider  we launched a strategic investment plan to capture a strong position in the growing uc collaboration market 
we believe polycom has the opportunity to serve a pivotal role in the broader communications ecosystem to provide an integrated collaboration solution  regardless of which call management or presence based solution a particular customer has adopted 
to best capitalize on these factors  we announced a strategic investment plan in the fourth quarter of we are now executing on five core strategic initiatives to capture the collaboration market opportunity and to optimize our position as the partner of choice for global communications providers and as the provider of choice for our customers 
these initiatives include enhancements to our go to market capability  building our strategic partnerships with companies such as avaya  broadsoft  hewlett packard  ibm  juniper  microsoft and siemens  focusing on service providers enhanced sell through  as well as specific products and services to support their growing offerings in the managed and hosted space  further innovation surrounding our telepresence solutions  and expansion of our professional services practice 
revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or  over the decrease in revenues primarily reflects a significant decrease in the sales volumes of our voice communications solutions products and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in sales of our video communication products  partially offset by increases in network systems product sales and increases in service revenues 
we believe that the overall decrease in revenues is primarily due to the global economic climate  which has resulted in longer sales cycles and delays in new equipment purchases  particularly in our voice communications solutions segment 
although we believe our video communications solutions products are better able to sustain the impact of current economic conditions as they offer a rapid return on investment  tightened corporate budgets and reduced capital expenditures in also negatively impacted our video communications solutions product revenues 
our video communications solutions segment  which accounted for of our revenues in  decreased by compared to  while our voice communication solutions segment  which accounted for of our revenues in  decreased by compared to our services segment revenues  which accounted for of our revenues in  increased by compared to geographically  revenues decreased by   and in north america  emea europe  middle east and africa and latin america  respectively  in over  while asia pacific revenues increased by in over see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin  segment inventory and revenue by geography 
while our revenues decreased year over year across many of our product lines and geographies  our business improved sequentially across all product lines and geographies and returned to overall year over year growth in the fourth quarter of despite these recent signs of stabilization  we continue to be cautious about our future outlook in light of the global economic climate 
gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to due primarily to lower sales volumes of our video communications solutions and voice communications products and a shift in product mix toward lower margin products 
this was partially offset by higher gross margins on our network systems products and increased margins on our services segment revenues 
however  the increase in our service segment revenues as a percentage of total revenues contributed to the overall decrease in gross margins in as compared to  as service gross margins are lower than our product gross margins 

table of contents operating margins decreased in over primarily as a result of lower gross margins and operating expenses increasing as a percentage of revenues 
while operating expenses decreased in absolute dollars by in as compared to  revenues decreased by during the same period 
we took actions  including certain restructuring actions  to realign and reinvest resources in the strategic growth areas of the business 
further  in order to control operating expenses in  we took actions to reduce costs such as delaying or limiting the scope of engineering and marketing programs and other projects  imposing travel restrictions  postponed salary increases  requested employees to use paid time off or implemented other cost control measures 
these actions are not necessarily sustainable in the long term and we will need to increase spending in order to maintain and build the business in future periods  which among other factors may negatively impact our operating margins  particularly the reinstatement of merit increases  which is currently planned for the third quarter of and bonus programs  which we currently plan to phase in commencing in the second quarter of  and the elimination of encouraged paid time off programs 
in  we also plan to significantly increase our spending levels in sales and marketing and  to a lesser extent  research and development and general and administrative areas  as part of our strategic investment plan 
this increased investment level will lower profits in the short term  but is designed to yield increased growth in both our revenues and profitability in the future 
during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities which  after the impact of investing  share repurchases and other financing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net increase in our total cash and cash equivalents

table of contents video communications solutions segment revenues include revenues from sales of our video communications and network systems product lines 
revenue from video communications products decreased to million in from million in  an decrease 
the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes of our vsx product family  and to a lesser extent lower sales revenues of our rpx immersive telepresence products  partially offset by increases in sales volumes of our hdx product family and new products  such as our polycom cx and qdx video communications solutions 
revenues from our network systems products for were million  an increase of compared to revenues of million  due primarily to increases in our video network systems and software revenues  which were driven primarily by the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
voice communications solutions segment revenues decreased over to million  due primarily to lower sales volumes of voice communications products  including our circuit switched  wireless  voice over ip conference phones and installed voice product lines 
revenues from our voice communications solutions have declined year over year since the fourth quarter of we believe these declines are primarily a result of the global economic climate and that this business will improve as the economy improves 
in the third quarter of we experienced sequential growth for the first time since the second quarter of  with voice communication revenues growing over the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  voice communication revenues continued to show sequential growth  growing over the third quarter of  resulting in a year over year decline for the quarter of only compared to the double digit year over year declines of to experienced in the first three quarters of services segment revenues increased to million by million  or due primarily to increases in video related services and  to a lesser extent  increased network systems related services  partially offset by a decrease in voice related services 
total revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over in  excluding the impact of the spectralink acquisition on growth rates  we experienced slower growth than in  particularly in our voice communication product lines due in part to the global economic conditions  as well as increased competition 
the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our video communications solutions and voice communications solutions products and  to a lesser extent  an increase in service revenues 
revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for approximately million of the year over year increase and are included in the voice communications solutions and services segments 
revenue from video communications products increased to million in from million in  an increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families 
revenues from our network systems products for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues of million  due primarily to decreases in our voice network systems revenues  which was only partially offset by increases in revenues from our video network systems products 
voice communications solutions product revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in revenues from our voice over ip products  as well as a full year of revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition during the last week of the first quarter of services segment revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in revenues from our video communications products  increases in revenues related to products acquired in the spectralink acquisition and  to a lesser extent  increases in video network systems services 
international sales  which are defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
on a regional basis  north america  emea  asia pacific and latin america accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
north america  emea and latin america revenues decreased   and  respectively  in over  while asia pacific revenues increased in over revenue decreases across these geographic regions were primarily in the voice communications solutions segment and video communications products  partially offset by increases in video network systems products and service segment revenues 
although asia pacific also experienced declines in revenue from the voice communications solutions segment  revenues from video communications products were essentially flat year over year  and the declines in voice communications 
table of contents solutions segment revenues were more than offset by growth in video network systems products and service revenues year over year 
on a regional basis  north america  emea  asia pacific and latin america accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
north america  emea  asia pacific and latin america revenues increased   and  respectively  in over revenues in north america  emea  asia pacific and latin america increased in over as a result of an increase in video communications and voice communication product revenues and increased services revenues 
in  we experienced slower growth than in  particularly in north america due in part to the global economic conditions  as well as increased competition 
in  one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues and our video communications solutions and voice communication solutions segment revenues 
no one channel partner accounted for more than of our service segment revenues 
in  one channel partner accounted for more than of our video communications solutions segment revenues 
no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our voice communications solutions or services segment revenues in in  no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our video communications solutions  voice communications solutions or services segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and  therefore  we do not consider backlog to be a good indicator of future revenues 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and for which we expect to record revenue in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue until earned 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate primarily as a result of the level and timing of orders received and customer delivery dates requested outside of the quarter 
the level of backlog at any given time is also dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based in part on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders  which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline from its current levels

table of contents cost of product revenues and product gross margins cost of product revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments  amortization and impairment of certain intangible assets  stock based compensation costs and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  video communications solutions segment products have a higher gross margin than products in our voice communications solutions segment 
cost of product revenues and product gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to due to decreases in gross margins in both our video communications solutions and voice communications solutions segments 
the decrease in video communications solutions segment gross margins was primarily due to lower gross margins on our video communications products due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin products  and lower sales volumes of our video communications products 
this was partially offset by higher gross margins on our network systems products 
the decrease in the voice communication solutions segment gross margins was due primarily to lower sales volumes  particularly in our wireless and circuit switched product lines  and a mix shift toward lower margin products  such as our voice over ip handsets 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to which is due in part to an increase in the amortization of core and existing technology purchased intangibles as a result of the spectralink acquisition that we completed at the end of the first quarter of and to a shift in product mix toward lower margin voice over ip  hdx and rpx products and away from higher margin network systems products  which was partially offset by a decrease in the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for the write up of certain inventory to its fair value at the time of the spectralink acquisition  which resulted in higher product costs being recorded for certain inventory sold in the first half of excluding costs which are not allocated to our segments  such as amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value adjustments to inventory related to acquisition accounting  gross margins decreased slightly in our video communications solutions and voice communications solutions segments in compared to the fluctuation in these segments gross margin was primarily due to changes in product mix 
video communications solutions gross margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues from our voice network systems products  which typically have higher gross margins than our video communications products 
the lower video communications solutions gross margin was also due to lower video communications product gross margins attributable in part to new video product offerings  which typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction due to higher component costs  the technological complexity of the newer products and lower initial production volumes 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were lower than the december  levels primarily due to a lower planned build as a result of lower revenues 
inventory turns have improved in as compared to inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  including the differences in planned versus actual sales mix  an increase in the inventory purchases transported via ocean freight versus air freight and other factors and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
we expect product gross margins to remain relatively flat in the near term  but margins could be higher or lower depending on mix variations and other factors 
forecasting future product gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased price variances  
table of contents warranty and recall costs and timing of sales can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall  service gross margins increased in over primarily as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than the related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
in addition  the increase in our service segment revenues as a percentage of total revenues contributed to the overall decrease in gross margins in as compared to  as service gross margins are lower than our product gross margins 
overall  service gross margins increased in over primarily as a result of increased video related maintenance services where we benefited from economies of scale  as well as achieving greater efficiencies in our product installation and implementation services 
forecasting future service gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future pricing and or potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related attach rates for new service as well as maintenance renewal rates  the utilization of our professional services personnel as we develop our professional services practice and we make investments to expand our professional services offerings as part of our recently announced strategic investment plan  our ability to achieve greater efficiencies in the installations of our rpx telepresence product  increasing costs for freight and repair costs  and the timing of sales can cause our cost of services revenues percentage to vary from quarter to quarter 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues

sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of increases in our sales and marketing headcount as well as increases in revenue  and to a lesser extent  increases in marketing programs 
sales and marketing headcount increased from december  to december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the significant investments we made in our sales team and the time required for new sales personnel to achieve optimal sales productivity levels 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as a result of incurring costs to recruit and hire new sales and marketing personnel  and expenses will also likely increase in the future as revenues increase 
we will also make additional investments in sales and marketing as a result of our strategic investment plan to support our key initiatives surrounding enhancing our go to market capability  increasing our strategic partnerships and focusing on service providers enhanced sell through  as well as specific products and services to support their growing offerings in the managed and hosted space  in order to extend our market reach and grow our business 
forecasting sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products and also depending upon the timing of trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to control operating expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as delaying or limiting the scope of marketing programs and other projects  imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures

in addition  an increasing percentage of our research and development is being performed in lower cost jurisdictions 
we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our collaboration communications solutions  which encompass products and services in all three segments  including enhancements to our existing network systems products  products that address the high definition video conferencing market  including our immersive telepresence products  and additional voice over ip products 
we also anticipate committing a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward enhancing the integration and interoperability of our entire video communications product suite 
we are also currently planning to invest more heavily in research and development as a result of increased business opportunities with strategic partners and service provider customers as a result of our key strategic initiatives in these areas  as well as in key vertical markets such as the us federal government 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities in any given quarter 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter

general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars and remained flat as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to the decrease in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative was primarily due to decreased compensation charges  reductions in outside services and travel and training costs and reduced bad debt expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to the decrease in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to decreased stock based compensation charges and legal and outside services  partially offset by increased bad debt expense and compensation charges related to increased headcount  as well as increased facilities and information technology costs 
significant future charges due to costs associated with litigation or uncollectibility of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the near term but could fluctuate as we make investments in enhancements to our financial and operating systems and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and our continued investments in international regions 
general and administrative expenses will also increase as a result of additional investments required to support our key strategic initiatives  including adding additional infrastructure to support our increased go to market capability and focus on service providers

acquisition related integration costs we recorded charges to operations of million in and million in for acquisition related integration costs 
there were no such charges during these charges primarily include outside financial advisory  accounting  legal and consulting fees and other costs directly related to integrating acquired companies 
the and charges primarily related to professional services costs to integrate spectralink  which we acquired in march  and to a lesser extent destiny  which we acquired in january if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to those transactions 
purchased in process research and development in  we recorded charges totaling million for in process research and development acquired as part of our acquisition of spectralink 
there were no such charges in or the research and development acquired as part of the spectralink acquisition related primarily to projects associated with enhancements and upgrades to the functionality and performance of the spectralink  spectralink and dect products 

table of contents the amount allocated to purchased in process research and development was determined by management after considering  among other factors  established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects as of the acquisition date 
all significant in process research and development projects had been completed as of december  amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  for amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in  and  we recorded amortization totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to eight years 
in  million of the total operating expense related to the impairment of certain intangibles that we acquired in the voyant acquisition 
there was no impairment in or the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to lower amortization as a result of certain intangibles acquired in the voyant and dstmedia acquisitions becoming fully amoritized at the end of the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the voyant acquisition due to their impairment in the fourth quarter of we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of the impairment assessment  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of the year end  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from future products that will utilize the technology acquired in the acquisition 
at december   the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million 
restructure costs in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
in  these actions were designed to reduce our cost structure while maintaining flexibility to invest in the strategic growth areas of the business 
we expect to record additional charges of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result of the final notifications related to these actions 
in  these actions were intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in  these actions primarily related to the reorganization of our video and network systems divisions into one combined business unit  the video communications solutions group  and the elimination of certain executive positions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructure costs 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of 
table of contents employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
litigation reserves and payments during  we recorded a reserve totaling million related to an ongoing legal matter 
during  we recorded charges totaling million as a result of trial preparation costs and the fee arrangement we had with our outside legal counsel that represented us in our litigation against codian  pursuant to which we owed additional legal fees based upon the favorable outcome that was achieved in the first quarter of there were no such expenses in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and could result in charges that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts  gains and losses on investments  non income related taxes and fees and foreign exchange related gains and losses 
interest and other income expense  was a net expense of million in and a net income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest and other income expense  net  decreased in over primarily due to lower interest income and lower average investment returns  partially offset by lower foreign exchange related losses  a decrease in non income related taxes and license fees and losses recorded in related to investments which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
there were no such impairment losses during interest income decreased for over the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to lower average investment returns 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were for compared to for interest and other income expense  net  decreased in over primarily due to lower interest income and foreign exchange related losses compared to foreign exchange related gains in the same period of the prior year  partially offset by increased non income related taxes and license fees and losses recorded in related to investments which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
there were no such impairment losses during interest income decreased for over the comparable period in the prior year primarily lower average cash and investment balances due to our stock repurchase activity in and lower average investment returns 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were for compared to in interest and other income expense  net will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and returns on our cash and investments  any future impairment of investments  foreign currency rate fluctuations on un hedged exposures  fluctuations in costs associated with our hedging program and timing of non income related taxes and license fees 
the cash balance could also decrease depending upon the amount of cash used in any future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors  which would also impact our interest income 
gain loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when 
table of contents events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in  our investments were permanently written down by million from original cost  which is reflected in gain loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the write down of million in the second quarter of was based upon our evaluation of the investee s financial position  including cash usage  the status of the investee s business prospects as of june   and the rights and privileges associated with the investment 
based on this evaluation and our intent as of june  not to participate in the round of additional funding of the investee that was in process at the time  it was determined that based upon the preferences  including liquidation preferences  that would be held by more senior securities  the write down of the carrying value to zero was necessary 
no such write downs were required in either or provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily related to lower releases of tax reserves and related interest and penalties in of million as compared to when we released million in tax reserves and related interest and penalties  all due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in both the u 
s and various foreign jurisdictions 
partially offsetting the effect of the change in the release of the tax reserves was a relative increase in foreign earnings in which are subject to lower tax rates 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  combined with the settlement of certain audits with foreign tax authorities  substantially offset by the non deductibility of the in process research and development acquired in the spectralink acquisition 
as of december   we had approximately million in tax net operating and capital loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryovers  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
in addition  at december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to net operating loss carryforwards in denmark 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to stockholders equity in the amount of million and million would be an adjustment to tax expense 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 

table of contents we are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities  and in some cases  we have received additional tax assessments 
currently  certain tax years are under audit by the relevant tax authorities  including an examination of our us federal tax returns for the calendar years and by the irs which is currently underway 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
while it is reasonably possible that some issues in the irs examination could be resolved within the next months  based on the current facts and circumstances  we cannot estimate the timing of such resolution or the range of potential changes as it relates to the unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as part of our financial statements  as the outcome of such examinations is inherently uncertain 
segment information a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales  direct marketing and direct engineering expenses 
management allocates corporate manufacturing costs and some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include sales costs  marketing costs other than direct marketing  stock based compensation costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets  purchase accounting adjustments made to inventory  purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring costs  interest and other income expense  net 
video communications solutions year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of video communications solutions revenues pts pts video communications solutions segment revenues include revenues from sales of our video communication products and network systems product lines 
revenues from our video communications solutions segment decreased by million  or  over to million in revenue from video communications products  which consisted primarily of our hdx and vsx product families  decreased by to million for from million in  primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes as a result of the global economic climate 
sales of our rpx and tpx telepresence solutions were also lower in as compared to with the increasing adoption of hd in  our hd products comprised an increasing percentage of the group video units sold 
for  approximately of our video communication product revenues were derived from our high definition hdx products versus our standard definition vsx products 
we believe the return on investment of video may make this segment of our business more resilient than our voice communications solutions segment in the current economic environment  however  in we experienced  and may continue to experience  a negative impact on our video communications product revenues due to tightened capital and operating budgets given the current economic environment 
revenues from our network systems products for were million  an increase 
table of contents of compared to revenues of million  due primarily to increases in our video network systems and software revenues  offsetting decreases in voice network systems revenues 
total unit sales of our video network systems products increased in as compared to  and we continued to see a mix shift toward our newer rmx product lines away from our mgc products  with rmx units comprising the majority of video network systems units shipped during growth in our software revenues primarily reflects increased revenues from sales of our polycom converged management application cma desktop software application products 
voice network systems product revenues declined in compared to and were essentially zero in the second half of as a result of the increased adoption of our unified rmx product offering 
revenues from our video communications solutions segment increased by million or over to million in revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million in  an increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products 
with the increasing adoption of hd throughout  our hdx products comprised an increasing percentage of the group video units sold and contributed to higher average selling prices 
in the fourth quarter of  approximately of our video communications product revenues were derived from our high definition hdx products versus our standard definition vsx products 
revenues also increased as a result of increased revenues from sales of our rpx and tpx telepresence products 
the return on investment of video may be helping drive growth in our video communications solutions segment  which may make this segment of our business more resilient in the economic environment 
revenues from our network systems products for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues of million  due primarily to decreases in our voice network systems product revenues  which was only partially offset by increases in revenues from our video network systems products

in and one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues for our video communications solutions segment 
in  no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues for our video communications solutions segment 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a long term material adverse effect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
the contribution margin as a percentage of video communications solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in contribution margins decreased primarily as a result of lower gross margins in our video communications product lines  which were partially offset by higher gross margins in our network systems product lines 
the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin products and lower sales volumes of our video communications products 
engineering expenses decreased in absolute dollars and slightly as a percentage of revenues 
direct marketing expenses remained relatively flat in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues 
the contribution margin as a percentage of video communications solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in contribution margins increased primarily as a result of engineering expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues and in absolute dollars  partially offset by slightly lower gross margins and increased direct marketing expenses 
gross margins decreased primarily due to changes in product mix 
video communications solutions gross margins were negatively impacted by the year over year decrease in revenues from our voice network systems products  which typically have higher gross margins than our video communications products 
direct marketing and engineering spending in the video communications solutions segment will fluctuate depending upon the timing of new product launches and marketing programs 

table of contents voice communications solutions year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of voice communications solutions revenues pts revenues from our voice communications solutions segment for decreased over to million  due primarily to lower sales volumes of voice communications products  including our circuit switched  wireless  voice over ip conference phones and installed voice product lines 
our voice communications solutions segment revenues are dependent on our partners rollouts of ip call management systems and system expansions  and in the current economic climate  product sales in this segment continued to slow in as compared to revenues from our voice communications solutions have declined year over year since the fourth quarter of we believe these declines are primarily a result of the global economic climate and that this business will improve as the economy improves 
in the third quarter of we experienced sequential growth for the first time since the second quarter of  with voice communication revenues growing over the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  voice communication revenues continued to show sequential growth  growing over the third quarter of  resulting in a year over year decline of only compared to the double digit year over year declines of to experienced in the first three quarters of we believe these improved results in the second half of are due in part to improvements in the economy 
revenues from our voice communications solutions segment for increased over to million  due primarily to increases in sales volumes of our voice over ip and installed voice products  as well as a full year of revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition during the first quarter of revenues from products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for approximately of the increase in revenues in this segment 
this was partially offset by year over year decreases in revenues from our circuit switch products 
in  excluding the impact of the spectralink acquisition on growth rates  we experienced slower growth than in in our voice product lines due in part to the global economic conditions 
international revenues  defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of our total voice communications solutions segment revenues for  and  respectively 
in  one customer accounted for more than of our voice communications solutions segment revenues

we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a long term material adverse effect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
the contribution margin as a percentage of voice communications segment revenues was in compared to in  a decrease of percentage points 
the contribution margin decreased primarily due to lower gross margins and  to a lesser extent  higher engineering and direct marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
gross margins decreased primarily as a result of lower sales volumes  particularly in our wireless and circuit switched product lines  and a shift in product mix toward lower margin products  such as our voice over ip handsets 
engineering and direct marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars but increased as a percent of revenues due to the lower revenues in as compared to the contribution margin as a percentage of voice communications segment revenues was in and the contribution margin remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins partially offset by engineering 
table of contents expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues although increasing in absolute dollars 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the higher mix of voice over ip handset and wireless product revenues which generally have a lower gross margin than our circuit switched and installed voice products 
engineering expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of the spectralink acquisition which was completed during the last week of the first quarter of direct marketing spending increased in absolute dollars in  while remaining flat as a percentage of revenues when compared with direct marketing and engineering spending in the voice communications solutions segment will fluctuate depending upon the timing of new product launches and marketing programs 
services year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of service revenue pts revenues from our services segment increased by in over to million  due primarily to increased video related services and  to a lesser extent  increased network systems related services  partially offset by a decrease in voice related services 
revenues from our video related services grew year over year in spite of the decline in video communications product revenues as a result of long term maintenance contracts and maintenance renewals from our installed base 
revenues from our services segment increased by in over to million  due primarily to increased video related services and  to a lesser extent  increased network systems related services 
in addition  a full year of revenues from services related to products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for of the increase over the year ago period 
international revenues  defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total service revenues for  and  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for our services segment for  or overall  the services segment contribution margin as a percentage of service segment revenues increased percentage points in versus due primarily to increased gross margins and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
gross margins increased as a percentage of revenue by percentage points primarily as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than the related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
overall  the services segment contribution margin remained flat as a percentage of service segment revenues in versus gross margins and operating expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of revenues 
gross margins have been impacted by increased service costs  including increased headcount related costs  repair costs and shipping costs 
service gross margins were negatively impacted during by negative gross margins on the installation of our rpx telepresence product 
we expect our service segment operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our professional services practice and leverage our partnerships to expand our practice into core service offerings 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
cash and cash equivalents includes cash in the bank of approximately million and the remaining million is comprised primarily of highly liquid investments in commercial paper  us government securities  municipal securities  time deposits  savings accounts  money market funds and corporate debt securities with original maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government securities  corporate debt securities and corporate preferred equity securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million that are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements 
our total cash and cash equivalents and investments held in the united states totaled million as of december   and the remaining million was held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
if we would need to access our cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in order to fund acquisitions  share repurchases or our working capital needs  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to decreased inventory  decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and increased accounts payable  and a larger decrease in deferred taxes 
partially offsetting these positive effects were decreased net income and non cash expenses  an increase in trade receivables and a smaller increase in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  a decrease in accounts receivable and a larger increase in other accrued liabilities 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in inventories  a large decrease in accounts payable  a larger increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a larger increase in other accrued liabilities 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities and million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million proceeds from investments  net of purchases of investments 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of our common stock  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  we expect that dso will remain in the to day range but could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  an increase in international receivables which typically have longer payment terms and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities which also have customarily longer payment terms 
dso could be negatively impacted in the current economic environment if our partners experience difficulty in financing purchases  which results in delays in payment to us 
inventory turns increased from turns at december  to turns at december  the increase in inventory turns was a result of the decrease in our finished goods inventory levels at the end of compared to the end of in  the growth in our finished goods inventory levels during the year was primarily a result of lower revenues than planned  the difference in planned versus actual sales mix of products  as well as weaker revenue linearity  growth in service inventory levels and other factors 
we believe inventory turns will fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and the mix of ocean freight versus air freight costs 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses 
table of contents on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  our hedging costs can vary depending upon the size of our hedge program  whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the us dollar and interest rate spreads between the us and other foreign markets 
additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any excluded and ineffective portions of a hedging instrument would be recorded as other income expense 
from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans for us to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
we continue to closely monitor our repurchase program in light of the current economic environment 
as a result  we substantially reduced our share repurchase activity during as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for our common stock repurchases and the resultant accumulated deficit included in stockholder s equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million to secure the leases on some of our offices 

table of contents the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
total estimated sublease income is million and is netted in the amounts below 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to stockholders equity in the amount of million and million would be an adjustment to tax expense 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
additional financing may not be available  particularly in the current credit environment or  if available  such financing may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us and could be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing 
table of contents basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products ratably over the service period  generally one to five years 
our video communications products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through our maintenance contracts 
accordingly  we account for revenue for these products in accordance with asc software 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
the company accrues for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense our share based compensation programs consist of grants of share based awards to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  as well as our employee stock purchase plan 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of these awards  including the effect of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of performance shares is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved 
compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes in the probable outcome of performance related conditions until the award vests 
the fair value of a performance share with a market condition is estimated on the date of award  using a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the total return ranking of our stock among the russell index companies over each performance period 
changes in the underlying factors and assumptions utilized may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance related to net operating losses generated in denmark 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

table of contents fair value fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as the basis for considering such assumptions  a three tier value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require us to develop our own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires us to use observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts 
the company s cash and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using inputs such as quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market funds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include us treasury securities and other government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper  preferred stocks and puts on treasury bond futures 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   our fixed income available for sale securities include us treasury obligations and other government agency instruments  corporate bonds  commercial paper  municipal securities and money market funds 
included in available for sale securities is cash equivalents  which consist of investments with maturities of three months or less and include money market funds 
our non fixed income available for sale securities represent preferred stocks and puts on treasury bond futures as part of a capital gains capture program that generates capital gains to offset capital losses 
the principal market where we execute our foreign currency contracts is the retail market in an over the counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency 
the market participants and the company s counterparties are large money center banks and regional banks 
the company s foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources specifically  spot exchange rates  libor rates and credit default rates and do not involve management judgment 
these contracts are typically classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
for the fair value of the company s marketable securities and foreign currency contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of december  we assess our purchased intangibles for impairment on an ongoing basis 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on events in the fourth quarter of  we performed an assessment of our purchased intangibles and we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december  and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million 
there were no impairment charges recorded in as no impairment indicators existed 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for example  to date  due to these and other factors  we have recorded cumulative charges against earnings totaling million associated with the impairment of these investments  including million in the second quarter of at december  and december   our strategic investments had a carrying value of million 
derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not 
table of contents designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
fasb accounting standards codification in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc  the authoritative guidance for gaap 
the codification is the single source of us gaap used by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements  except for rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative accounting guidance for sec registrants 
the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for the company beginning july  and the company has incorporated the current codification in this form k 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for the company beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect  if any  on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  asu fair value measurements disclosures update which is effective for the company beginning january  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
the company believes adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate debt securities  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we also invest in corporate preferred equity securities as part of a capital gains capture program 
these corporate preferred equity securities are primarily comprised of investment grade  non convertible utility preferred stocks that are generally rated the equivalent of bbb or better by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
while an active market exists for these securities  preferred equity securities are not as actively traded as common stock 
table of contents equity securities 
further  while we have the ability to hold these investments  if we decided to sell these securities within a short period of time  we could incur significant losses 
at december   the fair value of these corporate preferred equity securities is million compared to our cost basis of million 
these investments in the capital gains capture program are typically hedged for interest rate fluctuations  which may not be effective  however these hedges are generally not significant 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities and corporate preferred equity securities 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  particularly in light of the recent credit market instability 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may realize losses on the sale of our investments or we may incur further temporary impairment charges requiring us to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we could also incur additional other than temporary impairment charges resulting in realized losses in our statement of operations which would reduce net income 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security or issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow any anticipated recovery in the market value 
further  if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale takes place 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
we model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps foreign currency exchange rate risk while the majority of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  we also sell our products and services in certain european regions in euros and in british pounds  which has increased our risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires the company to only enter into hedge contracts with banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 
as of december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  sell million british pounds at  and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in days or less 
we also have a cash flow hedging program under which we hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound and israeli shekels 
as of december   we 
table of contents had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of less than days 
as of december   we also had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
