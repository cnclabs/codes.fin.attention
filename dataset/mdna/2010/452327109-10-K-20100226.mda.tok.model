item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements  and see risk factors in 
table of contents item a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer  and marketer of integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function 
using our proprietary technologies  we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing  genotyping  and gene expression markets  and we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics 
our customers include leading genomic research centers  pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  clinical research organizations  and biotechnology companies 
we develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to perform a range of analyses  including de novo sequencing  whole genome re sequencing  gene expression analysis  and small rna analysis 
our product and service offerings also include leading edge solutions for single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping  copy number variation cnv  dna methylation studies  gene expression profiling  and low multiplex analysis of dna  rna  and protein 
we believe we are the only company with genome scale technology for sequencing  genotyping  and gene expression the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 
our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance  throughput  cost effectiveness  and flexibility necessary to determine and analyze the billions of bits of genetic information needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics 
we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function  which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research  allow diseases to be detected earlier  and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 
during the first quarter of  we reorganized our operating structure into a newly created life sciences business unit  which includes all products and services that are primarily related to the research market  namely those based on our sequencing  beadarray and veracode technologies 
we also created a diagnostics business unit to focus on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics 
for the year ended january   we had limited activity related to the diagnostics business unit and operating results were reported on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker  the chief executive officer 
accordingly  we operated in one segment for the year ended january  we will begin reporting in two segments once revenues  operating profit or loss  or assets of the diagnostics business unit exceed of the consolidated amounts 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item of this report 
business trends and outlook our financial results have been  and will continue to be  impacted by several significant trends  which are described below next generation sequencing strong demand for next generation sequencing applications continues to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable sales 
in we made advances to our sequencing technology  including enhanced chemistry  algorithms  and hardware which substantially improved accuracy  read length  data density  and ease of use 
the combination of these advances increased the output and decreased the cost of sequencing and expanded the number of applications that researchers can perform on our sequencing systems 
in early we expect to begin customer shipments of our recently announced hiseq next generation sequencing instrument  which we believe will allow customers to sequence whole human genomes for less than  in reagent costs 
we anticipate our revenue for will have higher growth in the second half of the year 
table of contents compared to the first half due to the timing of the manufacturing scale up of the hiseq and other significant product launches scheduled for later in the year 
we believe that as the cost of next generation sequencing continues to decline  the number of samples available for sequencing will significantly increase 
genome wide association studies gwas we experienced a slowdown in the sales of our microarray products during that was largely attributable to researchers reducing or suspending the initiation of new studies as they waited for rare variant content emerging from the genomes project  an international research effort launched in to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation 
despite advances in sequencing technology  we believe microarrays remain a cheaper  faster and materially more accurate technology for use when genetic content is known 
the information content of specific microarrays is fixed and reproducible  as such  specific microarrays provide repeatable  standardized assays for certain subsets of bases within the overall genome 
during  as part of our previously announced gwas roadmap  we plan to launch arrays that will feature millions of more markers per beadchip and new rare variant content from the genomes project 
as these arrays become available  we believe activity in the microarray market will increase relative to american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act the recovery act was enacted in february to provide stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the economic downturn 
as part of the recovery act legislation  over billion in funding was provided to the national institute of health nih through september to support the advancement of scientific research 
in the second and third quarters of we experienced negative unintended consequences of the recovery act as customers delayed orders while they waited to receive stimulus funds 
during the fourth quarter of  we believe we saw an increase in the distribution of recovery act funds and received an estimated million in orders directly related to recovery act grants 
we believe a significant portion of recovery act awards may be distributed in  which may create a pipeline of opportunity in the upcoming year 
life science research funding across regional markets we have developed a broad sales and distribution network with a sales presence in more than countries 
our financial results will continue to be impacted by significant regional trends in life science research funding as described below united states 
a significant increase to the nih budget in addition to recovery act stimulus funds has made for a strong funding environment in the united states that we expect to continue into asia pacific 
strong funding in china was partially offset by a funding decrease in japan due to a change in government that resulted in the suspension of supplemental life science research funding during the second and third quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we saw an increase in activity in the japanese market as funds began to be released  which we expect to continue into europe 
central and southern european markets had a strong year driven by the establishment and expansion of genome centers 
however  there was a decrease in funding in northern european countries  primarily due to reduced institutional funding in areas like the united kingdom and the financial crisis in iceland 
we saw some positive signs during the fourth quarter of in northern europe  and  although we expect funding to stabilize  we do not expect a material increase in activity in this region in cost of revenue our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue declined during due to cost efficiencies in our manufacturing process and an improved mix of sequencing consumables driven by growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems 
we expect changes in our product mix to continue to affect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  particularly in the latter half of the year 
we anticipate cost of revenue as a 
table of contents percentage of revenue to be lower in the first half of the year and then increase as the mix shifts to newer products and the effects of our trade in promotions associated with the launch of the hiseq are realized 
additionally  we expect price competition to continue in our market causing added variability in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly and annual basis 
operating expense we expect to incur additional operating costs to support the expected growth in our business 
as a result of revenues growing faster in the second half of  we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to be higher in the first half of the year compared with the second half 
we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base 
selling  general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our staff and add sales and marketing infrastructure 
while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results  the other transactions  events and trends discussed in risk factors in item a of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 

table of contents results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january   december  and december  stated as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended january  december  december  revenue product revenue service and other revenue total revenue costs and expenses cost of product revenue excluding impairment of manufacturing equipment and amortization of intangible assets cost of service and other revenue research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of manufacturing equipment amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development litigation settlements total costs and expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of years ended january  and december  our fiscal year is the or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  and september the year ended january  was weeks and the year end december  was weeks 

table of contents revenue year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 
consumable revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended december  microarray consumable revenue  which constituted more than half of our consumable revenue  declined million  or  primarily attributable to lower sales of whole genome genotyping arrays partially offset by growth in focused content arrays 
the decline was driven by customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the genome project  order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 
sales volume for our infinium beadchip product lines  which constitute a majority of our microarray consumable sales  was relatively flat on a sample basis during compared to the average selling price per sample  however  declined due to a change in product mix attributable to growth in the sales of our focused content arrays coupled with lower sales of whole genome genotyping arrays and an increase in the average number of samples per beadchip 
revenue from sequencing consumables increased million  or  driven by growth in the installed base of our genome analyzer systems and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 
the increase was partially offset by a loss of sales related to a quality issue affecting our paired end cluster kits that arose in september when some of our larger sequencing customers began experiencing higher than average error rates on the second read of their paired end analysis 
during the fourth quarter  we began shipping reformulated paired end cluster kits at full capacity and cleared the related shipping backlog 
revenue from the sale of instruments increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million  or  increase in sales of our sequencing systems 
during as compared to both units sold and average selling prices increased for our genome analyzer systems  which constitute a majority of sequencing instrument revenue 
the increase in units sold was driven by increased demand for next generation sequencing and our sequencing by synthesis technology 
the increase in average selling prices was attributable to the product transition from the genome analyzer i to the genome analyzer ii in the second quarter of and technological improvements leading to the launch of the genome analyzer iix in the second quarter of the increase in sequencing instrument revenue was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in the sales of our microarray systems  which declined primarily due to customers delaying the start of new gwas in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the genomes project  order delays directly related to stimulus funding under the recovery act and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of revenue 
table of contents total cost of revenue  which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets  remained flat despite higher sales  primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs and improved efficiencies 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was for the year ended january   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation 
the cost of sequencing consumables decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits launched at the end of the third quarter of the cost of sequencing instruments decreased as a percentage of related revenue due to production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with higher average selling prices 
operating expenses year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses the increase in research and development was driven primarily by a million increase in personnel related expenses  including salaries  non cash stock based compensation and benefits  a million increase to non personnel related expenses and an increase in outside services of million attributable to consulting fees 
these increases are primarily related to the growth in our efforts to optimize and commercialize our sequencing and beadarray technologies 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was driven by an increase of million in personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business  including salaries  non cash stock based compensation and benefits 
acquired in process research and development ipr d year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands acquired in process research and development during the year ended december   we recorded acquired ipr d charges of million as a result of the avantome  inc acquisition in august during the year ended january   we recorded additional ipr d charges of million related to milestone payments made to avantome inc s former shareholders 
other income expense  net year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands interest income interest expense other income  net total other expense  net 
table of contents interest income decreased despite an increase in our average cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in interest rates during interest expense increased due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes 
other income  net decreased due to a decrease of million in gains on net foreign currency transactions  which was partially offset by a gain of million on the conversion of a portion of our debt during the first quarter of provision for income taxes year ended january  december  percentage change change in thousands provision for income taxes the increase in the provision for income taxes was attributable to the increase in the consolidated income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate decreased from in to in predominately because the amount of nondeductible acquired ipr d recognized for financial reporting purposes was lower by million 
additionally  the percentage of consolidated income before income taxes earned in foreign jurisdictions  which primarily have lower statutory tax rates than the us statutory tax rate  increased from in to in comparison of years ended december  and december  our fiscal year is or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  and september the years ended december  and december  were both weeks 
revenue year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of consumables and instruments 
revenue from the sale of consumables increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium and sequencing products  which led to increased sales of million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue associated with our infinium products was attributable to the strong demand for our infinium high density beadchips  particularly the human quad  which we began shipping during the first quarter of of the overall increase in infinium beadchip sales  approximately was due to new product introductions with higher average selling prices  while the remaining can be attributed to increased volume 
the increase in sequencing consumables was primarily attributable to the growth of our installed base of instruments and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale 
revenue from the sale of instruments increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales of our genome analyzer driven by both an increase in sales volume and average selling prices 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we launched the iscan system  our next generation beadchip scanner to replace the beadarray reader 
any increase in revenue resulting from shipments of this new system was offset by a reduction in sales of our beadarray reader as we stopped manufacturing this product upon the launch of our iscan system 

table of contents cost of product and service and other revenue year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue total cost of revenue  which excludes the impairment of manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible assets  increased primarily due to higher instrument and consumable sales 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to favorable product mix driven by increased sales of our new high density infinium beadchips  with higher average selling prices as compared to the infinium beadchips sold in the prior year 
this was partially offset by increased provisions for inventory obsolescence of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the inventory reserve was primarily associated with product transitions 
during the year  we recorded reserves for product obsolescence associated with the launch of our new infinium beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit 
instrument cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly over the prior year due to lower average selling prices mainly associated with promotional campaigns as we launched our next generation beadarray reader  the iscan in the first half of operating expenses year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses the increase in research and development was driven by a million increase in personnel related expenses associated with increased headcount  including salaries  non cash stock based compensation and benefits  an million increase to non personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business and a million increase to accrued compensation expense associated with contingent consideration for the avantome acquisition completed on august  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside services of million primarily related to a decrease in consulting fees 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by an increase of million in personnel related expenses  including salaries  non cash stock based compensation and benefits and a million increase to non personnel related expenses 
these increases were primarily associated with the growth of our business 
acquired in process research and development ipr d year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands acquired in process research and development 
table of contents as a result of the avantome  inc acquisition in august and the solexa inc acquisition in january  we recorded acquired ipr d charges of million and million  respectively 
litigation settlements year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands litigation settlements during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with two settlement agreements 
the total charge is comprised primarily of million related to a million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january  for certain patent litigation between the parties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the affymetrix settlement 
other income expense  net year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other expense  net interest income decreased due to a change in our cash and investment portfolio to a mix of shorter duration maturities and an increased number of agency rated investments coupled with the overall decline in interest rates due to market conditions 
interest expense increased due to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes and an additional month and a half of interest expense recorded in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other income expense  net increased primarily due to million in net foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended december  compared to immaterial losses recorded in the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes year ended december  december  percentage change change in thousands provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes in was different than in primarily because the amount of nondeductible acquired ipr d recognized for financial reporting purposes was lower by million 
in addition  for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was reduced by million as a result of the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow summary year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of foreign currency translation net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  consists of net income of million plus net non cash adjustments of million and an million increase in net operating assets 
the primary non cash expenses added back to net income included share based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment  intangibles and the debt discount on our convertible notes totaling million 
the main drivers in the change in net operating assets included increases in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these increases were primarily related to the growth of our business 
investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended january  we purchased and sold available for sale securities totaling million and million  respectively 
we incurred million in capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure at our san diego  hayward and uk locations 
additionally  in january  we executed a strategic alliance with oxford nanopore technologies  which consisted of a commercialization agreement and an million equity investment 
we also agreed to make an additional equity investment upon the achievement of a specific technical milestone 
in august  we completed our acquisition of avantome  inc as consideration for the acquisition  we paid million in cash  including transaction costs  at the closing of the acquisition  and have subsequently paid million as of february  based on the achievement of  or amendments relating to  certain milestones 
we may pay up to an additional million in contingent cash consideration to avantome s former shareholders based on the achievement of certain remaining milestones 
in january  as part of our affymetrix settlement  we recorded a million intangible asset for licensed technology obtained in the settlement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding intangible assets 
in january of  we completed our acquisition of solexa  inc in a stock for stock merger transaction 
the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock as consideration for this merger 
the acquisition resulted in net cash acquired of million 
financing activities cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended january  during the year we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million  which was partially offset by million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and million of incremental tax benefits related to stock options exercised 

table of contents in august  we issued a total of million shares at a public offering price of per share  raising net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
during the year ended december   we also repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
in february  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses  were approximately million 
we used million of the net proceeds to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering 
we used million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our convertible senior notes 
liquidity we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity 
our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating  investing and financing needs 
historically  we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs 
we may require additional funding in the future and our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
at january   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
short term investments include marketable securities and auction rate securities totaling million and million  respectively 
our marketable securities consist of debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities and u 
s treasury notes 
we do not hold securities backed by mortgages 
our auction rate securities were issued primarily by municipalities and universities 
the markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when the vast majority of auctions failed in february  preventing investors from selling their auction rate securities 
as of january   the securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid 
in november  we signed a settlement agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs ag ubs at our discretion during the period of june  through july  because we intend to exercise this right when it becomes available  we have classified our auction rate securities as short term on the balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our auction rate securities 
our outstanding convertible senior notes were convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock for the period from april  through december  and became convertible again beginning april  through december  on december   a noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
on february   the settlement date  we paid the noteholder the conversion value of the notes in cash  up to the principal amount of the notes 
the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount  totaling million  was paid in shares of common stock 
this equity dilution upon conversion of the notes was offset by the reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions and investments  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the united states and abroad  the continued advancement of research and development efforts  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  
table of contents improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  and the expansion needs of our facilities  including costs of leasing additional facilities 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs in  barring unforeseen circumstances 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
during the fiscal year ended january   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january   aggregated by type amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years debt obligations operating leases contingent consideration amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan total excludes million of uncertain tax benefits 
we have not included this amount in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible senior notes and interest payments totaling per annum 
although these notes mature in  we classify the notes as current liabilities because the conditions to convertibility were satisfied during the last three fiscal quarters of 
table of contents and may be satisfied during certain quarters in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes 
the million included within contingent consideration is the amount owed to the former shareholders of avantome  inc for the achievement of a certain date specific milestones 
the table excludes million in additional contingent cash consideration we may be required to pay based on the achievement of certain additional milestones that do not have a fixed funding date and are subject to certain conditions that may or may not occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  market and other conditions and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control 
if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate  our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected 
in addition  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments 
in addition  had we used estimates different from any of these  our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented 
members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates  and our disclosure regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue primarily consists of sales of arrays  reagents  flow cells and instrumentation 
service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services  extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer or agreed to milestones are reached 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 

table of contents sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one year  starting upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its products under warranty were greater than its estimates  gross margins could be adversely affected 
we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products and or services 
these products and or services are generally delivered within a short time frame  approximately three to six months  of the contract execution date 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
for transactions entered into in  consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
see recent accounting pronouncements in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to our change in authoritative accounting guidance for revenue recognition 
for transactions entered into prior to  consideration was generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement 
the fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the product  if the item was regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
when we were unable to establish stand alone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product and or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there is not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price 
due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry  we have rarely established selling price using third party evidence 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we determine its best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling month period as well as market conditions 
if the product or service has no history of sales  we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
investments we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use 
table of contents of unobservable inputs 
we use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
in using this fair value hierarchy  management may be required to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk  specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
these assumptions are judgmental in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding  review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supersede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  to the extent losses are reasonably estimable 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  past history  scientific and other evidence  and the specifics and status of each matter 
we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes  which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 
business combinations and intangible asset valuation under the purchase method of accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these 
table of contents valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the company s intangible assets are comprised primarily of licensed technology from the affymetrix settlement entered into on january  and acquired core technology and customer relationships from the solexa acquisition 
management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our intangible assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
we test for potential impairment of goodwill annually in our second fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise 
in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
we had a total of million in goodwill  million in net property and equipment and million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet at january  in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach 
the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions  including market factors specific to the business  the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time  long term growth rates for the business  and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
when using the market approach  we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses 
we base our judgments on factors such as size  growth rates  profitability  risk  and return on investment 
we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue  operating income  and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets and goodwill 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

table of contents convertible senior notes during the first quarter of  we adopted new authoritative guidance that significantly impacts the accounting for our convertible senior notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the notes 
the liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the notes reflects the issuer s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the notes and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
stock based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of stock based awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price  expected option life  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate 
we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options  adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors 
implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange traded call options on our common stock 
the expected option life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience  exercise activity and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees 
we determined expected dividend yield to be given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the us and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates and estimates of the company s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include the cumulative pre tax book income for the past three years  scheduled 
table of contents reversals of deferred tax liabilities  our history of earnings and reliable forecasting  projections of pre tax book income over the foreseeable future  and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
based on the available evidence as of january   we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets  respectively 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company s return filing positions 
due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability 
these differences  as well as any interest and penalties  will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
for example  if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of january  market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce potential equity dilution  in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  entitling us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a net share basis  for up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the anti dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions  if any  could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants  which occur during  assuming the warrants are exercised 
foreign currency exchange risk many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s us dollar functional currency 
these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro  yen  british pound sterling  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income loss 
we recognized a 
table of contents net currency exchange gain on business transactions  net of hedging transactions  of million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively  which are included in other income expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  we began using forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one month or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income loss  as they have not been designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts  which settle monthly  effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled  so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
at january   we had an immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk
