item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our principal business is attracting deposits from small businesses and consumers and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in commercial business loans and various types of commercial real estate loans 
in  the company expects to fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the company s market area 
the company s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available 
the company s results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements in item hereof 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
we consider the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy that requires judicious estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are particularly susceptible to significant change 
for further information  see business allowances for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
operating results general 
for the year ended december   the company reported net loss of  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the million decrease in the company s pre tax income loss for compared to was due primarily to a million increase in provision for loan losses  and a million increase in noninterest expense  primarily associated with higher costs related to federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance premiums  other real estate owned operations  net and professional fees  partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expense 
offsetting the above items were the following a million increase in net interest income due to a higher level of interest earning assets and a higher net interest margin  and a million favorable change in noninterest income loss category  primarily associated with a lower otti charge taken on private label securities in and higher deposit fee income  partially offset by lower loan servicing fee income and losses on loan sales  compared to gains in the prior year 
for  our return on average assets was a negative and our return on average equity was a negative 
these compare to our returns of on average assets and on average equity 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the million  or  decrease in net income in compared to was primarily the result of a charge of million pre tax  or per diluted shares after tax  associated with the termination of the mutual funds investment held by the company and of an otti charge of million  or per diluted share after tax  that was recorded on private label mbss that the company received when it redeemed its shares in the mutual funds in the second quarter of net interest income 
our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread and the relative dollar amount of these assets and liabilities principally affects our net interest income 
net interest income totaled million in  up million or from the increase reflected a million or increase in average interest earning assets to million and an increase of basis points in the net interest margin to in the increase in from a year ago primarily reflected the average costs on interest bearing liabilities decreasing more rapidly than the average yield on interest earning assets 
the slower decline in interest earning assets was primarily due to interest rate floors we have on our adjustable rate loans  which allowed only a basis point decrease in yield 
in contrast  our cost of funds declined basis points  primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates that lowered our deposit rates by basis points 
the lower yield on our interest earning assets was also unfavorably impacted by a lower yield on our investment securities of basis points 
this decline was primarily due to our decision to reduce the credit risk exposure in the securities portfolio by selling private label securities with higher credit risk and replacing them with lower yielding  lower credit risk gse securities 
these gse securities also enhanced our regulatory capital as they have a lower asset risk weighting than the private label securities 
net interest income was million in  up million from million in interest income for was million  compared to million for the decrease of million or was primarily due to interest income on loans receivable decreasing million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the average yield of basis points primarily due to the repricing of our short term adjustable rate income property loans as general market interest rates declined during interest expense in was million  compared to million in the million  or  decrease was primarily due to a decrease of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities resulting from the lower interest rate environment during the following table presents for the years indicated the average dollar amounts from selected balance sheet categories calculated from daily average balances and the total dollar amount  including adjustments to yields and costs  of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense incurred from average interest bearing liabilities and resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  net interest rate spread and net interest rate margin for the years indicated 
the net interest rate margin reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals our net interest rate spread divided by average interest earning assets for the year

changes in our net interest income are a function of changes in both volumes and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents the impact the volume and rate changes have had on our net interest income for the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  we have provided information on changes to our net interest income with respect to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes in interest rates changes in interest rates multiplied by prior volume  and the net change or the combined impact of volume and rate changes allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in interest rates

during  the provision for loan losses totaled million  up from million in and million in the increase of million in the current year provision was primarily due to the weakness in the california economy and our recent charge off history  which were the dominating factors in determining our provision and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses during net loan charge offs amounted to million  up from million in and million in the recent loan charge offs we have experienced are in response to the uncertainty and recessionary conditions in our primary markets as well as constraints on the financial markets in which we lend 
these conditions continue to adversely affect our borrowers and their businesses and  consequently  the collateral securing our loans 
the increase in the provision for loan losses from of million or was primarily due to increases in the company s net charge offs of  and its unallocated allowance of  the increase in the unallocated allowance is attributable to management s expectation of the continued weakening of the economy and the impact it has on our borrowers ability to repay their loans 
noninterest income 
noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the favorable change between years of million or was primarily due to a lower loss on the sale of investments of million  mostly associated with a loss of million from the sale of mutual fund investment securities in  partially offset by lower loan servicing fees of million and an unfavorable change in losses on the sales of loans of  in noninterest income decreased million  or  from to  primarily due to a million otti charge in  the loss of million from the sale of the mutual fund investments in and a decrease in income generated by loan sales of million  compared to the same period in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for was million  compared to million for the million or increase in noninterest expense was principally due to increases in fdic insurance premiums of million and higher expenses for other real estate owned of  which was partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefits of million and marketing expenses of  the decrease in compensation and benefits during is attributable primarily to staff reductions related to the company s overall lower loan production levels in at december   the number of full time equivalent employees at the company was  compared to at december  and at december  noninterest expense for totaled million  compared to million for the million  or  decrease was primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits of million and legal and audit expenses of  the decrease in compensation and benefits for the year is attributable primarily to staff reductions  which occurred during the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of related to lower loan production levels in as compared to the decrease in legal expense was primarily due to higher legal fees in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit in income taxes 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of  in  compared to a provision for income taxes of  in and million in the company had loss before income taxes of million in  compared to income before income taxes of million in and million in financial condition at december   total assets of the company were million  up million or from total assets of million at december  the increase was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million partially offset by a decrease in loans held for investment of million 
at december   total liabilities of the company were million  compared to million at december  the million  or  increase during was primarily due to an increase in deposits of million to million  partially offset by a decrease in borrowings of million to million 
at december   our stockholders equity amounted to million  compared to million at december  the increase of million or in stockholders equity is primarily due to a successful capital raise in the fourth quarter of the company raised gross proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the company injected million of the proceeds from the offering into the bank  which enhanced the bank s regulatory capital ratios 
liquidity our primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans  deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation 
our liquid assets are comprised of cash and unpledged investments 
at december   our average liquidity ratios was  compared to at december  and at december  the liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged securities by the sum of deposits that mature in one year or less plus transaction accounts and fhlb advances 
our liquidity is monitored daily 
we believe the level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding needs 
at december   liquid assets of the company represented approximately of total assets  compared to at december  and at december  at december   the company had five unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling million to purchase federal funds as business needs dictate 
we also have a line of credit with the fhlb allowing us to borrow up to of the bank s total assets 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million  based on collateral pledged at the fhlb  of which million was outstanding 
the fhlb advance line is collateralized by eligible loan collateral and fhlb stock 
at december   we had approximately million of loans pledged to secure fhlb borrowings 
we had no outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans at december   december  and december  at december   the company s loan to deposit and borrowing ratio was  compared to at december  the decline in the ratio from year end to was primarily associated with decreasing loan balance and higher deposit balances that more than offset a decline in borrowings 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
we expect to retain a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit at maturity 
the company has a policy in place that permits the purchase of brokered funds  in an amount not to exceed of total deposits  as a secondary source for funding 
at december   the balance of brokered time deposits was approximately million 
the corporation is a company separate and apart from the bank that must provide for its own liquidity 
the corporation s primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that such restrictions will not have a material impact on the ability of the corporation to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a a bank s retained earnings  or b bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
under these provisions  the amount available for distribution from the bank to the corporation was approximately million at december  in february  the boards of directors of the corporation and the bank adopted certain board resolutions which require  among other things  that we provide prior written notice to the federal reserve bank before i receiving any dividends or other distributions from the bank  ii declaring any dividends or making any payments on trust preferred securities or subordinated debt  iii making any capital distributions  iv incurring  increasing  refinancing or guaranteeing any debt  v issuing any trust preferred securities or iv repurchasing  redeeming or acquiring any of our stock 
capital resources the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised gross proceeds of million in capital by issuing  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the company injected million of the proceeds from the offering into the bank  which enhanced the bank s regulatory capital ratios 
at december   the bank s leverage capital amounted to million and risk based capital amounted to million 
at december   the bank s leverage capital was million and risk based capital was million 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines under prompt corrective action rules  a bank must have total risk based capital of or greater  tier risk based capital of or greater and tier i capital to adjusted tangible assets of or greater to be considered well capitalized 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  tier risk based capital ratio was and tier i capital ratio was 
contractual obligations and commitments the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet required capital needs 
the following schedule summarizes maturities and payments due on our obligations and commitments  excluding accrued interest  as of december  less than year years years more than years total in thousands contractual obligations fhlb borrowings other borrowings subordinated debentures certificates of deposit operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments with off balance sheet risk as of december  commitment expiration by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands other unused commitments home equity lines of credit commercial lines of credit other lines of credit standby letters of credit total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts except with respect to securities classified as available for sale which are carried at market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss or reduced earnings from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis and frequency than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income 
in addition to the interest rate risk associated with our lending for investment and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with our loans held for sale 
changes in interest rates  primarily fixed rate loans  impact the fair value of loans held for sale 
rising interest rates typically result in a decrease in loan market value while declining interest rates typically result in an increase in loan market value 
our asset liability committee is responsible for implementing the bank s interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and economic value of equity eve from specified changes in interest rates 
our asset liability committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
based on these reviews  our asset liability committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and eve limits set forth in our guidelines approved by our board of directors 
interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk and manage the risk consistent with prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines approved by our board of directors 
we monitor asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and review various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling the company s interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
our primary strategy in managing interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination for investment of adjustable rate loans or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate loans are primarily tied to month or month london inter bank offered rate libor index  month moving average of yields on actively traded us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year mta index and the wall street journal prime rate prime index 
also as part of this strategy  we seek to lengthen our deposit maturities when deposit rates are considered in the lower end of the interest rate cycle and shorten our deposit maturities when deposit rates are considered in the higher end of the interest rate cycle 
management monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the company s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital in various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
if interest rates rise we may be subject to interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices  to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and interest rate caps and floors on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the extent of the interest rate spread compression depends  among other things  upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
economic value of equity 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in the company s eve under alternative interest rate scenarios  primarily parallel  instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
the model computes the net present value of capital by discounting all expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts under each rate scenario 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current eve assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once this base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any anticipated differences in the prepayment speeds of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and eve due to the changes in interest rates 
an eve ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the eve ratio  in basis points  caused by an increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the following table shows the eve and projected change in the eve of the company at december   assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp as of december  dollars in thousands eve as of portfolio economic value of equity value of assets change in rates amount change change eve ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp static bp bp bp bp bp bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in eve requires numerous assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the company s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the eve measurement provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the company s primary categories of assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year  including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mbss that have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities  such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts is also adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
in addition  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented 
all certificates of deposit and borrowings are presented by maturity date 
the weighted average interest rates for the various assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration historical prepayment trends adjusted for current market conditions to determine expected maturity categories  changes in prepayment behavior can be triggered by changes in variables  including market rates of interest 
unexpected changes in these variables may increase or decrease the rate of prepayments from those anticipated 
as such  the potential loss from such market rate changes may be significantly larger
