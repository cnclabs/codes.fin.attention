item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs targeting the microenvironment of solid tumors as novel treatments for patients living with cancer 
the microenvironment of solid tumors is characterized by  among other things  hypoxia or lack of oxygen  disordered blood vessel growth  and the upregulation of glucose transport 
this hypoxic environment is known to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation 
it is thought to be responsible for the poor prognosis of many solid tumors and treating the hypoxic environment is currently believed to be a significant unmet medical need 
our product candidates are designed to selectively target the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors either by selective toxin activation in the case of our hypoxia activated prodrug hap program  including th  or potentially utilizing the consequences of increased uptake of glucose in cancer cells relative to most normal cells 
our product candidates dg and the recently out licensed product candidate glufosfamide share certain structural characteristics with glucose but act instead as chemotherapeutic toxins when taken up by a cell 
our focus is on product candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer 
we have two product candidates for which we have exclusive worldwide marketing rights th  which we discovered  is our lead product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
it is a novel drug candidate that is activated under the severe hypoxic conditions and was designed to specifically target the severe hypoxic regions that are present in most solid tumors 
th is currently in phase and phase clinical trials 
in and first quarter of  we reported results from the dose escalation component and dose expansion components in metastatic melanoma and small cell lung cancer sclc of the monotherapy phase trial and interim results from each of the four chemotherapy plus th treatments phase combination trials 
we presented top line results from the monotherapy and combination therapy trials in the first quarter of and expect to present updated top line results from the monotherapy and combination therapy trials in the second quarter of we also expect to initiate at least one randomized controlled clinical trial with th in mid year dg is our product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer and has been evaluated in a phase clinical trial alone and in combination with docetaxel as a combination therapy 
this clinical trial began in the first quarter of and we completed enrollment in the first half of we presented top line results for this clinical trial in august we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 
we plan to seek a collaborator for the future development of dg 
we are working to discover additional hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 
we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates  and prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common 
table of contents stock that raised net proceeds of million 
in august  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  respectively  and our cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the second quarter of  including prosecuting our current ongoing clinical trials and conducting research and discovery efforts toward additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates in the near term 
from to  we recognized million in revenue related to the upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue has been recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  through december  in  the company had no further responsibilities for development activities under this agreement and in may  the company dissolved the joint development committee jdc comprising medibic and us 
no payments were made by either party as a result of the dissolution of the jdc 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will decrease significantly in the future as we progress with a reduced workforce and smaller clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value provisions of accounting standard codification asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method  except for options granted prior to our initial public offering in february  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   no revenue was recognized 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue was fully recognized on a straight line basis through  the estimated development period 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses  million in higher staffing and facilities expenses and million in higher consulting expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 
research and development expenses by project in thousands years ended december  th glufosfamide dg discovery research total research and development expenses research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for the increase of million was primarily due to million in clinical and manufacturing expenses and million in employee related expenses 
th continues to progress through the phase monotherapy clinical trial initiated in july  for which in the first quarter of  we expanded enrollment to explore activity in specific indications 
in addition th continues to progress through the phase combination therapy clinical trial  which includes three separate treatment arms and a phase combination therapy clinical trial of th in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma  both of which were initiated in third quarter of research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decline in expenses was due to the completion and announcement of results for our phase trials in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma in and discontinuation of our phase trials in recurrent sensitive sclc and platinum resistant ovarian cancer in october and january  respectively 
in october  we exclusively licensed development and commercialization of glufosfamide to eleison and as a result  we do not expect to incur research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide in the future 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  as we completed enrollment of our dg phase trial in second quarter of and announced results in third quarter of we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 

table of contents discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for  we continue to focus our efforts towards discovering and developing new drug candidates from our hypoxia activated prodrug platform 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million decrease in stock based compensation  million in lower staffing and facilities expense and million in lower consulting expenses 
we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same in compared to interest and other income interest and other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates during compared to the prior year 
interest and other expense interest and other expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the revaluation of our warrant liability  which resulted in a net charge of million in interest expense for results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue was recognized on a straight line basis through  the development period 
we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses is due to a million decrease in clinical and development expenses  million in lower staffing and facilities expenses due to a lower headcount compared to the prior year and million in lower consulting expenses 
staffing expenses in included million in severance expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and consultants compared to the prior year  as well as lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 
research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for the increase of million was primarily due to in employee 
table of contents related expenses and million in clinical and manufacturing expenses 
th continues to progress through the phase monotherapy clinical trial initiated in july  with enrollment completed in the fourth quarter of in addition  in the third quarter of  we initiated a phase combination therapy clinical trial of th which includes three separate treatment arms and a phase clinical trial of th in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma 
research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing expenses  a million decrease in employee related and stock compensation expenses and a million decrease in outside consulting expenses 
these declines in expenses were due to completion and announcement of results for our phase trials in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma in and discontinuation of our phase trials in recurrent sensitive sclc and platinum resistant ovarian cancer in october and january  respectively 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  as we completed enrollment of our dg phase trial in second quarter of and announced results in third quarter of we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 
we plan to seek a collaborator for the future development of dg 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to the allocation of resources towards our th program  and lower staffing and facilities expenses to support our other discovery research programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million in lower staffing and facilities expense  million decrease in stock based compensation  and million in lower consulting expenses 
staffing expenses in included million in severance expenses 
interest and other income interest and other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during compared to the prior year 
interest and other expense interest and other expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses since inception through december  of million 
we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of product candidates in the near term 
from inception until our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of million shares of our common stock split adjusted  raising net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock split adjusted for net proceeds of million 
in august  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to per share subject to adjustment 
we received aggregate gross proceeds of million in connection with the offering 
net proceeds generated from the offering were million 
in october  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common 
table of contents stock for a purchase price equal to per share and  for a purchase price equal to per share  warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to million in connection with the offering 
net proceeds generated from the offering were million 
in august  our board of directors approved a for reverse split of our common stock  effective august  accordingly  all references to common shares of stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split 
we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  revaluation of warrant liability and depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as an increase in accrued liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses  offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses  a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of million  offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in october  offset by repayments of notes payable totaling for the year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in august  offset by repayments of notes payable totaling for the year 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to repayments of notes payable during the year partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
we expect cash requirements to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the second quarter of  including completing our current trials  conducting research and discovery efforts towards additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we expect to need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our future operations 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  
table of contents licensing arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq capital market 
previously we had fallen out of compliance with continued listing requirements because our common stock did not comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a 
on august  our board of directors implemented a one for six reverse stock split  effective august   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on september   the nasdaq stock market notified us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price 
even though we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in the future  and our failure to do so could result in the delisting of our shares from the nasdaq capital market 
to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market  we are also required  among other things  to either maintain stockholders equity of at least million or a market value of at least million 
while we currently satisfy the stockholders equity requirement  we may not continue to do so 
on october   the nasdaq stock market suspended the enforcement of the minimum bid price and market value requirements through january  and on december   the suspension period was extended to april  the suspension period was subsequently extended to july  nasdaq s enforcement of these rules resumed on august  and nasdaq does not expect any further extensions of the suspension period 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million for working capital and equipment purchases 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount under this facility  which is being repaid over a month period from the dates of borrowing 
these borrowings bear interest at an average rate of per year at december  at december   all borrowing under this facility had been fully repaid 
in april  we amended the existing loan and security agreement to borrow up to an additional million for working capital and equipment purchases 
the interest rate for borrowings under this facility will be determined based on the month us treasury note plus on the date of borrowing 
we borrowed million under this facility  which was repaid over a month period from the date of borrowing 
the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
at june   borrowings under this facility were paid in full 
in august  we entered into a noncancelable facilities sublease agreement that originally expired on february  for our headquarters in redwood city  california 
in february  we entered into a lease 
table of contents for an additional  square feet of space and increased the lease term for the existing space located at our headquarters in redwood city  california to september  the lease is for a period of months  beginning on april  with respect to the additional square footage and will begin on march  with respect to the existing square footage 
the lease will expire  unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the lease  on september  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs and expenses associated with the premises as well as a customary management fee 
we are also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the lease  we furnished a letter of credit to the landlord for approximately million 
on april   we entered into a noncancelable facilities lease agreement that originally expired on february  for additional laboratory space in redwood city  california 
on november  we extended the term of the lease agreement to expire on august our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our financing and lease agreements  and purchase commitments 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december   are as follows in thousands within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total facilities sublease and lease purchase commitments total on october   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals  inc eleison 
pursuant to the agreement we granted eleison exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize glufosfamide for the treatment of cancer in humans and animals  and certain other uses 
under the agreement  eleison is responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of glufosfamide 
eleison and threshold will share equally in the profits of commercialization  if the further clinical development of glufosfamide leads to regulatory approval and marketing 
eleison will pay us of its profits from commercialization on a quarterly basis  beginning on the date of first commercial sale  if any 
eleison has the right to sublicense some or all of its rights under the agreement  and will pay us of amounts received under any sublicenses  including  without limitation  any royalty payments  license fee payments  milestone payments and payments for any equity or debt purchases by a sublicensee  within days of the receipt of any such amounts or payments by eleison 
eleison will bear all costs associated with development  commercialization and patent prosecution  and will control product development and commercialization 
in addition  eleison will be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments due under the baxter license and medibic development agreement discussed below 
the agreement contemplates that eleison  to satisfy its diligence obligations  will raise sufficient funds to commence clinical development activities with glufosfamide 
in november  we entered into an agreement with medibic to develop glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries  and received an upfront payment of million contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan 
in july  we finalized the development plan with medibic and began recognizing revenue from the upfront payment on a straight line basis over the development period  through december  we were responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
we will also be required to make royalty payments upon product commercialization 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by making certain payments ranging from million to million  depending on the stage of development of the glufosfamide product in japan 
in  we had no further responsibilities for development activities under this agreement and in may  we dissolved the joint development committee jdc comprising medibic and us 
no payments were made by either party as a result of the dissolution of the jdc 

table of contents in august  we entered into an agreement with baxter for the licensing and development of glufosfamide 
under this agreement  we paid baxter an upfront license fee of million and a million development milestone in we also made a development milestone payment of million in november and we are obligated to make certain additional development milestone payments  with the next payment due in connection with the filing of a new drug application with the fda for glufosfamide 
we will be required to make a milestone payment of million within days of filing an nda for glufosfamide with the fda 
future milestone payments in connection with the development of glufosfamide and united states and foreign regulatory submissions could total up to million  and sales based milestone payments could total up to million 
following regulatory approval  we will be obligated to pay up to mid single digit royalties to baxter based on sales of glufosfamide products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make development or sales based milestone or royalty payments to baxter 
under our license agreement with dr 
theodore j 
lampidis and dr 
waldemar priebe for rights under a patent and certain patent applications that generally cover the treatment of cancer with dg in combination with certain other cancer drugs  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments  including milestone payments of up to million in connection with the filing and approval of an nda for the first product covered by the licensed patents  as well as royalties based on sales of such products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make these milestone or royalty payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for california state income tax purposes 
during the year ended december   the company wrote down its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are expected to expire before utilization due to the annual limitation 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on 
table of contents various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of asc which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing asc including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc  equity 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each clinical trial and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based upon the levels of inputs described below  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
we adopted asc  fair value and measurements  in the first quarter of asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
our short term investments primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
asc requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy  the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation 
our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include securities available for sale 
securities available for sale include money market funds  government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
fair value of warrants prior to january   common stock warrants were recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging and asc  financial instruments 
however in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance now codified in asc that clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify for classification as a liability 
the new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the new guidance on january   resulted in the reclassification of our outstanding warrants from stockholders equity to liability and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our deficit accumulated during development stage of million 
in addition  the stock warrants are required to be fair valued at each reporting period  with the changes in fair value recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we fair value the warrants using a black scholes valuation model 
since the outstanding common stock warrants are fair valued at the end of each reporting period  any change in the underlying assumptions to the black scholes valuation model  including the volatility and price of our common stock  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
we will be required to apply this guidance prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   however  earlier application is permitted 
we have not determined the impact that this update may have on our financial statements 

table of contents on july   the fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc the codification 
asc establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for us gaap for use in financial statements  except for sec rules and interpretive releases  which are also authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
we have included the references to the codification  as appropriate  in these consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance now codified as asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  asc  investments debt and equity securities and asc  financial instruments  that was intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
asc clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured 
asc establishes a new model for measuring other than temporary impairments for debt securities  including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write down through earnings versus other comprehensive income 
asc expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments to interim periods 
the new guidance in these three asc topics was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the implementation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds and investments in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
