economic factors and trends the significant decline in the equity markets during and in early  which was partially offset by positive net cash flows  led to decreases in our us asset accumulation segment s account values and our global asset management segment s aum relative to year end since account values and aum are the base by which these businesses generate profits  the decline in account values and aum put pressure on our profits 
in our international asset management and accumulation segment  we continued to grow our business organically through our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures and through strategic acquisitions

as a result of the move to increase cash holdings during the year  current yields were lower than historically experienced 
although we will continue to invest a higher percentage of our assets in more liquid investments relative to historical levels  recent market conditions have allowed us to incrementally invest in other investments that are expected to enhance investment yields
