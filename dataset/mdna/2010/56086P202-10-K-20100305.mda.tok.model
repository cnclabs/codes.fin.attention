item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview makemusic s mission is to develop and market solutions that transform how music is composed  taught  learned and performed 
this is accomplished by providing integrated technology  content and web services to enhance and expand how music is taught  learned and prepared for performance 
providing music education content developers with a technology enriched publishing platform that leverages their copyrighted assets while simultaneously increasing the content and value of the smartmusic library 
offering software solutions for engraving and electronically distributing sheet music 
makemusic develops and markets two product lines  smartmusic learning software for band  jazz ensemble  orchestra and voice and finale music notation software 
we believe these innovative products reinforce each other s features and competitiveness and will allow us to continue to achieve positive operating results 
the well established finale family of music notation software products provides a solid base business that serves a large customer base and generates consistent revenue through sales of new products  annual upgrades and trade up campaigns 
music notation software is a niche business with limited growth opportunity since only a small percentage of musicians ever notate music 
our fiscal year resulted in continued sales growth for makemusic and overall  an increase over net revenue was achieved 
smartmusic revenue grew due to our subscription growth from  on december  to  on december  and a price increase implemented in july notation revenue increased overall  which we attribute primarily to sales of our finale notepad product that we began charging for in october  and stronger direct sales of finale 
gross margin percentages were comparable at in both and operating expenses increased in  primarily due to increased business systems expenses as a result of increased staffing and expansion of our systems infrastructure to support our anticipated smartmusic growth  and prior years sales tax expense from customers in certain states 
our net income before taxes in was  compared to  in additionally  we reported a significant tax benefit provision in this tax benefit resulted primarily from an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by  that represented management s revised estimate of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of the factors mentioned  we reported net income of approximately  in compared to net income of  in we believe our greatest growth potential lies with smartmusic  a subscription based product directed toward the very large and constantly renewing market of music students and their teachers 
smartmusic combines a software application  a library of thousands of music titles and skill development exercises and a web service to provide students with a compelling experience and teachers with the realistic means to document the progress of every student 
smartmusic software enhances and transforms the hours spent practicing by putting students inside a professional band or orchestra so that they can hear how the music is supposed to be performed and how their part fits in 
this makes practicing much more engaging  causing students to practice longer and more often 
smartmusic provides access to an ever increasing library of band  jazz ensemble and orchestra literature 
each title includes individual part assignments authored by respected educators  thereby providing music teachers with a time saving solution for preparing selections for their next performance 
smartmusic also offers a rich variety of effective practice tools that make practice time more efficient and productive 
the combination of making practice time more engaging and productive leads to rapid student skill development  increased student confidence  higher student retention  and stronger music programs 
smartmusic gradebook formerly smartmusic impact is a web based grade book that is included with each teacher subscription designed to manage student assignments  grades  and recordings while documenting the progress 
table of contents of each student and assessing student achievement 
this provides music educators and students with exciting new possibilities to assist in developing strong music programs and complying with accountability requirements 
smartmusic gradebook enables teachers to easily send assignments to each of their students 
students complete the assignment on their home computer provided that they have a smartmusic subscription  or on a school computer equipped with smartmusic 
submitted assignments are automatically graded and posted in the teacher s smartmusic gradebook thereby providing teachers with the visible means for measuring student achievement 
our sales organization focuses on direct school district sales aimed at the  schools who match our ideal demographic profile 
site licenses are sold that provide discounts for volume purchases 
in june  we slightly modified the definition of our smartmusic site licenses 
in order to continue to qualify for the volume purchase discount  a purchasing entity must have purchased or more subscriptions upon the one year anniversary of the site license agreement date 
if the entity did not achieve the subscription level  it no longer qualifies for the discount and we do not include the site license in our reported totals 
the effect of these changes was a slight reduction  but more accurate count of the monthly total site license numbers 
the updated smartmusic monthly site license totals are shown in the smartmusic metrics table below 
in addition to tracking the total number of subscriptions  we track the number of teachers who use smartmusic gradebook and the number of those teachers who are using smartmusic gradebook to deliver and manage student assignments to fifty students or more formerly known as impact teachers  now gradebook teachers 
as of december   we reported gradebook teachers compared to gradebook teachers as of december  the following table illustrates our quarterly smartmusic metrics dec mar jun sep dec total subscriptions educator accounts educators who have issued assignments gradebook teachers site licenses site license educator subscriptions annual statistics that restart on july of each year reflecting the start of the school year cycle the smartmusic target business model is to have music educators increase their use of smartmusic gradebook to set up their classes  enroll students and issue assignments  which we believe would result in an increase in student subscriptions 
as stated above   or  of the teachers who have purchased smartmusic have utilized smartmusic gradebook  and those teachers have  students receiving smartmusic assignments 
we are focusing on high level strategic sales and marketing initiatives to provide enhanced smartmusic subscriptions sales momentum 
during the third quarter of  we partnered with web marketing consultants to expand our social media and general web presence and in september  we hired a senior vice president of marketing to enhance our marketing efforts 
to accelerate the adoption of this target business model and address the lower than expected subscription rates in  in the first quarter of  we hired a sales director and increased the focus of our direct sales force on existing smartmusic teachers that have not yet utilized gradebook in their curriculum 
in addition  our development efforts are focused on improving and simplifying the smartmusic purchase processes  gradebook class set up  student enrollment and smartmusic assignments 
the overall objective is to make these processes easy and intuitive for both teachers and students 
these product enhancements were included in smartmusic  which was released on july  as a result of the increased focus of our direct sales force and the product enhancements  site license educator subscriptions increased from  at december  to  at december  during the third quarter of  we engaged a third party user interface design firm to assist in making the smartmusic and gradebook experience more intuitive  engaging  rewarding and social 
we believe this will result in faster growth of new subscribers and improved retention rates and the enhancements will be included in our next 
table of contents product release scheduled in additionally  we anticipate releasing popular solo literature in our smartmusic repertoire that will be focused on student fun and making practice more enjoyable 
we believe this will contribute to improving student subscription renewals and creating a more provocative value proposition for students and parents 
during the second quarter of  we completed research that identified the universe of schools matching the ideal smartmusic profile 
the profile was determined by evaluating our existing customer base and determining the demographic profile of the schools that have fully adopted smartmusic in their music programs 
the total number of schools which matched the profile was approximately  representing of schools with instrumental music programs 
to allow for targeted marketing and sales efforts to these profile schools  we have integrated this data into our customer relationship management system crm and are utilizing information associated with the current federal stimulus program in our marketing and sales initiatives 
in the third quarter of  we began tracking new versus renewed smartmusic subscriptions 
the following table illustrates the net new smartmusic subscription data for the quarters ended september   december   march   june   september  and december  quarterly beginning renewed quarter end net new quarter end date subscriptions new subscriptions subscriptions renewal rate subscriptions ended subscriptions subscriptions we define renewed subscriptions as those subscriptions that customers purchase within the two month period after their prior subscription ended 
because of changes to the start of school from year to year as well as fluctuations in the date that music teachers implement their curriculum  we commonly see subscribers that have a delay of up to two months in renewing their subscription 
as a result  we believe that using the above definition of a renewal more accurately reflects the renewal rate for smartmusic subscriptions 
we have achieved positive cash flow from operations for the last five years  including the most recent year ended december  our quarterly results will fluctuate as a result of the cyclicality of the education market 
due to current economic conditions and concerns over school budgets  we remain cautious regarding our future financial projections 
however  with increased revenues and  in particular  the growth in smartmusic subscriptions  plus improvements in operational efficiency over the last few years and the establishment of contingency plans to be implemented if our revenue and cash flow objectives are not met  we feel that we can continue to achieve positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months 
in  we began reporting results of operations by two unique reportable segments  notation and smartmusic 
this change was made to provide enhanced decision making capabilities relating to investments in our products 
historically  net revenue has been reported separately for these two product lines 
however  direct and operating costs had not been previously assessed or reported by segment 
therefore  prior year comparative costs are not available and operating costs by segment are not discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for further information on segment reporting  refer to note to the financial statements of this report 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical 
table of contents judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our distribution in domestic and international markets through independent dealers and distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts  however  none are greater than of the total revenue 
some international customers pay for the product prior to shipment  domestic dealers and distributors who do not prepay are granted payment terms and credit limits based on credit checks and account history 
we have successfully done business with most of our dealers and distributors for many years 
during fiscal year ended december   we had one distributor that ceased operations and closed its business resulting in a write off of their uncollectible accounts receivable of  there were no significant uncollectible accounts in any sales directly to home users are prepaid and schools submit purchase orders for purchases 
makemusic records a monthly accrual for potential non payments  which has historically been sufficient to cover uncollected accounts 
financial conditions in international markets and economic conditions can change quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 
sales returns and allowance reserves 
smartmusic teacher subscriptions automatically renew at the end of their subscription period 
notices of renewal are sent to the teacher in advance and an invoice is sent upon the renewal date 
a reserve is booked for those subscriptions that automatically renew and are subsequently cancelled due to teacher relocation  teacher cancellation  or non payment of accounts 
the reserve represents the revenue recognized on unpaid invoices for smartmusic subscriptions which are more than days overdue and which have had no activity in the preceding three months 
the reserve is then evaluated quarterly to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
when a new version of finale is released  dealers and distributors retain the right to return any unsold versions of the prior release normally of total prior year sales in exchange for an equal number of units of the updated version of the product that is returned 
the history of these returns is tracked and revenue is deferred based on the expected return rate until the new product is released  at which time the product may be returned for credit provided the customer places an equivalent number of units order for the new version 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost method 
we record a provision to adjust slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market based on historical experience and current product demand 
the carrying value of inventory is evaluated at least quarterly and adjusted as needed 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence when the inventory is no longer used in products in their most current released version 
stock based compensation 
accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  formerly known as sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense we recognize for each option award 
there are several assumptions that we must make when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends payable  and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the options and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
capitalized software costs 
costs incurred in the development of software products are capitalized in accordance with asc  software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  formerly known as fas which requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when the detailed program design and all planning and testing activities are completed 
capitalization of computer software costs shall cease when a product is available for general release to customers 
we capitalize the costs of producing any new software product  which includes individual song titles to be included as repertoire with the smartmusic product 
the estimated economic life of smartmusic gradebook  whose capitalization and market introduction was completed in  has been established 
table of contents as five years 
this five year amortization period is consistent with the initial licensing term for the large ensemble titles available in smartmusic that have pre authored assignments for use by teachers within smartmusic gradebook 
similarly  upon release of a large ensemble song title into smartmusic  we amortize the related capitalized software costs over the estimated life of the song  not to exceed the five year licensing period 
a reserve is recorded for an estimate of song titles that will not be released 
annual development of notation products consists of maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to review our amortization period for capitalized software costs as considered necessary based upon any new information and information gained in our review of the net realizable value of unamortized costs 
post contract support 
we account for software maintenance in accordance with asc  software software revenue recognition  formerly aicpa sop which states that revenue for post contract support pcs may be recognized upon the initial sale when pcs is included with the initial license and the cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant 
however  the estimated related costs are accrued in the same period that the sales price is recognized 
we provide unlimited  free telephone  e mail  and on line technical support to our customers and  therefore  accrue an estimated cost of future support for our notation products in the period of sale 
impairment of goodwill 
we review goodwill for potential impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  formerly fas 
our impairment review is conducted at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we have assigned all of our goodwill to the notation reporting unit and compare the fair value of this reporting unit effective january  as computed primarily by applying a combination of income or market valuation approaches  to its book carrying value  including goodwill step 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step to arrive at an implied fair value of the goodwill  by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the reported value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates by us  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by reporting units  the risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method provided by asc  income taxes formerly fas 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we assess the likelihood that  and the extent to which  our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
if we increase or decrease a valuation allowance in a given period  then we must increase or decrease the tax provision in our statements of income 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  minnesota net operating loss carry forwards of  and research and development tax credits of  the losses and tax credits are carried forward for federal and state corporate income taxes and may be used to reduce future taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we remained uncertain on how economic conditions would impact our back to school selling cycle and annual financial results 
based upon our strong performance in the fourth quarter of  our operating results in recent years and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined in that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our valuation allowance by  representing the approximate estimated tax on three years of forecasted net income 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the balance of our deferred tax assets  as of december  we have maintained a valuation 
table of contents allowance of  as of december   we had established a valuation allowance offsetting all of our deferred tax assets 
should the remaining  valuation allowance be reversed in the future  a liability of  would have to be established for uncertain tax positions 
as required by asc  income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
in addition  future utilization of nol carry forwards is subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
the acquisition of additional shares by a greater than shareholder in january resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol s in the future may be limited 
results of operations the following table summarizes key operating information for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands notation revenue smartmusic revenue other revenue net revenue cost of revenues gross profit percentage of net sales development selling and marketing general administrative total operating expenses operating income other income net income before taxes income tax expense benefit net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased from  in to  in notation revenue increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  notation revenue increased in due to sales of finale notepad  which we began charging for in october  and stronger direct sales of our finale academic products and downloads offset by reductions in our channel sales 
in addition  included revenue from a  finale site license  whereas there was no comparable sale in smartmusic revenue increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue reflects the continued growth of the smartmusic product that was originally launched in and the smartmusic gradebook product that was released in it also reflects the expansion of our smartmusic site license program which encourages school district deployment of smartmusic student subscriptions and our direct sales force which focuses on district level sales 
as of december   there were site licenses for smartmusic with average subscriptions per license of smartmusic is sold to schools  students and music organization members on a subscription basis 
revenue for these subscriptions is recognized over the life of the subscription which is typically months 
total earned smartmusic subscription revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the total number of subscriptions as well as a price increase in july when teacher subscriptions increased from to and student subscriptions increased from to total unearned smartmusic subscription revenue deferred revenue was  as of december   an increase of  or  over the balance at december  deferred smartmusic revenue represents the future revenue to be recorded on current subscriptions 
smartmusic has shown sustained growth since its launch 
as of december    schools have purchased smartmusic  an increase of over the  schools that had purchased it as of december  total smartmusic subscriptions as of december  numbered  representing a net gain of  or  over the december  subscription count of  smartmusic gradebook is a web based service that is designed to manage student assignments  recordings and grades while documenting the progress of each student and assessing student achievement 
we track the number of teachers who use smartmusic gradebook and the number of those teachers who are using smartmusic gradebook to deliver and manage student assignments to or more students formerly known as impact teachers  now gradebook teachers 
as of december   we had gradebook teachers compared to gradebook teachers as of december  this is an annual statistic  counting only teachers who have issued assignments to or more students during a school fiscal year 
the number of gradebook teachers restarts at zero on july of each year to correspond with the start of the school year 
many smartmusic customers  especially new customers  also purchase accessories primarily microphones and foot pedals that are used with the software 
revenue for the sales of accessories  included in the smartmusic revenue category  for the year ended december  was  which was comparable to revenue of  for smartmusic accessories for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased by  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   due to the increase in revenue 
cost of revenue includes product costs  royalties paid to publishers  amortization of capitalized software development costs for repertoire and smartmusic gradebook software development costs  shipping  and credit card fees 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for each of the years ended december  and development expense 
development expenses increased  from  in to  in development expenses consist primarily of internal payroll  payments to independent contractors and related expenses for the development and maintenance of our finale notation  smartmusic and smartmusic gradebook products  as well as non capitalized smartmusic repertoire development  business systems  and quality 
table of contents assurance costs 
personnel and contract labor costs increased in compared to due to staff increases that management believes were necessary in order to achieve numerous product development goals related to the simplification of smartmusic user interface  enrollment  and purchase processes 
additionally  we engaged a user interface design firm to make the smartmusic and gradebook experience more intuitive  engaging  rewarding  and social and incurred ongoing expenses related to our infrastructure expansion that we completed in june  we anticipate generally comparable development expenses in the future 
we released new smartmusic large ensemble band  jazz ensemble  and orchestra titles with pre authored assignments in  compared to new titles in additionally  we released fun titles and other solo titles in there were no new solo titles added in net content development expenditures of  in and  in related to this additional smartmusic repertoire have been capitalized and are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of marketing  advertising and promotion expenses  business development and customer service activities  and payroll 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from  in to  in this decrease of  or  is primarily due to less spending on direct marketing initiatives and tradeshow activities offset by cost relating to the departure of our chief marketing officer in the second quarter of and hiring of our education sales director in the first quarter of we are focusing on a higher level of strategic marketing initiatives to ensure continued smartmusic subscriptions sales momentum and expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as a result 
we partnered with web marketing consultants to expand our social media and general web presence and in the third quarter of  we hired a senior vice president of marketing 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  facility costs  amortization of certain intangible assets with finite lives  bad debt  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  in to  in general and administrative costs increased primarily as a result of sales tax expense and standard annual increases in health insurance premiums  partially offset by decreases in payroll and personnel expenses as a result of the departure of our founder and former co chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of sales tax expense of  relates to prior periods taxes that had not been collected from our customers in certain states 
we expect general and administrative expenses to moderately decrease in the future due to the one time expenses relating to past sales tax 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to  in net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income was due to lower interest rates during the year 
income tax 
we recorded a net income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results in the most recent fiscal years and our assessment of expected future profitability and the overall prospects for our business 
as of december   a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on all the available evidence  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance by approximately  as of december  we have a remaining valuation allowance of approximately  against net deferred tax assets 
in the event the valuation allowance on the net operating losses expiring in is reversed we will need to recognize a reserve for uncertain tax positions of  significant management judgment is required to determine when  in the future  the realization of our net deferred tax assets will become more likely than not 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available based on actual and forecasted operating results 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flow from operating activities was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  the improvements in cash provided by operating activities are primarily a result of the increase in net income  reduction 
table of contents in inventory levels  and changes in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
actual cash used in operations is typically highest in the first and second quarter  with the third and fourth quarters normally producing positive operating cash flow 
these quarterly fluctuations are created by the notation product release cycle and the cyclical impact of sales to schools related to the school year fiscal calendar 
management expects to achieve positive annual cash flow in the foreseeable future but not necessarily in each quarter 
if we do not meet our anticipated revenue levels due to economic conditions  a significantly later than anticipated product release  or a decrease in demand for our products  management has identified contingency plans and is committed to expense reductions as necessary to ensure adequate cash levels 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for investment in product development 
cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  this  reduction was due to our decrease in repertoire development spending 
our investment in was significant as we developed our smartmusic large ensemble library of titles and we reduced spending in through department efficiencies and a reduction in titles released 
current year expenditures were  for purchases of property and equipment and  for capitalization of repertoire development 
we expect our investment activity to be generally comparable in the future 
cash used in financing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to cash provided of  in the year ended december  this change is primarily due to stock option and warrant exercise activity 
during   was received for the exercise of stock options and warrants  versus  received in the majority of our outstanding warrants expired on february  in addition  during  one individual exercised stock options under multiple cashless exercises and  as a result  cash proceeds of  from the redemption were used to pay taxes withheld 
there were no cashless stock option exercises in we do not expect any significant cash to be provided by the exercise of stock options or warrants in due to our current stock price and options outstanding 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and as of december   the balance was  contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consist of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable capital and operating leases as follows capital lease operating lease total lease obligations obligations obligations in thousands thereafter from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december  no such losses existed
