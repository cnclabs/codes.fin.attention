risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high performance  energy efficient lighting systems  controls and related services 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of high intensity fluorescent  or hif  lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
we typically sell our hif lighting systems in replacement of our customers existing high intensity discharge  or hid  fixtures 
we call this replacement process a retrofit 
we frequently engage our customer s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services 
we also sell our hif lighting systems on a wholesale basis  principally to electrical contractors and value added resellers to sell to their own customer bases 
we have sold and installed more than  of our hif lighting systems in over  facilities from december  through march  we have sold our products to fortune companies  many of which have installed our hif lighting systems in multiple facilities 
our top direct customers by revenue in fiscal included coca cola enterprises inc  us foodservice  sysco corp  ball corporation  millercoors and pepsico  inc and its affiliates 
our fiscal year ends on march we call our fiscal years which ended on march   and  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we call our current fiscal year  which will end on march   fiscal 
our fiscal first quarter ends on june  our fiscal second quarter ends on september  our fiscal third quarter ends on december and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on march because of the current recessed state of the global economy  especially as it has affected capital equipment manufacturers  our fiscal results continued to be impacted by lengthened customer sales cycles and sluggish customer capital spending 
to address these conditions  we implemented million of annualized cost reductions during the first quarter of fiscal these cost containment initiatives included reductions related to headcount  work hours and discretionary spending and began to show results in the second half of fiscal in response to the constraints on our customers capital spending budgets  we have more aggressively promoted the advantages to our customers of purchasing our energy management systems through our ovpp finance program as an alternative to purchasing our systems for cash 
we expect that the number of customers who choose to purchase our systems by using our ovpp financing program to continue to increase in future periods 
while our ovpp program creates a recurring revenue stream over the term of the annually renewable ovpp contract  it results in mis match between the timing of our recognition of revenues and expenses 
this consequence has negatively impacted our near term revenue and net income  and will likely continue to do so 
all of our selling and marketing expenses and most of our administrative expenses related to new ovpp contracts are expensed up front as incurred  while the related ovpp contract revenue is recognized on a monthly basis over the life of the contract 
our management evaluates the impact of our ovpp contracts on our financial statements by discounting the future earnings potential of our ovpp contracts at our weighted average cost of capital rate of  assuming that our ovpp customers will exercise all renewal periods through the end of their contract term 
we believe that this non gaap analysis helps to provide additional clarity on the financial impact to us of the deferral of revenues and net income from these contracts and  for comparative purposes  helps to eliminate the mis matching of revenues and expenses that occurs under generally accepted accounting principles as a result of our ovpp program 
for fiscal  we have evaluated the impact of the million of ovpp contract bookings during fiscal and determined that the discounted future earnings potential would have provided us with an additional of earnings per share for fiscal  which would have reduced our total loss to per share 
we expect this trend to continue in fiscal in august  we created orion engineered systems  formerly known as orion technology ventures  a new operating division which has been offering our customers additional alternative renewable energy systems 
in fiscal  we sold and installed three solar photovoltaic electricity generating projects  completing our test analysis on two of the three in the third quarter  and executed our first cash sale and our first ppa as a result of the successful testing of these systems 
we expect the installation and customer acceptance of the third system to be completed during our fiscal first quarter 
these projects are helping us answer technological  installation and commercial feasibility questions before determining how this technology may fit into our overall business plan 
in the near term  we do not anticipate revenue contributions from these projects to be significant 

table of contents despite near term economic challenges  we remain optimistic about our long term financial performance 
our long term optimism is based upon the considerable size of the existing market opportunity for lighting retrofits  the continued development of our new products and product enhancements  the opportunity for our participation in the replacement part aftermarket and the increasing national recognition of the importance of environmental stewardship  including the recent state of wisconsin legislation recognizing our solar apollo light pipe as a renewable product offering and qualifying it for incentives currently offered to other renewable technologies 
revenue and expense components revenue 
we sell our energy management products and services directly to commercial and industrial customers  and indirectly to end users through wholesale sales to electrical contractors and value added resellers 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of hif lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
while our services include comprehensive site assessment  site field verification  utility incentive and government subsidy management  engineering design  project management  installation and recycling in connection with our retrofit installations  we separately recognize service revenue only for our installation and recycling services 
except for our installation and recycling services  all other services are completed prior to product shipment and revenue from such services is included in product revenue because evidence of fair value for these services does not exist 
in fiscal  we increased our efforts to expand our value added reseller channel with the development of a partner standard operating procedural kit  marketing through mass mailings  participating in national trade organizations and providing training to channel partners on our sales methodologies 
these wholesale channels accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  which was an increase from the of total revenues contributed in fiscal we believe that this growth trend in our wholesale mix of total revenues will continue in fiscal in october  we introduced to the market a financing program called the orion virtual power plant  or ovpp  or orion throughput agreement  or ota  for our customers purchase of our energy management systems without an up front capital outlay 
ovpp and ota are interchangeable terms 
the ovpp is structured as a supply agreement in which we receive monthly rental payments over the life of the contract  typically months  with an annual renewable agreement with a maximum term between two and five years 
this program creates an ongoing recurring revenue stream  but reduces near term revenues as the payments are recognized as revenue on a monthly basis over the life of the contract versus upfront upon product shipment or project completion 
however  we do retain the option to sell the payment stream to a third party finance company  as we have done under the terms of our ota financing program  in which case the revenue is recognized at the net present value of the total future payments from the finance company upon completion of the sale transaction 
the ovpp program was established to assist customers who are interested in purchasing our energy management systems but who have capital expenditure budget limitations 
for fiscal  we recognized  of revenue from completed ovpp contracts 
for fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ovpp contracts  including million from the sale of contracts to a third party finance company 
as of march   we had signed customers to ovpp contracts representing future gross revenue streams of million 
in the future  we expect an increase in the volume of ovpp contracts as our customers take advantage of our value proposition without incurring up front capital cost 
our gross margins on ovpp revenues are similar to gross margins achieved on cash sales 
other than ovpp sales  we recognize revenue on product only sales at the time of shipment 
for projects consisting of multiple elements of revenue  such as a combination of product sales and services  we separate the project into separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values for revenue recognition purposes 
additionally  the deferral of revenue on a delivered element may be required if such revenue is contingent upon the delivery of the remaining undelivered elements 
we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment on product sales and on services completed prior to product shipment 
we recognize revenue associated with services provided after product shipment  based on their fair value  when the services are completed and customer acceptance has been received 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi facility roll out projects 
our top customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal while no customers accounted for more than of revenue in either fiscal and fiscal if large retrofit and roll out projects become a greater component of our total revenue  we may experience more customer concentration in given periods 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in sales volume to  any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue in any given period and may result in significant annual and quarterly revenue variations 

table of contents our level of total revenue for any given period is dependent upon a number of factors  including i the demand for our products and systems  including our ovpp program and any new products  applications and services that we may introduce through our new orion engineered systems division  ii the number and timing of large retrofit and multi facility retrofit  or roll out  projects  iii the level of our wholesale sales  iv our ability to realize revenue from our services and our ovpp program  including whether we decide to retain or resell the expected future cash flows under our ovpp program and the relative timing of the resultant revenue recognition  v market conditions  vi our execution of our sales process  vii our ability to compete in a highly competitive market and our ability to respond successfully to market competition  viii the selling price of our products and services  ix changes in capital investment levels by our customers and prospects  and x customer sales cycles 
as a result  our total revenue may be subject to quarterly variations and our total revenue for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of future results 
bookings 
although bookings is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles  as the volume of our ovpp business is expected to continue to increase and because of the deferred revenue recognition of our retained ovpp projects  we believe bookings provides our management and investors with an informative measure of our relative order activity for any particular period 
we define bookings as the total contractual value of all firm purchase orders received for our products and services and the gross revenue streams for all ovpp contracts upon the execution of the contract 
we define bookings for ppa agreements as the discounted value of revenues from energy generation over the life of the agreement along with the discounted value of revenues for renewable energy credits rec for as long as the rec programs are currently defined to be in existence with the governing body 
for fiscal  total bookings were million  which included million of future revenue streams associated with ovpp contracts 
for fiscal  total bookings were million  which included million of future revenue streams associated with ovpp contracts and million of discounted revenue streams from ppa contracts 
backlog 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders received for our lighting products and services where delivery of product or completion of services has not yet occurred as of the end of any particular reporting period 
such orders must be evidenced by a signed proposal acceptance or purchase order from the customer 
our backlog does not include ovpp contracts  ppa contracts or national contracts that have been negotiated  but we have not yet received a purchase order for the specific location 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million 
we generally expect this level of firm purchase order backlog to be converted into revenue within the following quarter 
principally as a result of the continued lengthening of our customer s purchasing decisions because of current recessed economic conditions and related factors  the continued shortening of our installation cycles and the number of projects sold through national and ovpp contracts  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenue recognized in future periods 
cost of revenue 
our total cost of revenue consists of costs for i raw materials  including sheet  coiled and specialty reflective aluminum  ii electrical components  including ballasts  power supplies and lamps  iii wages and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  for our fabricating  coating  assembly  logistics and project installation service organizations  iv manufacturing facilities  including depreciation on our manufacturing facilities and equipment  taxes  insurance and utilities  v warranty expenses  vi installation and integration  and vii shipping and handling 
our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuations  which we attempt to mitigate with forward fixed price  minimum quantity purchase commitments with our suppliers 
we also purchase many of our electrical components through forward purchase contracts 
we buy most of our specialty reflective aluminum from a single supplier  and most of our ballast and lamp components from a single supplier  although we believe we could obtain sufficient quantities of these raw materials and components on a price and quality competitive basis from other suppliers if necessary 
purchases from our current primary supplier of ballast and lamp components constituted and of our total cost of revenue for fiscal and fiscal our cost of revenue from ovpp projects is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet with the related costs amortized monthly over the life of the asset 
our production labor force is non union and  as a result  our production labor costs have been relatively stable 
we have been expanding our network of qualified third party installers to realize efficiencies in the installation process 
toward the end of fiscal  we began to vertically integrate some of our processes performed at outside suppliers to help us better manage delivery lead time  control process quality and inventory supply 
we installed a coating line and acquired production fabrication equipment 
each of these production items provides us with additional capacity to continue to support our potential future revenue growth 
we expect that these processes will help to reduce overall unit costs as the equipment becomes more fully utilized 
during fiscal  we reengineered our manufacturing production product flow  consolidating product assembly stations  eliminating redundant material handling activities and improving production efficiencies 
these design improvements helped reduce manufacturing direct and indirect labor costs 

table of contents gross margin 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be  affected by the relative levels of our total revenue and our total cost of revenue  and as a result  our gross profit may be subject to quarterly variation 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue  or gross margin  is affected by a number of factors  including i our mix of large retrofit and multi facility roll out projects with national accounts  ii the level of our wholesale sales  iii our realization rate on our billable services  iv our project pricing  v our level of warranty claims  vi our level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment and related absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs  vii our level of efficiencies in our manufacturing operations  and viii our level of efficiencies from our subcontracted installation service providers 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of i general and administrative expenses  ii sales and marketing expenses  and iii research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are our largest operating expense 
up front costs related to our ovpp business  including most related sales activities and contract administration costs  are expensed as incurred resulting in a mis match of operating expense recognition and the related revenue recognition from ovpp contracts 
this mis match of ovpp revenue and expense recognition reduces near term profitability as revenue and gross profit are recorded under gaap in future periods 
while we have recently focused on reducing our personnel costs and headcount in certain functional areas  we do nonetheless believe that future opportunities within our business remain strong 
as a result  we may choose to continue to selectively add to our sales  marketing and research and development staff based upon opportunities that may arise 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  ii public company costs  including investor relations and audit  iii occupancy expenses  iv professional services fees  v technology related costs and amortization  and vi corporate related travel 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our sales and marketing organization  ii internal and external sales commissions and bonuses  iii travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses associated with our selling efforts  iv marketing programs  v pre sales costs  and vi other related overhead 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our engineering organization  ii payments to consultants  iii the design and development of new energy management products and enhancements to our existing energy management system  iv quality assurance and testing  and v other related overhead 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we have incurred increased general and administrative expenses in connection with our becoming a public company  including increased accounting  audit  investor relations  legal and support services and sarbanes oxley compliance fees and expenses 
in fiscal  our operating expenses increased as a result of the completion of our new technology center and the related building occupancy costs 
we expense all pre sale costs incurred in connection with our sales process prior to obtaining a purchase order 
these pre sale costs may reduce our net income in a given period prior to recognizing any corresponding revenue 
we also intend to continue to invest in our research and development of new and enhanced energy management products and services 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of our stock option awards granted over their related vesting period using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as a result of prior option grants  including option grants in fiscal  we expect to recognize an additional million of stock based compensation over a weighted average period of approximately seven years 
these charges have been  and will continue to be  allocated to cost of product revenue  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses based on the departments in which the personnel receiving such awards have primary responsibility 
a substantial majority of these charges have been  and likely will continue to be  allocated to general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
interest expense 
our interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding borrowings under long term debt obligations described under liquidity and capital resources indebtedness below  including the amortization of previously incurred financing costs 
we amortize deferred financing costs to interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument  ranging from six to fifteen years 

table of contents dividend and interest income 
our dividend income consisted of dividends paid on preferred shares that we acquired in july the terms of these preferred shares provided for annual dividend payments to us of million 
we sold the preferred shares back to the issuer in june and all dividends accrued were paid upon sale 
we also report interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for fiscal  our interest income increased as a result of our investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short term  interest bearing  money market funds  bank certificate of deposits and investment grade securities 
for fiscal  our interest income declined as a result of the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and declining market rates 
income taxes 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax purposes of compensation expenses that were associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and state tax credit carryforwards of  which is net of the valuation allowance of  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of most of these assets and has reserved for an allowance due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of the state tax credits due to the carryforwards period 
these federal and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards are available  subject to the discussion in the following paragraph  to offset future taxable income and  if not utilized  will begin to expire in varying amounts between and generally  a change of more than in the ownership of a company s stock  by value  over a three year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
an ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change 
in fiscal and prior to our ipo  past issuances and transfers of stock caused an ownership change for certain tax purposes 
when certain ownership changes occur  tax laws require that a calculation be made to establish a limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards created in periods prior to such ownership change 
for fiscal year  utilization of our federal loss carryforwards was limited to million 
there was no limitation that occurred for fiscal or accretion of preferred stock and preferred stock dividends 
our accretion of redeemable preferred stock and preferred stock dividends consisted of accumulated unpaid dividends on our series a and series c preferred stock during the periods that such shares were outstanding 
the terms of our series c preferred stock provided for a per annum cumulative dividend unless we completed a qualified initial public offering or sale 
as a result  the carrying amount of our series c preferred stock were increased each period to reflect the accretion of accumulated unpaid dividends 
the obligation to pay these accumulated unpaid dividends was extinguished upon conversion of the series c preferred stock because our ipo constituted a qualified initial public offering under the terms of our series c preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock automatically converted into common stock upon closing of our ipo  and the carrying amount of our series c preferred stock  along with accumulated unpaid dividends  was credited to additional paid in capital at that time 
our series a preferred stock was issued beginning in fiscal and provided for a per annum cumulative dividend 
our series a preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock in fiscal and fiscal as described under conversion of preferred stock 
conversion of preferred stock 
in fiscal  we offered our holders of then outstanding series a preferred stock the opportunity to convert each of their series a preferred shares  together with the accumulated unpaid dividends thereon and their other rights and preferences related thereto  into three shares of our common stock 
since the series a preferred shareholders had the existing right to convert each of their series a preferred shares into two shares of common stock  we determined that the increase in the conversion ratio from two to three shares of common stock was an inducement offer 
as a result  we accounted for the value of the change in this conversion ratio as an increase to additional paid in capital and a charge to our accumulated deficit at the time of conversion 
in fiscal   outstanding series a preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock 
the remaining  outstanding series a preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock on march  the premium amount recorded for the inducement  calculated using the number of additional common shares offered multiplied by the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the time of conversion  was million for fiscal and  for fiscal participation rights of preferred stock in undistributed earnings 
because all series of our preferred stock participate in all undistributed earnings with the common stock  we allocated earnings to the common shareholders and participating preferred shareholders under the two class method as required under the provisions of asc  earnings per share 
the two class method is an earnings allocation method under which basic net income per share is calculated for our common stock and participating preferred stock considering both accrued preferred stock dividends and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the year 
because our participating preferred stock was not contractually required to share in our losses  in applying the two class method to compute basic net income per common share  we did not make any allocation to our preferred stock if a net loss existed or if an undistributed net loss resulted from reducing net income by the accrued preferred stock dividends 
all of our preferred stock was converted automatically into common stock on a one for one basis upon the closing of our ipo and we are no longer required to allocate any undistributed earnings to our preferred shareholders 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the line items of our consolidated statements of operations on an absolute dollar basis and as a relative percentage of our total revenue for each applicable period  together with the relative percentage change in such line item between applicable comparable periods set forth below fiscal year ended march  dollars in thousands of of of amount revenue amount revenue change amount revenue change product revenue service revenue total revenue cost of product revenue cost of service revenue total cost of revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses income loss from operations nm interest expense extinguishment of debt dividend and interest income income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss accretion of redeemable preferred stock and preferred stock dividends participation rights of preferred stock in undistributed earnings net income loss attributable to common shareholders nm not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal bookings 
total bookings increased from million  which included million of future revenue streams associated with ovpp contracts  for fiscal to million  which included million of future revenue streams associated with ovpp contracts and million of discounted revenue streams from ppa contracts  for fiscal  an increase of million or 
revenue 
product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was a result of decreased sales of our hif lighting systems and an increase in the number of projects sold under our ovpp financing terms  which reduced revenue in the near term  but provides recurring revenue into future fiscal periods 
service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in service revenue was a result of the decreased sales of our hif lighting systems and the continued percentage increase of total revenues to our wholesale channels where services are not provided 
we believe that our fiscal revenues continued to be impacted by a general conservatism in the marketplace concerning capital spending and purchase decisions due to continuing adverse economic and credit market conditions 
in the second half of fiscal  we realized a slight improvement in our order volumes in relation to the first half of our fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of product revenue due to the sale of a portion of our ovpp finance contracts to a third party equipment finance company 
we believe that the significant increase in our ovpp finance bookings  million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  has helped to address capital spending constraints by providing an alternative to the up front capital requirements of a cash purchase 
accordingly  we believe that our ovpp financed business will continue to increase during fiscal  accounting for approximately to of our anticipated total bookings 
this increase in our financed business and the deferral of revenue recognition into future periods  may result in reduced product revenues in the near term 

table of contents cost of revenue and gross margin 
our cost of product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
our cost of service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
total gross margin remained substantially unchanged at for fiscal and for fiscal during fiscal  we maintained improvements in our product gross margins  in spite of the volume decline  resulting from our efforts to reengineer our assembly processes  including the implementation of cell manufacturing stations  a reduction in headcount and a reduction in work hours  and reductions in discretionary spending and premium costs  like overtime 
operating expenses general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was a result of i million increase for occupancy costs related to the completion of our new technology center  including approximately million for one time start up charges  ii million for legal costs related to the defense and preliminary settlement of our securities class action litigation  iii million in severance compensation costs and headcount additions related to staff support in information technology and executive support staff in human resources and administrative functions  iv million in costs related to the write down of a long term note receivable and bad debt charges on aged accounts receivable  and v million as a result of a one time gain on asset disposal in the fiscal that did not recur in fiscal these cost increases were partially offset by million in decreased compensation costs resulting from headcount reductions and other discretionary spending reductions 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of the mismatch of expenses incurred to sell and market the growth in our ovpp finance program and compensation and benefit costs for additional sales and marketing personnel 
we increased our sales and marketing headcount to further develop opportunities for our exterior lighting products within the utility and governmental markets  expanded sales and sales support personnel dedicated to our in market sales programs and added technical expertise for our wireless controls product lines and our renewable technology initiatives 
research and development 
our research and development expenses were substantially unchanged in fiscal from fiscal  at approximately million 
expenses incurred in fiscal related to compensation costs for the development and support of new products  depreciation expenses for lab and research equipment and testing costs related to our new wireless controls  exterior lighting and led product initiatives 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense was due to the elimination of capitalized interest resulting from the completion of our corporate technology center 
for fiscal and fiscal  we capitalized  and  of interest for construction in progress  respectively 
extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal   of debt under equipment loans from our local government was forgiven related to our creation and retention of certain types and numbers of jobs at our manufacturing facility 
dividend and interest income 
our dividend and interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of declining market interest rates and the reduction in our cash balances year over year due to cash used to finance our ovpp programs and our investment in wireless control inventory components 
income taxes 
our income tax expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to the reduction in our taxable income 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to a benefit rate of for fiscal the change in our effective rate was due to a reduction of benefits for non deductible stock compensation expense from prior incentive stock options grants and the impact of an increase in our state valuation allowance reserve 
fiscal compared to fiscal bookings 
our fiscal bookings were million  including million of future revenue streams associated with ovpp contracts 
we do not have reliable bookings data for periods prior to fiscal revenue 
our fiscal product revenue of million decreased compared to our fiscal product revenue of million 
this decrease was a result of decreased capital spending and delayed purchase decisions within our customer base due to adverse economic and credit market conditions 
our fiscal service revenue of million decreased compared to our fiscal service revenue of million 
this decrease was a result of our increased revenues to our wholesale channels where services are not provided and decreased capital spending and delayed purchase decisions within our direct customer base 

table of contents cost of revenue 
our fiscal cost of product revenue of million increased compared to our fiscal cost of product revenue of million 
this increase was a result of new equipment and operating costs for product coating and fabrication  and additional assembly labor personnel costs  including stock compensation expense  for the manufacturing production of our enclosure product lines and wet rated fixtures 
these enclosure products are more labor intensive than our standard compact modular products 
our fiscal cost of service revenue of million decreased compared to our fiscal cost of service revenue of million 
this decrease was a result of our increased revenues to our wholesale channels where services are not provided 
gross margin 
our fiscal gross profit of million decreased on an absolute dollar basis compared to our fiscal gross profit of million 
our fiscal gross margin percentage of decreased from our fiscal gross margin percentage of 
the decrease in both gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage was due to underabsorbed manufacturing capacity costs related to reduced product volumes  added costs for additional production capabilities in our coating and forming departments and additional costs for labor personnel  including overtime  to assemble and produce our enclosure and wet rated product lines 
operating expenses general and administrative 
our fiscal general and administrative expenses of million increased compared to our fiscal general and administrative expenses of million 
the increase was due to i compensation cost increases of million  including stock option compensation  related to additional staff support in our human resources  accounting  information technology and administrative functions  ii legal expenses of million resulting from our defense of our securities class action litigation  iii additional public company costs  including additional expenses for accounting  investor relations and legal services  and iv increased consulting costs for technology and for sarbanes oxley compliance 
these cost increases were offset by decreases in bonus compensation costs of million 
these decreases in bonus expense were due to million of one time bonus expense in fiscal related to the completion of our ipo and our incurring no expense in fiscal related to our executive bonus compensation plan compared with million in such expenses in fiscal sales and marketing 
our fiscal sales and marketing expense of million increased on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses of million 
this increase was a result of increased employee compensation expenses  including stock option compensation  of million resulting from our hiring of additional sales and sales support personnel and a million increase in marketing costs as a result of efforts to increase our brand awareness through direct mail into the wholesale channel and our participation in national trade shows 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in commission payments and employee bonus compensation of million as a result of our lower revenue volumes 
research and development 
our fiscal research and development expense of million increased compared to our fiscal research and development expense of million 
this increase was due to investment in the continued development of our wireless control product  technology and process improvements in our coating operation and sample and material costs for the development of new products 
interest expense 
our fiscal interest expense of million decreased compared to our fiscal interest expense of million 
this decrease was a result of a reduction in expense on our revolving line of credit due to minimal borrowing activity in fiscal  the conversion of our convertible debt into common stock as a result of the completion of our ipo and the subsequent elimination of million of interest recorded in fiscal and capitalization of million of interest expense in fiscal for construction related to our corporate technology center 
dividend and interest income 
our fiscal dividend and interest income of million increased compared to our fiscal dividend and interest income of million 
this increase was a result of the full year impact of interest income earned on the invested proceeds from our ipo completed in december income taxes 
our fiscal income tax expense of million decreased compared to our fiscal income tax expense of million due to our decreased pre tax income 
our fiscal effective income tax rate was compared to for our fiscal the increase in our effective rate was due to the impact of non deductible stock compensation expense related to prior issuances of incentive stock options 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the last eight fiscal quarters in the period ended march  i on an absolute dollar basis in thousands and ii as a percentage of total revenue for the applicable fiscal quarter

additionally  our quarterly revenues can be impacted by the mix of our bookings between cash sales and ota ovpp contracts  as ota ovpp revenues are deferred into future periods over the term of the agreements 
historically  our customers have tended to increase their purchases near the beginning or end of their capital budget cycles  which tend to correspond to the beginning or end of the calendar year 
as a result  we have in the past experienced lower relative total revenue in our fiscal first and second quarters and higher relative total revenue in our fiscal third quarter 
these seasonal fluctuations have been largely offset by our customers decisions to initiate multiple facility roll outs 
we expect that there may be future variations in our quarterly total revenue depending on our level of national account roll out projects and wholesale sales 
our results for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of results for other fiscal quarters or an entire fiscal year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview on december   we completed our initial public offering  or ipo 
net proceeds to us from our ipo were approximately million net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before the deduction of offering expenses 
we invested the net proceeds from our ipo in money market funds and short term government agency bonds 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts and bank certificates of deposits with maturities of less than days and an average yield of 
our short term investment account consists of a bank certificate of deposit in the amount of million with an expiration date of june and a yield of 
we currently have been using our cash on hand  including million during fiscal  to fund our investment of company owned equipment under our ota ovpp and ppa projects 
we expect that our volume of financed projects will continue to increase in the future and that the cash required to fund these projects will continue to increase as well 
we also recognize that our ability to grow revenues through these programs will continue to deplete our cash resources if we do not secure additional funding sources 
we are exploring potential financing alternatives to support the expected growth of our ota ovpp contract volumes 
the current recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our anticipated cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
as of march   we were in a strong financial position with million in cash and short term investments 
for that reason  we do not anticipate drawing on our million line of credit nor do we expect to use significant amounts of our cash balances for operating activities during fiscal our future working capital requirements thereafter will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue  our rate of ovpp and ota growth  our rate of investment into our financed sales programs  our introduction of new products and services and enhancements to our existing energy management system  the timing and extent of expansions of our sales force and other administrative and production personnel  the timing and extent of advertising and promotional campaigns  and our research and development activities 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended march  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows related to operating activities 
cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expenses  income taxes and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million used for working capital purposes and net loss adjusted non cash expenses of million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million 
the million increase in cash provided from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to improved collections of our accounts receivable 

table of contents cash flows related to investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures related to the completion of our new corporate technology center  operating and customer relationship software systems  a photovoltaic solar generated power system and for purchases of manufacturing equipment and tooling 
additionally  we invested million in equipment related to our ovpp and ppa finance programs and million for the development of our intellectual property 
we generated cash flow from investing activities of million from the sale of short term investments 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures in our new corporate technology center  operating software systems  improvements in our manufacturing facility and for purchases of equipment and tooling 
we also invested million in short term certificate of deposits and spent million for the purchase of intellectual property rights from an executive  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of an investment of million 
in fiscal  our principal cash investments were for purchases of processing equipment  construction costs for our new technology center and other improvements to our facility  short term government investment securities and continued development of our intellectual property 
cash flows related to financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this included proceeds of million received from stock option and warrant exercises  million for proceeds from long term debt and  for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash used in financing activities included million for debt principal payments and million used for common share repurchases 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the use of cash was due to million used for common share repurchases and million of debt principal payments  offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and million for the impact of deferred taxes on our stock based compensation 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this increase in cash provided was due to million of net proceeds from our initial public offering  million of gross proceeds raised from the issuance of our convertible notes  million from stock option and warrant exercises  million from shareholder note payments and million from debt proceeds  offset by payments on our line of credit of million and debt principal payments of million 
working capital our net working capital as of march  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our net working capital as of march  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our inventories have increased from our prior year by million due to an increase in the level of our wireless control inventories and an increase in ballast component inventories 
the vast majority of our wireless components are assembled overseas  require longer delivery lead times and supplies require deposit payments at time of purchase order 
we increased our inventory levels of ballasts due to concerns over supply availability resulting from extended lead times for product shipping out of asia 
we generally attempt to maintain a three month supply of on hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand  as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions 
recently  we increased our inventory levels of key electrical components to avoid shortages and customer service issues as a result of lengthening supply lead times and product availability issues 
our accounts receivables  inventory and payables may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase 
indebtedness on march   we entered into a credit agreement to replace a previous agreement between us and wells fargo bank  na the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that matures on august  the initial maximum aggregate amount of availability under the line of credit is million 
in december  we briefly drew million on the line of credit due to the timing of treasury repurchases and funds available in our operating account 
in may  we completed an amendment to the credit agreement  effective as of march   which formalized wells fargo s prior consent to our treasury repurchase program  increased the capital expenditures covenant for fiscal and revised certain financial covenants by adding a minimum requirement for unencumbered liquid assets  increasing the quarterly rolling net income requirement and modifying the merger and acquisition covenant exemption 
in december  we completed a second amendment to the credit agreement which formalized wells fargo s prior consent to our prior failure to meet our net earnings and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants  limited borrowings to a percentage of eligible money market funds held in a wells fargo account  revised certain financial covenants by removing the minimum requirement for unencumbered assets and removing the fixed charge coverage ratio  decreased the quarterly rolling net income requirement  removed the first lien security interest in all of our accounts receivable  general intangibles and inventory  and removed the second lien priority in all of our equipment and fixtures and reduced the fee rate of the unused amounts on the line of credit 
as of march  and  there was no outstanding balance due on the line of credit 
we must pay a fee of on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit and fees upon the issuance of each letter of credit equal to per annum of the principal amount thereof 

table of contents the credit agreement provides that we have the option to select the interest rate applicable to all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the line of credit either i at a fluctuating rate per annum below the prime rate in effect from time to time  or ii at a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be above libor 
interest is payable on the last day of each month 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants including minimum net income requirements and requirements that we maintain a net worth ratio at prescribed levels 
the credit agreement also contains certain restrictions on our ability to make capital or lease expenditures over prescribed limits  incur additional indebtedness  consolidate or merge  guarantee obligations of third parties  make loans or advances  declare or pay any dividend or distribution on our stock  redeem or repurchase shares of our stock  or pledge assets 
in addition to our line of credit  we also have other existing long term indebtedness and obligations under various debt instruments and capital lease obligations  including pursuant to a bank term note  a bank first mortgage  a debenture to a community development organization  a federal block grant loan  two city industrial revolving loans and various capital leases and equipment purchase notes 
as of march   the total amount of principal outstanding on these various obligations was million 
these obligations have varying maturity dates between and and bear interest at annual rates of between and 
the weighted average annual interest rate of such obligations as of march  was 
based on interest rates in effect as of march   we expect that our total debt service payments on such obligations for fiscal  including scheduled principal  lease and interest payments  but excluding any repayment of borrowings on our line of credit  will approximate million 
all of these obligations are subject to security interests on our assets 
several of these obligations have covenants  such as customary financial and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio  a minimum current ratio  quarterly rolling net income requirement  limitations on executive compensation and advances  limits on capital expenditures per year  limits on distributions  and restrictions on our ability to make loans  advances  extensions of credit  investments  capital contributions  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  guaranty obligations  merge or consolidate or undergo a change in control 
as of march   we were in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
capital spending we have made capital expenditures primarily for general corporate purposes for our corporate headquarters and technology center  production equipment and tooling and for information technology systems 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to incur approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal our capital expenditures will be used to complete our erp system  originally undertaken during fiscal  and which we consider critical to our operations  renewable energy related expenditures  new product development and for manufacturing and tooling improvements 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures primarily through our existing cash  equipment secured loans and leases  to the extent needed  or by using our available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of march  is set forth in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank debt obligations capital lease obligations cash interest payments on debt and capital leases operating lease obligations purchase order and cap ex commitments total reflects non cancellable purchase commitments in the amount of million for certain inventory items entered into in order to secure better pricing and ensure materials on hand and capital expenditure commitments in the amount of million for the completion of improvements to information technology systems 

table of contents the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include our unrecognized tax benefits which were million at march  we have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of any adjustments to these unrecognized benefits 
furthermore  we believe that any negative impact from future tax audits would result in a minimal cash liability due to our net operating loss carryforwards 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation our results from operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  the collectability of receivables  stock based compensation  warranty reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is recognized when products are shipped to a customer or when services are completed and acceptance provisions  if any  have been met 
in certain of our contracts  we provide multiple deliverables 
we record the revenue associated with each element of these arrangements based on its fair value  which is generally the price charged for the element when sold on a standalone basis 
since we contract with vendors for installation services to our customers  which includes recycling of old fixtures  we determine the fair value of our installation services based on negotiated pricing with such vendors 
additionally  we offer our ovpp sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase 
our ovpp contracts under this sales type financing program are typically one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i one to four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the monthly revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our ovpp financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
in the event that we do sell the future revenue streams  we recognize revenue based on the net present value of the future payments from the third party finance company upon completion of the project 
deferred revenue or deferred costs are recorded for project sales consisting of multiple elements  where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met 
the majority of our deferred revenue relates to advance customer billings or to prepaid services to be provided at determined future dates 
as of march  and  our deferred revenue was million and million  respectively 
in the event that a customer project contains multiple elements that are not sold on a standalone basis  we defer all related revenue and costs until the project is complete 
deferred costs on product are recorded as a current asset as project completions occur within a few months 
as of march  and  our deferred costs were million and million  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and include raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
work in process inventories are comprised of raw materials that have been converted into components for final assembly 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials and related freight  labor and other applied overhead costs 
we review our inventory for obsolescence and marketability 
if the estimated market value  which is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  falls below cost  then the inventory value is reduced to its market value 
our inventory obsolescence reserves at march  and were million and million 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience with write offs and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we may not adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at march  and march  investments 
our accounting and disclosures for short term investments are in accordance with the requirements of the fair value measurements and disclosure  financial instrument  and investments debt and security topics of the fasb accounting standards codification 
the fair value measurements and disclosure topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
gaap describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of march  and  our financial assets were measured at fair value employing level inputs 
stock based compensation 
we have historically issued stock options to our employees  executive officers and directors 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for fiscal included the current period s cost for all stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  april  this cost was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of asc the cost for all stock options granted subsequent to march  represented the grant date fair value that was estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc results for prior periods have not been restated 
compensation cost for options granted after march  has been and will be recognized in earnings  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
both prior to and following our april  adoption of asc  the fair value of each option for financial reporting purposes was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants fiscal year ended march  weighted average expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected volatility expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield 
table of contents the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  including fair value  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividends  and expected forfeiture rate to calculate the fair value of stock based payment awards 
we estimated the expected term of our stock options based on the vesting term of our options and expected exercise behavior 
our risk free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on united states treasury zero coupon issues as of the option grant date with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the option 
for fiscal  and  we determined volatility based on an analysis of a peer group of public companies 
we intend to continue to consistently use the same methodology and group of publicly traded peer companies as we used in fiscal to determine volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose 
as required by our stock and incentive awards plan  since the closing of our initial public offering in december  we have solely used the closing sale price of our common shares on the nyse amex or the nasdaq global market on the date of grant to establish the exercise price of our stock options 
we recognized stock based compensation expense under asc of million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of march   million of total stock option compensation cost was expected to be recognized by us over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to recognize million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal based on our stock options outstanding as of march  this expense will increase further to the extent we have granted  or will grant  additional stock options in fiscal common stock warrants 
we issued common stock warrants to placement agents in connection with our various stock offerings and services rendered in fiscal and the value of warrants recorded as offering costs was  and  in fiscal and fiscal the value of warrants recorded for services was  in fiscal as of march   warrants were outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at weighted average exercise prices of per share 
these warrants were valued using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions i contractual terms of five years  ii weighted average risk free interest rates of to  iii expected volatility ranging between and  and iv dividend yields of 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our statements of operations 
our judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
for fiscal  we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net state deferred tax assets was necessary in the amount of  due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of state tax credits due to the carryforward periods 
in making this determination  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  recent financial performance and ownership changes 
we believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal that affected the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards  but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of the net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us 

table of contents as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax expenses that were associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we first recognize tax benefits from current period stock option expenses against current period income 
the remaining current period income is offset by net operating losses under the tax law ordering approach 
under this approach  we will utilize the net operating losses from stock option expenses last 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of million and state tax credit carryforwards of  which is net of a  valuation allowance 
both the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in varying amounts between and we recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax liabilities in income tax expense 
penalties and interest were immaterial as of the date of adoption and are included in unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the existence of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  all years since are open to examination by tax authorities 
by their nature  tax laws are often subject to interpretation 
further complicating matters is that in those cases where a tax position is open to interpretation  differences of opinion can result in differing conclusions as to the amount of tax benefits to be recognized under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
asc utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
consequently  the level of evidence and documentation necessary to support a position prior to being given recognition and measurement within the financial statements is a matter of judgment that depends on all available evidence 
as of march   the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million  all of which would reduce the company s effective tax rate if recognized 
we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
recent accounting pronouncements see note b summary of significant accounting policies to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing that may adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation 
our results from operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
foreign exchange risk 
we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign currency losses for all reporting periods have been nominal 
interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of investments in money market funds and certificate of deposits 
while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
as a result  we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
as of march   million of our million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
an increase of in the prime rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  per year 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to certain commodity price risks associated with our purchases of raw materials  most significantly our aluminum purchases 
we attempt to mitigate commodity price fluctuation for our aluminum through to month forward fixed price purchase orders and minimum quantity purchase commitments with suppliers 
additionally  we recycle legacy hid fixtures and recover the salvaged scrap value which we believe provides a raw materials cost hedge as commodity prices change
