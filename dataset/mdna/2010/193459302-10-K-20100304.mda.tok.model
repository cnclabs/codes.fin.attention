item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources refinancing of senior notes 
our high level of indebtedness and dependence on indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for capital expenditures  potential acquisition opportunities or general corporate or other purposes may be impaired  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  reducing the funds available to us for other purposes  it may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  may be limited in our ability to respond to competitive pressures and may have reduced flexibility in responding to changing business  regulatory and economic conditions 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is  to a large extent  dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations  we will need to refinance our existing debt  issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
our business may not be able to generate cash flow or we may not be able to obtain funding sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
growth through acquisitions is a significant part of our strategy and we may not be able to successfully identify  finance or integrate acquisitions in order to grow our business 
growth through acquisitions has been  and we expect it to continue to be  a significant part of our strategy 
we regularly evaluate possible acquisition candidates 
we may not be successful in identifying  financing and closing acquisitions on favorable terms 
potential acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing or issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  and any such financing and issuance of equity may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  our existing shareholders could be diluted  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
if we finance an acquisition with debt  it could result in higher leverage and interest costs 
further  we may not be successful in integrating any such acquisitions that are completed 
integration of any such acquisitions may require substantial management  financial and other resources and may pose risks with respect to production  customer service and market share of existing operations 
in addition  we may acquire businesses that are subject to technological or competitive risks  and we may not be able to realize the benefits expected from such acquisitions 

table of contents if we are unable to retain senior management and key employees  we may experience operating inefficiencies and increased costs  resulting in diminished profitability 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management and key employees 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees could result in operational inefficiencies and increased costs 
we may be unable to find qualified replacements for these individuals if their services were no longer available  and  if we do identify replacements  the integration of those replacements may be disruptive to our business 
advancing technologies  such as fiber optic and wireless technologies  may make some of our products less competitive and reduce our net sales 
technological developments could cause our net sales to decline 
for example  a significant decrease in the cost and complexity of installation of fiber optic systems or a significant increase in the cost of copper based systems could make fiber optic systems superior on a price performance basis to copper systems and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
also  advancing wireless technologies  as they relate to network and communication systems  may reduce the demand for our products by reducing the need for premises wiring 
wireless communications depend heavily on a fiber optic backbone and do not depend as much on copper based systems 
an increase in the acceptance and use of voice and wireless technology  or introduction of new wireless or fiber optic based technologies  may have a material adverse effect on the marketability of our products and our profitability 
if wireless technology were to significantly erode the markets for copper based systems  our sales of copper premise cables could face downward pressure 
we recorded significant impairment charges in and  and if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired  we may be required to recognize additional charges that would reduce our income 
we recorded significant impairment charges in and relative to our goodwill and other intangible assets 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  goodwill assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually  or more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable 
a further deterioration in the macro economic environment or other factors could necessitate an earnings charge for the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets  which would reduce our income without any change to our underlying cash flow 
we have incurred restructuring charges in the past and will likely incur additional restructuring charges in the future 
we have incurred significant restructuring costs in the past and will likely incur additional restructuring charges in the future 
we may not be able to achieve the planned cash flows and savings estimates associated with such restructuring activities if we are unable to accomplish them in a timely manner  are unable to achieve expected efficiencies or cost savings  or unforeseen developments or expenses arise 
as we respond to changes in the market and fluctuations in demand levels  we may be required to realign plant production or otherwise restructure our operations  which may result in additional and potentially significant restructuring charges 
some of our employees belong to a labor union and certain actions by such employees  such as strikes or work stoppages  could disrupt our operations or cause us to incur costs 
as of december   we employed persons  approximately of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  which expired on december   and has been extended through march  we began collective bargaining negotiations on january  if unionized employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage  if other employees were to become unionized  or if we are unable to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement when the current one expires  we could experience a disruption of operations  higher labor costs or both 
a strike or other disruption of operations or work stoppage could reduce our ability to manufacture quality products for our customers in a timely manner 

table of contents we may be unable to raise additional capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs if our operations do not generate sufficient funds to do so 
our business is expected to have continuing capital expenditure needs 
if our operations do not generate sufficient funds to meet our capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future  we may not be able to gain access to additional capital  if needed  particularly in view of competitive factors and industry conditions 
in addition  increases in the cost of copper increase our working capital requirements 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  or unable to obtain additional capital on favorable terms  our liquidity may be diminished and we may be unable to effectively operate our business 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety and other laws and regulations which could adversely effect our operations and business 
we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of each jurisdiction where we do business 
we are currently  and may in the future be  held responsible for remedial investigations and clean up costs of certain sites damaged by the discharge of regulated materials  including sites that have never been owned or operated by us but at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws 
certain of these laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  usc section et seq 
cercla  impose strict  and under certain circumstances  joint and several  liability for investigation and cleanup costs at contaminated sites on responsible parties  as well as liability for damages to natural resources 
we have established reserves for such potential liability and believe those reserves to be adequate  however  there is no guarantee that such reserves will be adequate or that additional liabilities will not arise 
see legal proceedings 
failure to comply with environmental laws can result in substantial fines  orders to install pollution control equipment and or claims for alleged personal injury and property damage 
changes in environmental requirements in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions and their enforcement could adversely affect our operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 
disruption in the importation of our raw materials and products and the risks associated with international operations could cause our operating results to decline 
we source certain raw materials and products from foreign based suppliers 
foreign material purchases expose us to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  possible difficulties in enforcing agreements  exchange rate fluctuations  difficulties in obtaining import licenses  economic or political instability  embargoes  exchange controls or the adoption of other restrictions on foreign trade 
although we currently manufacture the vast majority of our products in the us  to the extent we decide to establish foreign manufacturing facilities  our foreign manufacturing sales would be subject to similar risks 
further  imports of raw materials and products are subject to unanticipated transportation delays that affect international commerce 
we have risks associated with inventory 
our business requires us to maintain substantial levels of inventory 
we must identify the right mix and quantity of products to keep in our inventory to meet customer orders 
failure to do so could adversely affect our sales and earnings 
however  if our inventory levels are too high  we are at risk that an unexpected change in circumstances  such as a shift in market demand  drop in prices  or default or loss of a customer  could have a material adverse impact on the net realizable value of our inventory 
changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements may adversely affect our business 
as a manufacturer and distributor of wire and cable products  we are subject to a number of industry standard setting authorities  such as underwriters laboratories 
in addition  many of our products are subject to the requirements of federal  state  local or foreign regulatory authorities 
changes in the standards and requirements imposed by such authorities could have an adverse effect on us 
in the event that we are unable to meet any such standards when adopted  our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents our business is subject to the economic  political and other risks of operating and selling products in foreign countries 
our foreign operations  including in canada and china  are subject to risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad  such as economic and political destabilization  international conflicts  restrictive actions by foreign governments  nationalizations or expropriations  changes in regulatory requirements  the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations  adverse foreign tax laws and the threat posed by potential pandemics in countries that do not have the resources necessary to deal with such outbreaks 
over time  we intend to continue expanding our foreign operations  which would serve to increase the level of these risks relative to our business operations and their potential effect on our financial position and results of operations

asset impairments included approximately million recorded in primarily reflecting impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and certain plant and equipment associated with our oem segment  million of impairment charges consisting primarily of a non cash goodwill impairment recorded during the first quarter of across three of four reporting units comprising our distribution segment electrical distribution  wire and cable distribution  and industrial distribution 
this non cash goodwill impairment resulted from a combination of factors which were in existence at that time  including a significant decline in our market capitalization  as well as the recessionary economic environment and its then estimated potential impact on our business 
these impairment charges are further discussed and detailed within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which follows

table of contents for federal and substantially all state income tax liabilities arising out of our operations other than those conducted by our c corporation subsidiary 
on october   we ceased to be an s corporation and became a c corporation and  as such  are now subject to federal and state income tax 
the financial data for and reflects the retroactive presentation of the for stock split which occurred on october  in addition to net income loss  as determined in accordance with gaap  we also use the non gaap measure net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda as a means to evaluate the performance of our business  including the preparation of annual operating budgets and the determination of levels of operating and capital investments 
in particular  we believe ebitda allows us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for example  we believe the inclusion of items such as taxes  interest expense  and intangible asset amortization can make it more difficult to identify and assess operating trends affecting our business and industry 
we also believe ebitda is a performance measure that provides investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
ebitda s usefulness as a performance measure is limited  however by the fact that it excludes the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use ebitda as the sole measure of our performance 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
the following is a reconciliation of net income loss  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization expense ebitda debt amortization costs are a component of interest expense per the income statement  but included within depreciation and amortization for operating cash flow presentation 
accordingly  for the above presentations only  depreciation and amortization expense does not include amortization of debt issuance costs  which is included in interest expense 
total debt includes the current portion of long term debt and excludes the unamortized premium of million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively  related to the senior notes 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties  including those described under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a leading designer  developer  manufacturer and supplier of electrical wire and cable products for consumer  commercial and industrial applications  with operations primarily in the us and  to a lesser degree  canada 
we manufacture and supply a broad line of wire and cable products  which enables us to offer our customers a single source of supply for many of their wire and cable product requirements 
we manufacture our products in eight domestic manufacturing locations and supplement our domestic production with both international and domestic sourcing 
we sell our products to a variety of customers  including a wide range of specialty distributors  retailers and original equipment manufacturers oems 
virtually all of our products are sold to customers located in the us and canada 
during the first quarter of  we changed our management reporting structure and the manner in which we report our financial results internally  including the integration of our acquisitions for reporting purposes 
the changes resulted in a change in our reportable segments 
accordingly  we now have two reportable business segments distribution  and oem 
our distribution segment serves our customers in distribution businesses  who are resellers of our products  while our oem segment serves our oem customers  who generally purchase more tailored products from us which are in turn used as inputs into subassemblies of manufactured finished goods 
where applicable  prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the new reporting structure 
our net sales follow general business cycles 
additionally  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in net sales and cash flow 
historically  our sales have been somewhat higher in the third and fourth quarters relative to the first and second quarters due to increased customer demand in anticipation of  and during  the winter months and holiday season 
current business environment our business continues to face recessionary conditions which first arose during the fourth quarter of our sales volumes declined significantly during the fourth quarter of  as compared to both the fourth quarter of and first three quarters of we believe the rapid and significant declines in demand experienced during the fourth quarter of were a function of sizable inventory reductions made on the part of our customers in the face of overall weakened demand and a very uncertain and difficult economy in existence at that time 
in response to the recessionary conditions and lower market demand  we made major adjustments to our production capacity late in and early to better match our capacity to lower overall demand levels  as well as improve our operating efficiency and lower our overall overhead costs 
in this regard  we closed our manufacturing facility in east longmeadow  massachusetts in the second quarter of and our oswego  new york facility in the third quarter of these and other cost reduction efforts  along with our ability to timely and effectively match our plant capacity to market demand levels  have been  and will continue to be  key determinants of our profitability 
additionally  in contrast to the significant demand contraction experienced during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we experienced certain levels of demand stabilization during the last nine months of we are encouraged by this demand stabilization  as well as by the positive impact generated from our recent cost reduction and capacity adjustments 
we remain concerned  however  with industry pricing given reduced levels of overall demand and excess industry capacity 
these factors  as well as any further increases in the price of copper  which increased to an average per pound price of on the comex during the fourth quarter of  as compared to an average of per pound for the third quarter of  will likely continue to present challenges to our financial performance and operating cash flows in the near term 
we continue to manage our business with caution in view of these factors 
we are continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the 
table of contents macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant shutdowns or closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
acquisitions from time to time  we consider acquisition opportunities that have the potential to materially increase the size of our business operation or provide us with some other strategic advantage 
we made two such acquisitions during on april   we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of copperfield for million  including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments 
the acquisition of copperfield  which at the time of our acquisition was one of the largest privately owned manufacturers and suppliers of electrical wire and cable products in the united states with annual sales in excess of million  increased our scale  diversified and expanded our customer base and we believe has strengthened our competitive position in the industry 
on november   we acquired the electrical products business of katy  which operated in the us as woods industries inc woods us and in canada as woods industries canada inc woods canada  and together with woods us  woods 
woods was principally focused on the design and distribution of consumer electrical cord products  sold primarily to national home improvement  mass merchant  hardware and other retailers 
we purchased certain assets of woods us and all the stock of woods canada for million  including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments 
the acquisition of woods has expanded our us business while enhancing our market presence and penetration in canada 
results of operations for the acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates 
accordingly  our consolidated operating results reflect approximately nine months of copperfield activity april  to december   and one month of woods activity november  to december  we financed the above acquisitions primarily with proceeds received from the issuance of debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  thereby significantly increasing our total outstanding debt in production costs overview and impact of copper prices raw materials  primarily copper  comprise the primary component of our cost of goods sold 
for  copper costs have been estimated by us based on the average comex price to account for over of our total cost of goods sold 
as the price of copper is particularly volatile  price fluctuations can significantly affect of our sales and profitability 
we generally attempt to pass along changes in the price of copper and other raw materials to our customers 
however  this has proven difficult recently given lower overall demand and excess capacity existing in the wire and cable industry 
during  the average price of copper cathode on the comex was per pound  a decline of per pound  or  from the average price of per pound for in addition to the above noted factors  other factors affecting product pricing include the type of product involved  competitive conditions  including the extent of underutilized manufacturing capacity existing in the industry  and particular customer arrangements 
recent developments in february  we completed a private placement of million of unsecured senior notes due in the senior notes which we undertook to capitalize on what we believe were favorable conditions in the bond market at the time and to extend the maturity of our senior notes from to  while reducing our annual cash interest requirement from on the notes to on the notes 
we repurchased of the approximately million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding senior notes due the senior notes by means of a tender offer and consent solicitation 
following the completion of the tender offer and consent solicitation  we gave notice of the redemption of the remaining outstanding senior notes which we will redeem on march  in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  on january   we amended our revolving credit facility to permit the sale of the senior notes  to enhance our ability to create and finance foreign subsidiaries  and to liberalize key covenants to increase operating flexibility 

table of contents consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statement of operations data in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
our results for and reflect the full year impact of our above noted acquisitions  whereas the results for do not include the entire impact of the acquisitions  which occurred during the course of that year

these non gaap measures used by management include ebitda  which we define as net income before net interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda  adjusted ebitda  which is our measure of ebitda adjusted to exclude the impact of certain specifically identified items adjusted ebitda  and adjusted earnings per share  which we calculate as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted eps 
for the periods presented in this report  the specifically identified items include asset impairments and restructuring charges  gains on our repurchase of our senior notes in  foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded at our canadian subsidiary  and an inventory insurance allowance recorded in in relation to a theft that occurred in we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we employ the use of these measures in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and in determining our respective levels of operating and capital investments 
we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for example  we believe the inclusion of items such as taxes  interest expense and intangible asset amortization can make it more difficult to identify and assess operating trends affecting our business and industry 
we also believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are performance measures that provide investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
however  the usefulness of both ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures are limited by the fact that they both exclude the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to 
table of contents these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use either ebitda or adjusted ebitda as the only measures of our performance 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
finally  other companies may define ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures of other companies 
similarly  we believe our use of adjusted eps provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings reported for a given period 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that you  solely use adjusted eps to assess our financial and earnings performance 
we also use  and recommend that you use  diluted earnings per share in addition to adjusted eps in assessing our earnings performance 
the following tables  which reconcile our measure of adjusted eps to diluted earnings per share  and adjusted ebitda to net income  respectively  should be used along with the above statements of operations for the periods presented  in conjunction with the results of operations review that follows 
diluted earnings per share  as determined in accordance with gaap  to adjusted eps year ended december  in thousands diluted earnings loss per share asset impairments restructuring charges gains on debt repurchases foreign currency transaction loss gain insurance related recovery reserve adjusted diluted earnings loss per share net income  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense a income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization expense a ebitda asset impairments restructuring charges gains on debt repurchases foreign currency transaction loss gain insurance related reserve adjusted ebitda a depreciation and amortization expense shown in the above schedule excludes amortization of debt issuance costs  which are included as a component of interest expense 

table of contents the nature of each individual item shown in the table above which has been excluded from ebitda in order to arrive at our measure of adjusted ebitda for each of the periods presented is detailed in the analysis of operating results that follows 
earnings and performance summary we recorded a net loss of million or a loss of per diluted share in  as compared to net loss of million or a loss of per diluted share for  and net income of million per diluted share for for  we recorded ebitda of million  as compared to ebitda of million and million in and  respectively 
as set forth below  results for these periods were impacted by certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings reported for any given period 
the income statement review below contains further detail regarding each of these items 
asset impairments our results for were significantly impacted by non cash asset impairments of million million after tax  or per diluted share  primarily as a result of a non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of relative to our distribution segment 
for  we recorded million million after tax  or per diluted share in non cash asset impairments which were recorded in the fourth quarter of and primarily related to our oem segment 
restructuring charges our results for  and included million million after tax or per diluted share  million million after tax or per diluted share  and million million after tax or per diluted share  respectively  in restructuring charges primarily incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions  as well as our two plant closures 
gains on repurchase of senior notes in  we repurchased approximately million in aggregate par value of our senior notes and recorded an associated gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
foreign currency transaction loss gain we recorded a foreign currency transaction gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share in and a foreign currency transaction loss of million million after tax  or per diluted share in related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our canadian subsidiary 
insurance related reserve in  we recorded an allowance of million million after tax  or per diluted share in relation to an insurance receivable for an inventory theft that occurred in at a since closed facility 
further details regarding each of the above noted items is described in the below operations review 
excluding the impact of the above noted items  our results for as compared to  primarily reflect the impact of significantly lower overall demand levels given the recessionary conditions throughout  and the impact of this declined demand on our profitability  primarily in the form of lower overall gross profit 
we were  however  able to partially mitigate the impact of the decline in demand through our cost cutting and production right sizing efforts  as well as improved results in our oem segment 
for  our total sales volume measured in total pounds shipped decreased compared to this decline in overall volumes  coupled with the impact of lower average copper prices  were major factors in our revenues decreasing compared to levels 
however  despite the sales decline  our adjusted ebitda for declined at a slower rate in comparison to sales  a decrease of compared to levels  reflecting the favorable impact of major efforts made in to lower our overhead costs  and right size our production and distribution capacity 
in addition  we derived a benefit from significant improvement in our oem segment  where operating income increased from an operating loss of million recorded in to operating income of million realized in this improvement came despite significantly lower oem sales and reflected the favorable impact of our oem customer rationalization efforts  as further explained in the segment results section for oem 
we believe our management of costs and production capacity in has 
table of contents improved our operating leverage and that we are well positioned to benefit from any recovery in the overall economy and accompanying increase in market demand levels in the future 
other significant events  actions and accomplishments included continued to improve our capital structure 
we reduced our total outstanding debt by million in  with this reduction being in addition to a million reduction during in significant part as a result of concerted efforts across all of our production facilities to manage our working capital  particularly our inventory levels  to reflect lower demand and our customer rationalization within our oem segment  as further discussed in our operating results review below 
the million reduction in included the repurchase of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  which were purchased at a discount generating a million gain and lowering our interest expense 
please refer to the above recent developments section for information regarding the refinancing of our senior notes which occurred in february  fully integrated our copperfield acquisition  allowing us to achieve the production related and synergistic merger benefits associated with this acquisition and permitting us to operate with a single  company wide set of production and back office systems  thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of operations  closed facilities and consolidated the related operations of our east longmeadow  ma and oswego  ny facilities as part of our efforts to align manufacturing capacity with market demand 
in addition  our headcount at the end of totaled employees  which was down employees from december   including a number of support and indirect labor positions 
we believe our rightsizing and cost reduction efforts have lowered our overall fixed costs  which will further enhance our profitability if and when overall demand levels increase in the future 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales our net sales for were million compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in net sales reflected both lower sales volumes and lower average copper prices for as compared to our total sales volume measured in total pounds shipped decreased for compared to  with volumes declining in our distribution segment and in our oem segment 
the overall volume decline was primarily a function of significant contraction in demand across our business in the face of the recessionary conditions that were prevalent throughout the more significant sales volume decline noted within our oem segment reflected both the impact of recessionary conditions  as well as the impact of planned sales reductions within this segment resulting from our oem customer rationalization efforts  which are further discussed within our oem segment level analysis 
the magnitude of our overall year over year sales declines moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter of  given the significant decline in sales volumes experienced during the fourth quarter of for the fourth quarter of  our sales volumes declined compared to the same quarter last year 
while volume levels remained well below levels  we did experience certain levels of demand stabilization in the last three quarters of  with such demand stabilization contrasting with the significant contraction in demand experienced during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of we are encouraged by the demand stabilization we experienced during the last three quarters of if such trends continue  we would expect volumes to be at or above our volume levels 
however  we remain concerned with the potential for additional pricing pressures in the wire and cable industry given reduced overall levels of demand and excess industry capacity 
in addition to volume declines  our sales results as compared to reflected lower average daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex  which averaged per pound during  as compared to an average of per pound for the gross profit lower overall demand in as compared to  was the primary reason we generated million in total gross profit for  as compared to million for  which represented a decline of million  or a decline of 
we did  however  significantly improve our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin in compared to  primarily as a result of reducing costs and rightsizing our plant production and distribution platforms 
for  our gross profit margin improved to compared to for our gross profit margin in reflected the impact of a severe decline in sales demand which occurred during the fourth quarter of in response  we reduced our workforce and plant production  closing our 
table of contents production facilities for an extended period during the fourth quarter of these actions  while lowering our variable labor and overhead costs  were not enough to offset the unfavorable impact of increased unfavorable overhead variances given the rapid nature of the sales demand decline and resulting lower production levels 
as a result  we generated a gross margin rate of in the fourth quarter of  which lowered our annual gross margin rate for to 
in  we focused efforts on effectively reducing costs and adjusting plant capacity  including the closure and consolidation of two plants 
these efforts were a key factor in our ability to reduce unfavorable plant and overhead variances in and improve our operating leverage  thereby increasing our gross profit margin 
additionally  we believe our efforts in this regard also have us well positioned for any meaningful future improvement in demand levels  which we believe would further improve our gross margin rate and overall profitability 
as further discussed in the segment level analysis that follows  our oem segment gross profit and overall profitability also improved significantly from as the result of the above noted rightsizing efforts  as well as  our oem customer rationalization efforts undertaken late in  which greatly improved year over year results in both oem and  thus  our consolidated results 
to a lesser degree  our consolidated gross profit margin in as compared to was also favorably impacted by lower average copper prices in as compared to selling  engineering  general and administrative seg a expense we incurred total seg a expense of million for  as compared to million for  which represented a decline of million  or 
as noted above  our seg a expense for included a million non cash charge recorded relative to an insurance receivable for a inventory theft 
the remaining million decrease in seg a during  as compared to the same period last year  primarily reflects the impact of lower commission expense which accounted for million of the decrease  lower payroll related expense as a result of lower total headcounts which accounted for million of the total decrease  the favorable impact of resolving certain customer related collection and other matters which accounted for million of the decrease  and lower spending across a number of general and administrative expense areas which accounted for the remaining million of the overall decrease 
our seg a as a percentage of total net sales increased to for  as compared to for  reflecting the impact of lower expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over a lower net sales base 
intangible amortization expense intangible amortization expense for was million as compared to million for  with the expense in both periods arising from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in relation to our acquisitions 
the lower amortization expense in reflects the impact of an impairment charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of against our then existing balance in intangible assets and the accelerated amortization methodology used to amortize intangible assets 
asset impairments as noted above  for  we recorded a total of million in asset impairments as compared to million in during the first quarter of  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on a combination of factors which were in existence at that time  including a significant decline in our market capitalization during the first quarter of  as well as the recessionary economic environment in existence and its then estimated potential impact on our business 
as a result of performing the related impairment test during the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which represented impairment losses incurred within three of the four reporting units within our distribution segment electrical distribution  wire and cable distribution and industrial distribution 
further goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including further deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for our businesses 
the remaining million in asset impairment charges recorded in related to closed properties currently being marketed for sale 
the resulting adjusted carrying value for each of these closed properties represents our estimate of each property s fair value determined by management after considering the best information available and the likely assumptions market participants would use in valuing the assets 
for  we recorded million in non cash asset impairments which were primarily related to our oem segment 
the impairments  recognized in the fourth quarter of  primarily reflect the impact of our decision during that quarter to significantly downsize our sales projections for  and capacity within  the oem segment after having been unsuccessful in securing necessary price increases with certain oem 
table of contents customers 
these facts  as well as the impact that the declining economy was having on customers within the oem segment at that time  were all factors which gave rise to the asset impairments 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for were million  as compared to million for for  these expenses were primarily incurred in connection with severance for headcount reductions and for lease and holding costs incurred relative to those facilities closed during and we closed our east long meadow  massachusetts and oswego  new york facilities in march and august of  respectively 
for  restructuring charges primarily reflected costs incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions 
in addition  during the second half of  we announced and executed a series of separately planned workforce reduction initiatives  including a headcount reduction at our oswego  new york manufacturing facility  and workforce reductions at our el paso  texas facilities and within our corporate offices in waukegan  illinois 
the oswego reductions were made as the result of a decision to transition copper fabrication activities from the oswego plant to our bremen  indiana facility 
the el paso and corporate reductions were in part a function of our integration efforts  as well as in response to the deterioration of economic conditions during the fourth quarter of in total  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees during the fourth quarter of as a result of these actions 
we currently have nine closed facilities  five of which are leased for various lengths of time through  and four of which are owned  for which we are obligated to pay holding costs 
we anticipate paying between approximately million and million in such costs in without giving effect to our successfully negotiating any potential sales  subleases  or lease buy outs in relation to one or more of these properties 
we do not currently have any new significant restructuring initiatives planned for  however  management is continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
interest expense we incurred million in interest expense for  as compared to million for the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average outstanding borrowings in as compared to the same time period last year 
gain on repurchase of senior notes we recorded a million gain during resulting from our repurchase of million in aggregate par value of our senior notes 
other income loss we recorded other income of million in as compared to a loss of million in  with both years amounts reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on our canadian subsidiary 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared to an income tax benefit of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to an effective tax rate of for the same period last year 
this decline in our effective tax benefit rate primarily reflects the million pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded during a significant amount of the related goodwill did not have a corresponding tax basis  thereby reducing the associated tax benefit for the pre tax charge 
we would expect our tax rate to increase in the absence of further non deductible impairment charges and more closely approximate the statutory tax rate 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales our net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
our total sales volume measured in total pounds shipped increased for compared to these full year increases  due primarily to the expansion of our customer base as a result of our acquisitions  occurred during the first three quarters of the year and were not indicative of trends which existed at the end of during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant contraction in demand across our business in the face of recessionary conditions 
volumes declined throughout the quarter as compared to volumes during the first three quarters of  with the rate of decline accelerating toward the end of and into for the fourth quarter of  our total sales volume declined as compared to the same quarter in  reflecting volume 
table of contents declines of and within our distribution and oem segments  respectively 
the decline in distribution segment volume was mitigated somewhat by the impact of acquisitions  as the fourth quarter of included the full benefit of the woods acquisition  whereas the fourth quarter of included only one month of woods sales 
the significant fourth quarter volume declines were coupled with a sharp drop in the price of copper  reducing our fourth quarter sales to million  a decline of million  or  from the same quarter in during the fourth quarter of  copper averaged per pound  representing a decline compared to an average of per pound for the third quarter of  and a decline from an average price of per pound for the fourth quarter of this sharp fourth quarter decline in copper prices mitigated the impact of significant increases in copper prices noted during the first nine months of thus  for the year  the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound in  representing a decline from gross profit we generated million in total gross profit in compared to million in  a decline of million 
our gross profit margin for was compared to for both the decline in gross profit dollars and gross profit margin for reflected poor gross profit performance within the oem segment throughout most of  as well as a significant decline in fourth quarter gross profit across both the oem and distribution segments 
our total gross profit increased million in aggregate through the first three quarters of as the impact of our acquisitions more than offset declined margin within the oem segment 
this increase in margin recorded for the first three quarters of  however  was more than offset by a million decline in margin for the fourth quarter of  as compared to the same quarter in in response to the severe decline in sales demand during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our workforce and plant production  closing our production facilities for an extended period during the fourth quarter of to control stock levels given lower demand levels 
these actions lowered our variable labor and overhead costs  but were not enough to offset the unfavorable impact of increased unfavorable overhead variances given the rapid nature of the sales demand decline and resulting lower production levels 
these unfavorable variances were a significant factor in both the fourth quarter and full year gross profit declines as compared to the same periods in in addition  our margins were negatively impacted by a sharp drop in copper prices during the fourth quarter of  as we believe many competing suppliers lowered prices further and more rapidly in the face of the lowered overall demand and excess industry capacity than would be expected in the context of more normal market conditions 
in this regard  our gross profit included the unfavorable impact of a million charge recorded during the fourth quarter of to reflect a lower of cost or market adjustment for our on hand inventory as of december  this charge reflected the impact of the above noted severe decline in copper prices during late coupled with weakened sales demand which created downward pricing pressure in the market  reducing the market value for certain of our inventory below its first in  first out fifo carrying value and requiring an adjustment to reflect such inventory at the lower of cost or market at december  selling  engineering  general and administrative we incurred seg a expense of million in compared to million for  an increase of million 
as a percentage of net sales  seg a expense was in  as compared to in as noted above  seg a expense for included a non cash charge of million for an allowance established during for an insurance claim we filed for thefts which occurred in at our manufacturing facility in miami lakes  florida  which we have since closed 
during the third quarter of  as a result of failing to secure satisfactory settlement of the matter with our insurers  we commenced legal action in regard to this matter and recorded an allowance for the related insurance receivable 
excluding the impact of this non cash charge  seg a expense for was million  or of total net sales for the remaining million increase in seg a expense for as compared to included a million increase in payroll related expenses  as reduced incentive based payroll expense was more than offset by the impact of headcount increases occurring during the first half of these increases were largely as a result of employees added from our acquisitions 
we significantly reduced our headcount in the second half of  in part due to the integration of the acquisitions  as well as in response to the sharp decline in sales demand experienced late in  as noted above 
the remaining million increase in seg a expense from occurred across a number of general expense categories  most notably professional fees and information technology expenses associated primarily with our integration efforts 
intangible amortization expense we recorded a total of million and million in amortization expense for and  respectively  in connection with intangible assets recognized as part of our 
table of contents acquisitions  with the increased expense recorded in mainly attributable to the fact that reflected a full year of intangible amortization expense 
asset impairments we recorded a total of million in non cash asset impairments in the charges were primarily related to our oem segment as discussed above in the comparison of and consolidated operating results 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared to million in for  these expenses were primarily incurred in connection with the integration of our acquisitions 
interest expense we incurred million in interest expense in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to additional expense related to the notes and increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during during the course of  we increased our total debt level significantly to fund our acquisition activities  including the acquisition of copperfield in april of and woods in november these increased debt levels increased our interest expense for  as compared to  which did not contain a full year impact of the higher borrowing levels brought about by the acquisitions 
we did  however reduce our debt levels during the second half of  and at december   our total debt was million  down from total debt of million outstanding at december  other income loss as noted above  other loss for primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on our canadian subsidiary 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december   with the decline reflecting the pre tax loss in segment results the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data by segment in thousands of dollars  segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales

accordingly  we do not identify net assets to our segments 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this document 
distribution segment for  net sales were million  as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
as noted above in our discussion of consolidated results  this decrease was due primarily to a decline in sales volumes and copper prices as compared to for  our distribution segment sales volume measured in total pounds shipped decreased compared to operating income was million for  as compared to million for  a decline of million  primarily reflecting the above noted impact on gross profit of decreased sales volumes in  partially offset by an improved gross margin rate and lower seg a expense 
our segment operating income rate was for  as compared to for the improvement in the operating income rate in was primarily due to the favorable impact in of cost rationalization efforts and the unfavorable impact on results that arose from significant unfavorable overhead variances recorded during the fourth quarter of that year due to a rapid and significant decline in volume levels during the fourth quarter of in  net sales increased million  from million to million  or  compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase in our sales in this segment during the first three quarters of  partially offset by a significant decline in volume during the fourth quarter of our sales increased in this segment during the first three quarters of due both to increased copper prices and more notably an increase in our customer base as a result of our acquisitions which occurred during the course of as noted above in our review of consolidated results  during the fourth quarter of we experienced a significant contraction in demand across our business 
our total sales volume declined within our distribution segment during the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of  with the decline mitigated somewhat by the impact of acquisitions  as the fourth quarter of included the full benefit of the woods acquisition  whereas the fourth quarter of included only one month of woods sales 
these significant fourth quarter volume declines were coupled with a sharp drop in the price of copper  reducing our total distribution net sales for the quarter to million  a decline of million  or  from the fourth quarter of operating income was million in compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was a function of a significant decline in operating income recorded during the fourth quarter of  as compared to prior quarters in  as well as as noted above  the recessionary conditions existing during the fourth quarter of caused a significant and rapid decline in our volumes 
given this rapid decline  our profitability decreased for the same period  as we were not able to offset the impact of the decline with cost savings associated with reduced production levels 
as a result  we experienced a significant increase in unfavorable overhead variances during the quarter 
oem segment for  net sales were million  as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
as noted above in our discussion of consolidated results  this decrease was due to a decline in sales volumes and copper prices as compared to for  our oem segment sales volume measured in total pounds shipped decreased compared to in addition to the impact of recessionary conditions prevalent throughout  the decline in volume also reflected the impact of our customer rationalization efforts within oem 
in late  we decided to reduce the extent of our sales to many customers within this segment as a result of failing to secure adequate pricing for our products from such customers 
we determined these actions were necessary to improve the overall financial performance of the company 
as our oem customer rationalization was completed in late  we do not anticipate any further impact to our oem revenues from such rationalization efforts 

table of contents operating income was million for  as compared to an operating loss of million for  an increase of million 
our segment operating income rate was for  as compared to for both the increase in operating income and the improvement in operating income rate during  as compared to  primarily reflected the favorable impact of the above noted oem customer and cost rationalization efforts as discussed in our above review of consolidated results 
for  net sales were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
as noted above  this increase was due primarily to increased sales recorded during the first half of as a result of an increase in our customer base resulting from our acquisitions that occurred after the first quarter of oem segment sales declined during the second half of  with a significant decline during the fourth quarter of in the face of recessionary conditions 
for the fourth quarter of  our total sales volume declined within our oem segment  as compared to the fourth quarter of  reflecting decreased demand from existing customers which were particularly affected by the then existing economic circumstances 
we recorded an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million for  a decline of million 
the oem operating loss for excludes the impact of asset impairment charges  which we record as a component of corporate related expenses 
in addition to the impact of a severe decline in fourth quarter sales and profits as a result of recessionary conditions prevalent during that quarter  our oem results for were also negatively impacted by our inability to timely pass on inflationary raw material cost increases to our customers within this segment during net sales by groups of products net sales across our four major product lines were as follows net sales by groups of products in thousands industrial wire and cable electronic wire assembled wire and cable products fabricated bare wire total as noted above  we are organized internally according to the customers we serve  which is reflected in the structure of our reportable segments oem and distribution 
therefore  we do not focus internally on the operating performance or profitability of our business by product grouping  as shown in the above table 
in relation to the data presented above  however  we note that  while all product categories experienced net sales declines in as compared to that are primarily reflective of the general recessionary conditions existing throughout  product sales in our electronic wire grouping declined at a more significant level 
while we do not have visibility to the specific end markets into which our products are ultimately sold  based on the nature of  and general applications for  such products  we believe the relatively more significant decline within the electronic wire grouping is reflective of the fact that many of the products within this category  such as thermostat  irrigation  security and telephone wire  are used in residential and commercial construction 
we would not expect any significant increase in sales in within this category given the current condition of these markets 
the decline in fabricated bare wire sales for as compared to reflects the above noted impact of recessionary condition existing throughout and  to a lesser degree  our decision  upon closing our oswego  new york facility  to exit some specially fabricated bare wire production also of note is the sharp increase in the level of sales within the assembled wire and cable products category between and this increase was reflective of the addition of woods in late  which increased our sales levels within this category 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources debt our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations was as follows as of december  in thousands revolving credit facility expiring april  senior notes due october   including unamortized premium of  and  respectively capital lease obligations total debt as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  we also had approximately million in remaining excess availability under our revolving credit facility at december   as compared to million of excess availability at december  refinancing of senior notes due october  the senior notes with senior notes due february  the senior notes at december   we had approximately million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes  all of which were scheduled to mature on october  on february   we completed a private placement offering of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes to refinance our senior notes the private placement 
the senior notes mature on february  and interest on these notes will accrue at a rate of per annum and be payable semi annually on each february and august  commencing august  the gross proceeds from the private placement  approximately million which reflects a discounted issue price of of the principal amount  were used  together with other available funds  for payment of consideration and costs relating to a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for our senior notes 
a total of million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes were tendered  which represented approximately of the approximately million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding 
consequently  as of march   approximately million of the senior notes remain outstanding 
we will redeem the million in remaining outstanding senior notes on march  at a price of of the principal amount of such senior notes  which  excluding accrued and unpaid interest  will equate to a total redemption amount of approximately million 
we undertook the above described refinancing of our senior notes to take advantage of what we believe were favorable conditions within the related financial markets at the time 
the refinancing also allowed us to liberalize our bond covenants  extend the maturity of such debt from to  while at the same time reducing our annual cash interest requirements given the lower coupon rate on the senior notes  partially offset by an increase in the total aggregate principal amount outstanding 
we expect to record a loss of between approximately million and million in the first quarter of on the early extinguishment of our senior notes 
this amount includes the write off of approximately million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes  as well as the impact of the call and tender premiums  and other costs paid in connection with the refinancing 
the senior notes are non callable for the first four years subsequent to issuance 
thereafter  the senior notes are callable at a price equal to par plus one half the coupon rate  declining ratably to par by the end of the sixth year 
in addition  the senior notes have a provision allowing us to redeem up to of the principal amount outstanding at any time during the first three years subsequent to issuance with the use of proceeds generated by one or more possible future equity offerings 
as with the indenture that governed the senior notes  the indenture for the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make restricted payments  create liens  pay dividends  sell substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates of the company 
in addition  the 
table of contents senior notes were issued with registrations rights  whereby we are obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts to register with the sec an exchange offering of new notes  having terms substantially identical to those of the senior notes  except that the new notes will be freely tradeable 
this sec registration and exchange offering is planned for revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility is a senior secured facility that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million  subject to certain limitations as discussed below 
the proceeds from the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including merger and acquisition activity 
at december   we had approximately million in remaining excess availability under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility was amended on june  in connection with the above noted senior notes repurchases to permit us to spend up to million to redeem  retire or repurchase our senior notes so long as i no default or event of default existed at the time of the repurchase or would result from the repurchase and ii excess availability under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to the repurchase remained above million 
prior to this amendment  we were prohibited from making prepayments on or repurchases of the senior notes 
the amendment required us to pay an upfront amendment fee of million  and also increased the applicable interest rate margins by and the unused line fee increased by 
accordingly  subsequent to the amendment  interest is payable  at our option  at the agent s prime rate plus a range of to or the eurodollar rate plus a range of to  in each case based on quarterly average excess availability under the revolving credit facility 
we further amended our revolving credit facility on january   in connection with the issuance of the senior notes i to permit the sale of the senior notes ii to enhance our ability to create and finance foreign subsidiaries  iii to liberalize key covenants and make other changes to increase operating flexibility 
pursuant to this amendment  borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility for foreign subsidiaries is limited to the greater of i the sum of of the aggregate book value of accounts receivable of such foreign subsidiaries plus of the aggregate book value of the inventory of such foreign subsidiaries and ii million excluding permitted intercompany indebtedness of such foreign subsidiaries 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum of million in excess availability under the revolving credit facility at all times 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to the lesser of i million or ii the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and an advance rate to be determined of certain appraised fixed assets  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiary and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiary  including accounts receivable  inventory and any other tangible and intangible assets including real estate  machinery and equipment and intellectual property as well as by a pledge of all the capital stock of our domestic subsidiary and of the capital stock of our canadian foreign subsidiary  but not our chinese owned entity 
the revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  make investments  provide guarantees  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  enter into leases or sale and lease back transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition to maintaining a minimum of million in excess availability under the revolving credit facility at all times  the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to for any month during which our excess availability under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
we maintained greater than million of monthly excess availability during as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants on our revolving credit facility 
current and future liquidity in general  we require cash to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment and to pay interest costs related to our debt 
our working capital requirements tend to increase when we experience significant 
table of contents increased demand for products or significant copper price increases 
conversely  when demand declines or copper prices fall  our working capital requirements generally decline as well 
we may be required to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the future if  among a number of other potential factors  the price of copper further increases  thereby further increasing our working capital requirements 
our management assesses the future cash needs of our business by considering a number of factors  including historical earnings and cash flow performance  future working capital needs  current and projected debt service expenses  planned capital expenditures  and our ability to borrow additional funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
based on the foregoing  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings against our million revolving credit facility and had million in cash on hand  as well as million in excess availability 
if we experience a deficiency in earnings with respect to our fixed charges in the future  we would need to fund the fixed charges through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if cash flows generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  are not sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures and we need to seek additional sources of capital  the limitations on our ability to incur debt contained in the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes could prevent us from securing additional capital through the issuance of debt 
in that case  we would need to secure additional capital through other means  such as the issuance of equity 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we were not able to secure additional capital  we could be required to delay or forego capital spending or other corporate initiatives  such as the development of products  or acquisition opportunities 
our revolving credit facility permits us to redeem  retire or repurchase our senior notes subject to certain limitations 
we may repurchase senior notes in the future but whether we do so will depend on a number of factors and there can be no assurance that we will repurchase any amounts of our senior notes 
cash flow summary a summary of our cash flows for  and was as follows as of december  in thousands net loss income non cash items changes in working capital assets and liabilities net cash from operating activities net cash from investing activities net cash from financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the million decline in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to was largely a result of the impact of changes in working capital items  primarily changes in inventory  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
lower consolidated inventory levels at december   compared to levels at december   generated approximately million in operating cash flows in this improvement 
table of contents was in addition to a million increase in operating cash flows generated in relative to inventories  as a sharp decline in copper prices during the fourth quarter of  as well as a reduction in inventory levels given a significant reduction in demand at that same time and the impact of our oem customer rationalization efforts  significantly lowered our required working capital investment in inventory at december   as compared to december  similarly  we generated million in operating cash flows from accounts receivable during as a result of lower outstanding receivable levels at december  compared to december   which primarily reflected the impact of lower overall demand levels in this improvement in was in addition to a million increase in operating cash flows generated in relative to accounts receivable  as a sharp decline in copper prices during the fourth quarter of  as well as a reduction in receivable levels given a significant reduction in demand at that same time  significantly lowered our required working capital investment in accounts receivable at december   as compared to december  these significant improvements in operating cash flows generated from inventories and accounts receivable realized in create unfavorable year over year comparisons when is compared with the impact of such items on year over year cash flows was partially offset  however  by changes in our accounts payable levels over the same periods 
for  we recorded a use of million in operating cash flows relative to accounts payable compared to a use of million in this change reflects a significant reduction in accounts payable levels at the end of given the above noted sharp decline in copper prices and demand levels that occurred in the fourth quarter of  which lowered our overall level of accounts payable at that time 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to primarily reflects the above described changes in working capital requirements brought about by a sharp decline in copper prices and demand levels at the end of  partially offset by lower levels of income in as compared to investing activities net cash utilized for investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million decline in cash utilized for investing activities between and  primarily reflects million in capital expenditures in  primarily associated with our new facilities in pleasant prairie  wisconsin and el paso  texas  both of which were opened that year 
the million in cash used in investing activities in primarily was attributable to the acquisition of both copperfield and woods in that year  which accounted for million of the total 
we would expect our capital expenditures to approximate levels 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the million used in financing activities for included million in net repayments made under our revolving credit facility during due to a reduction in debt primarily brought about by efforts to reduce our levels of working capital  million used to repurchase a portion of our senior notes  and million paid to amend our revolving credit facility 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided from financing activities of million in the million in cash used in financing activities in was due to a reduction in debt brought about both by a decline in the price of copper and  thus  our working capital needs  as well as efforts to reduce our overall working capital  including our inventory levels 
the million provided in was primarily a function of acquisition related borrowing activities 
as noted above  during we issued the million senior notes  generating total proceeds of million net of issuance costs  and increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which were million at december  seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in our sales and cash flow 
we generally require increased levels of cash during the second and third quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the late fall and early winter months 
in general  the trade receivables generated from these periods of relatively higher sales is subsequently collected during the late fourth and early first quarter of the year 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including current portion and interest capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total on february   we refinanced the senior notes with our senior notes 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources refinancing of senior notes 
long term debt obligations include million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility which has a maturity of interest obligations on our variable rate debt  primarily our borrowings under the revolving credit facility  have been calculated based on the prevailing interest rate at december  amounts of future interest payments made on such variable rate borrowings will depend on prevailing variable interest rates in future periods and the amount of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility for such periods 
purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders and other contractual arrangements for inventory and raw materials 
we anticipate being able to meet our obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of our products when the products are shipped to customers and title passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale 
we provide incentive allowances to our customers  with the amount of such promotional allowances being tied primarily to the particular customer s level of purchasing activity during a specified time period or periods 
we record an accrual for such promotional allowances and reflect the expenses as a reduction of our net sales when we determine that it is probable the allowances will be earned by the customer and the amount of the allowances are reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals primarily on sales activity and our historical experience with each customer 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date given the facts available to us at the time the allowance is recorded 
as was the case in  which included the full year impact of significant acquisitions made during the course of  our write off activity and allowance will generally increase with increases in the overall scale of our business 
establishing this allowance involves considerable judgment 
in calculating the necessary allowance for uncollectible accounts  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
we consider both the current financial condition of individual customers and historical write off patterns in establishing our allowance 
when we become aware that  due to deterioration of their financial condition or for some other reason  a particular customer is unable or unwilling to pay an amount owed to us  we record a specific allowance for receivables related to that customer to reflect our best estimate of the realizability of amounts owed 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to a general and significant deterioration in economic conditions and their impact on the financial condition of certain specific customers  including negative trends in the past due accounts of such customers  we determined it necessary to increase our write offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts well above the company s historical averages of recent years 
in  our bad debt experience improved  and we benefited from the resolution of certain customer related collection matters 
actual future collections of receivables could differ significantly from our estimates as a function of future  unforeseen changes in general  industry and specific customers financial conditions 
in addition  we reserve for customer credits and discounts expected to be issued relative to our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves are intended to reflect an estimate of future credits and discounts that are probable of issuance in relation to the existing accounts receivable balance  and these estimates are based on historical experience 
inventories inventories include material  labor and overhead costs and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out fifo method 
in applying fifo  we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to its condition or where the inventory cost for an item exceeds its net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
copper constitutes our primary inventory component 
during the fourth quarter of  copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound  representing a decline compared to an average of per pound for the third quarter of as a result of this sharp decline in copper prices coupled with the impact of significantly lower overall market demand on market pricing  we recognized a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write our inventories down to their lower of cost or market values 
though copper prices have increased since december   averaging and per pound for the full year and fourth quarter of  respectively  any significant future decline in copper prices at current or lower levels of market demand  would likely necessitate additional lower of cost or market adjustments  the magnitude of which would be a function of such price declines and overall market demand 
plant and equipment and other long lived assets plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from three to twenty years  using principally the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
our other long lived assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated amortization methodology which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
when events and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we test for the existence of impairment by developing and utilizing projections of future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets or asset groups in question 
our asset groups reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
expected cash flows are projected on an undiscounted basis over the remaining life of the assets or asset groups in question to determine whether such cash flows are expected to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets involved 
if we identify the existence of impairment as a result of employing this test  we determine the amount of the impairment loss by the extent to which the carrying value of the 
table of contents impaired assets exceed their fair values as determined by valuation techniques including  as appropriate  the use of discounted cash flows to measure estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in long lived asset impairments related to our plant and equipment and other long lived assets 
given our revised plans and projections for future performance of the oem segment in light of our customer rationalization efforts and our failure to secure necessary future price increases with significant oem customers  as well as the impact the declining economy appears to have had on such customers  we determined it necessary to test our oem related long lived assets for potential impairment during the fourth quarter of  and recorded the above noted impairment charges as a result of such analysis 
the long lived asset impairment test uses significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating projected cash flows associated with our asset groups involved the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  engineering  general and administrative expense rates  discount rates and cash flows 
these estimates were based on our revised business plans and forecasts in light of the above noted facts and circumstances 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments  such as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows or in the discount rate used to discount such cash flows could have significantly increased or decreased the related impairment charge 
for example  as of december   a increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the associated asset groups without any change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the impairment charge recorded as of such date  and a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate used without any change in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows would have resulted in a decrease or increase of approximately million in the impairment charge recorded as of such date 
the above described sensitivities are presented solely to illustrate the effects that a hypothetical change in one or more key variables might have on the outcomes produced by the impairment testing process 
further impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in a number of factors or circumstances occur  including but not limited to further deterioration in the performance of and future projections relative to  or changes in our plans for one or more of our long lived asset groups or facilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets under goodwill accounting rules  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level 
we perform our annual test for potential goodwill impairment as of december st of each year 
the test requires that a fair value estimate be made at the reporting unit level as of the test date 
potential impairment exists if the carrying amount of net assets of a particular reporting unit  including goodwill  as of the test date exceeds the then estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we have determined that our operating segments appropriately serve as reporting units  as defined by the accounting rules governing  and for purposes of applying  our goodwill impairment tests 
determining the carrying value  or the net assets for an individual reporting unit  requires the use of estimation and allocation methodologies given the shared nature of many of our assets and liabilities 
to the extent possible  we identify assets  such as trade receivables  and liabilities specific to each specific reporting unit  however  given our use of primarily shared production facilities and resources  assets such as inventory  fixed assets and accounts payable have to be allocated on a basis reflective of our best estimate of their relative usage by each reporting unit 
then  in performing the above described test  if it is determined that the carrying value of a particular reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill must next be determined 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment of goodwill is deemed to have taken place and a loss is recorded equal to the amount of the excess 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on a combination of factors which were in existence at that time  including a significant decline in our market capitalization  as well as the recessionary economic environment and its then estimated potential impact on our business 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  representing our best estimate of the impairment loss incurred within three 
table of contents of the four reporting units within our distribution segment electrical distribution  wire and cable distribution and industrial distribution 
at the march  test date  no indication of impairment under the goodwill impairment test existed relative to our retail distribution reporting unit  and we did not have any goodwill recorded within our oem segment 
for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis  our estimates of fair value were based primarily on estimates generated using the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on their projected future discounted cash flows 
as of december   management determined that the fair values of all reporting units which carry goodwill  substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating a reporting unit s projected cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  engineering  general and administrative expense rates  capital expenditures  and cash flows 
these estimates are based on our business plans and forecasts 
these estimates are then discounted  which necessitates the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate used reflects market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the allocation of the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the estimated fair value of their net assets required under the second step of the goodwill impairment test also involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  or the estimated fair value of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
for example  as of march   a increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows of our reporting units without any change in the discount rate used in the first step of its goodwill impairment test as of such date would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units as of such date  a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units used in the first step of its goodwill impairment test as of such date would have resulted in a decrease or increase of approximately million in the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units as of such date  and a increase or decrease in the estimated sales growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units as of such date 
the goodwill impairment testing process is complex  and can be affected by the inter relationship between certain assumptions  estimates and judgments that may apply to both the first and second steps of the process and the fact that the maximum potential impairment of the goodwill of any reporting unit is limited to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
accordingly  the above described sensitivities around changes in the aggregate estimated fair values of our reporting units would not necessarily have a dollar for dollar impact on the amount of goodwill impairment we recognized as a result of our analysis 
these sensitivities are presented solely to illustrate the effects that a hypothetical change in one or more key variables affecting a reporting unit s fair value might have on the outcomes produced by the goodwill impairment testing process 
in addition to the above noted interim goodwill impairment test performed during the first quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   with no indication of potential impairment 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with recorded goodwill as of december  was significantly in excess of its related carrying value  with no such reporting unit having an excess of fair value less than of its carrying value 
as stated above  the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets 
however  as of the december  annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion  that no indication of goodwill impairment existed as of the test date  would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a decrease in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows of our reporting units without any change in the discount rate  a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair 
table of contents values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  or decrease in the estimated sales growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit 
goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the distribution reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including further deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
our other intangible assets primarily consist of acquired customer relationships and trademarks and trade names  all of which have finite or determinable useful lives 
accordingly  these finite lived assets are amortized to reflect the estimated pattern of economic benefit consumed  either on a straight line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited 
see note for information regarding our asset impairment analyses 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
a provision for income tax expense is recognized for income taxes payable for the current period  plus the net changes in deferred tax amounts 
we periodically assess the reliability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state or federal statutory tax audits 
new accounting pronouncements other than as described below  no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
disclosures about derivatives instruments in march  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new guidance expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance specifically requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures addressing the following how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of the required disclosures have been set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements and disclosures in august  the fasb issued an accounting update on fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides additional guidance clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value 
it clarifies how the price of a traded debt security should be considered in estimating the fair value of the issuer s liability 
we adopted this accounting update in the fourth quarter of  and its adoption did not have any significant impact on our financial statements 
postretirement benefit plan assets in december  the fasb issued guidance on employers disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets 
the accounting guidance provides additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans 
the guidance requires disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made  the fair value of each major category of plan assets  valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets  the impact of measurements on changes in plan assets when using significant unobservable inputs and significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets 
these disclosures are required for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted this guidance for the period ending december  see note 

table of contents participating securities in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this accounting guidance addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
the guidance concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
if awards are considered participating securities  we are required to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share 
we have determined that our outstanding unvested shares are participating securities 
effective january   we adopted this standard 
accordingly  earnings per common share are computed using the two class method prescribed by the accounting guidance 
all previously reported earnings per common share data has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the new computation method see note 
variable interest entity in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting guidance for consolidation 
accordingly  new accounting standards concerning the treatment of variable interest entities were issued 
this guidance addresses the effects on certain provisions of consolidation of variable interest entities as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept 
this guidance also addresses the ability to provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
the accounting update is effective for each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
we do not anticipate this guidance will have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  primarily copper prices  interest rates on borrowings  and exchange rate risk relative to our operations in canada 
commodity risk 
certain raw materials used in our products are subject to price volatility  most notably copper  which is the primary raw material used in our products 
the price of copper is particularly volatile and can affect our net sales and profitability 
we purchase copper at prevailing market prices and  through multiple pricing strategies  generally attempt to pass along to our customers changes in the price of copper and other raw materials 
from time to time  we enter into derivative contracts  including copper futures contracts  to mitigate the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of copper on our pricing terms with certain customers 
we do not speculate on copper prices 
all of our copper futures contracts are tied to the comex copper market index and the value of our futures contracts varies directly with underlying changes in the related comex copper futures prices 
we record these derivative contracts at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
at december   we had contracts with a net aggregate fair value of million  consisting of contracts to sell  pounds of copper in march a hypothetical adverse movement of in the price of copper at december   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in an aggregate loss in the fair value of our commodity futures contracts of approximately million as of december  interest rate risk 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our debt obligations 
as of december   approximately of our debt was variable rate  primarily our borrowings under our revolving credit facility for which interest costs are based on either the lenders prime rate or a libor based rate 
based on the amount of our variable rate borrowings at december   which totaled approximately million  an immediate one percentage point change in libor would change our annual interest expense by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the amount of variable rate borrowings remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our canadian operations 
currently  we do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk using any financial or derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts or hedging activities 
the 
table of contents strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the usdollar had a positive impact on our canadian results in in  we recorded an aggregate pre tax gain of approximately million related to exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and canadian dollar
