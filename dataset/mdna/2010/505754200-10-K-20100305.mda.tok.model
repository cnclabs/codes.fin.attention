no estimates have been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assumed an annual long term rate of return on the plans assets of and for and  respectively 
for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on the plans assets of 
the company used a rate of for its discount rate assumption for  a decrease from the rate used for an increase in the discount rate results in a decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability included as a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such an increase also results in an actuarial gain which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb asc a decrease in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
the company cannot predict the level of interest rates in the future and correspondingly cannot predict the future discount rate which will be applied to determine the company s projected benefit obligation 
as demonstrated in the chart below  relatively small movements in the discount rate  up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s projected benefit obligation under the plans 
projected plan benefit obligation as of december  dollars in millions at discount rate at discount rate at discount rate 
table of contents nor can the company predict with any certainty what the actual rate of return will be for the plans assets 
as demonstrated in the chart below  a modest change in the presumed rate of return on the plans assets will have a material impact upon the actual net periodic cost for the plans 
net periodic benefit for year ending december  dollars in millions expected return expected return expected return fair value measurement of pension assets fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a framework and provides guidance on measuring the fair value of assets in a pension plan and how an employer should disclose the same 
the framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are described as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the following table sets forth by level dollars in millions  within the fair value hierarchy  the plans assets at fair value as of december  plans assets level level level total goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the cost of acquired net assets in excess of their fair market values 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in accordance with asc  a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 

table of contents for the purpose of goodwill analysis  the company has only one reporting segment  as defined by asc goodwill of million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
goodwill increased significantly in due to the acquisitions of aerex and chen tech 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
the company s assessment of fair value used in the annual impairment testing takes into account a number of factors including ebitda and revenue multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
no impairments were recognized in  or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense 
the company has million of amortizable customer relationships included in other intangible assets that are being amortized over years with annual amortization of million
