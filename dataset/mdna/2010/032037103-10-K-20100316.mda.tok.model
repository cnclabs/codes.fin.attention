item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation operates in two business segments 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel and the davy roll company limited davy roll 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas davy roll produces cast iron and steel rolls in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment includes aerofin  buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  all divisions of air liquid systems corporation 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling makes custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment has operations in virginia and new york with headquarters in pennsylvania 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
in  the forged and cast rolls group was affected by the slowdown of manufacturing activity throughout its customer base resulting from the global economic downturn 
customers were forced to curtail their level of steel and aluminum production  temporarily idle facilities and place new mill projects on hold 
while there were deferrals and attempts to cancel existing orders on hand  the segment was successful in rescheduling deliveries to future periods 
cancellations were minimal 
there are signs that the markets served are beginning to recover  particularly in asia  and we believe a global shortage of capacity for forged hardened steel rolls will remain when world steel production returns to pre levels 
the need for additional rolls  however  is expected to lag the economic recovery until companies consume their existing excess inventories 
expectations for are for a modest increase in roll consumption in the industry and  for us  a gradual improvement in production levels 
the major capital investment program for the group which began in continues 
the expansion at union electric steel s melting and forging facility is complete and installation of a forge press  manipulator and ancillary equipment is targeted for furnace upgrades at davy roll were finished in recently  our board of directors approved the expansion of the heat treatment capability at davy roll in when business returns to more normal volumes  these projects will be critical to minimize equipment downtime  maintain the manufacture of premium quality product  enhance self reliance  and maximize capacity and productivity 
union electric steel mg roll company  ltd 
ues mg  the chinese joint venture company in which union electric steel holds a interest  is expected to begin limited production in the fall of it will principally manufacture and sell forged backup rolling mill rolls of a size and weight currently not able to be produced by union electric steel 
the initial annual capacity of the joint venture was expected to approximate  metric tons  however  the global slowdown in roll consumption and the resultant current lack of demand for large backup rolls has caused the joint venture to reduce its initial capacity by approximately fifty percent 
union electric steel has exclusive rights for sales and marketing 
for the air and liquid processing segment  business activity generally trails the economy by six to twelve months 
with a strong opening backlog  operating results for were not affected as severely by the fragile economy as operating results for the forged and cast rolls segment 
order intake for the group declined as the year progressed resulting in an ending backlog lower than that of the past few years 
operating results for will be contingent on how quickly the segment s markets rebound and customer spending resumes 
with indicators that the global economy is in the initial stages of recovery  we are cautiously optimistic 
operating results for are anticipated to be good  but  with expectations for increasing direct material costs and higher pension and depreciation expense  it will be difficult to outperform operating results of additionally  we are financially liquid with over  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report

net sales  income loss from operations and backlog for were adversely affected by the worldwide economic downturn 
a more detailed synopsis of each is included in the respective segment discussion below 
the increase in corporate costs over the years is primarily attributable to stock based compensation costs and higher pension related costs and professional fees 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales was  and for  and  respectively 
the improvement for the current year is primarily due to lower raw material costs and lower labor charges related to reductions in manning and temporary layoffs to better match production schedules with customer needs offset by an increase in pension related costs 
the slight decline in from is attributable to higher costs for steel scrap and ferroalloys offset by better volumes during the first part of for the forged and cast rolls segment 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the dollar decrease in from is due to lower commissions which are based on a percentage of sales and lower freight costs primarily resulting from reduced volumes offset by higher pension related expenses and stock based compensation associated with stock options granted in and the dollar increase in from is principally attributable to recognition of stock based compensation associated with stock options granted in  higher sales commissions and freight as well as an increase in pension related costs 
the goodwill impairment charge represents the write off of goodwill associated with one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment 
we do not have any other material intangible assets 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents an extension of the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  through the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain businesses of the air and liquid processing segment see note to consolidated financial statements 
investment related income decreased in when compared to due to further decline in average interest rates during the year and a reduction in the amount available for investment 
despite the steady increase in investment balances throughout  investment related income decreased in when compared to as a result of the general decline in interest rates and lower realized appreciation of investments 
included in investment related income are dividends from our chinese cast roll joint venture company which approximated  and in  and  respectively 
interest expense for decreased from and attributable to lower interest rates on our variable rate industrial revenue bonds 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of additional provisions in of for environmental costs estimated to be incurred relating to the remediation of real estate previously owned whereas benefited from a reduction in an accrual for environmental remediation for unrelated locations which were previously sold 
also  foreign exchange losses were higher in than and our statutory income tax rate equals which compares to an effective income tax rate of  and for  and  respectively 
for  the income tax provision includes an additional charge to reflect a reduction in the effective state income tax rate for which certain net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
for  beneficial permanent differences for the domestic operations favorably impacted the effective income tax rate 
in addition  for and  the effective income tax rates were reduced by the reversal of valuation allowances previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with capital loss carryforwards 
equity losses in chinese joint venture represent union electric steel s share of the losses of ues mg 
since the joint venture is still in the construction stage and has not yet begun production  operating results have been insignificant 
limited production for the joint venture is anticipated to begin in the latter part of as a result of the above  we earned  or per common share for   or per common share for and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for the goodwill impairment provision and adjustment of net deferred income tax assets to their realizable amount 
net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for the estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through offset by the release of tax related valuation allowances associated with capital loss carryforwards 
net income for includes an after tax benefit of or per common share for the release of tax related valuation allowances associated with capital loss carryforwards 
forged and cast rolls net sales operating income backlog as a result of the weak economy and worldwide recession  net sales for declined when compared to the prior years primarily due to lower consumption of rolling mill rolls and the deferral of orders by customers  particularly for the cast roll business in england 
prior to the financial dislocation in the latter part of  the global steel and aluminum industries were operating at or near capacity 
additionally  revenues from the variable index surcharge program decreased in versus as a result of lower costs of certain commodities 
specifically  a majority of customer orders include a provision allowing the selling price to be increased or decreased  as applicable  for corresponding changes in the published index cost of certain raw materials eg  steel scrap and ferroalloys utilized in the manufacturing process 
while this variable index surcharge program helps to protect us and our customers against unpredictable changes in the cost of commodities used in the manufacturing process against the base cost of commodities used to establish selling prices at the time of order placement  there is a lag in timing of approximately six months between the recognition of these changes in our costs of products sold and in our revenues 
accordingly  as costs of commodities fell toward the end of and in  the amount of billable surcharge revenue on shipments lessened 
while reduced shipment levels negatively impacted operating income  the effect was minimized from lower raw material costs  principally for steel scrap and ferroalloys  temporary layoffs  reductions in manning  and a decrease in commission expense and freight costs 
net sales and operating income for improved against due primarily to higher volumes offset by increased costs for steel scrap and ferroalloys for the majority of the year 
operating income for also includes approximately of proceeds from the settlement of business interruption insurance claims relating to equipment breakdown at davy roll 
deterioration in the weighted average exchange rates used to translate sales and operating income of davy roll from the british pound sterling to the us dollar also reduced sales and operating income for when compared to by  and  respectively  and when compared to by  and  respectively 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents the decline in the backlog from the earlier years is a result of shipments outpacing new orders and  because of the variable index surcharge mechanism  downward adjustments to existing order values to reflect lower material costs 
order cancellations have been minimal 
to better match the changing production levels of the segment s customers  backlog remains subject to rescheduling including  in some situations  bringing forward orders previously deferred 
accordingly  it is difficult to accurately predict the proportion of backlog to ship in and thereafter  however  based on current estimates  approximately  is expected to be released after in addition  the forged and cast rolls group has commitments of roughly  from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of specific purchase orders closer to the requirement dates for delivery 
air and liquid processing operating income loss for includes a charge for asbestos litigation relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain businesses of the air and liquid processing segment of  see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
net sales operating income loss backlog net sales for were less than and attributable to lower business activity for buffalo air handling with construction projects for pharmaceutical companies  hospitals and universities adversely impacted by the weak economy 
sales for aerofin and buffalo pumps benefited from a strong opening order backlog and  during the first part of the year  new orders 
additionally  a shift in product mix aided aerofin s performance with increased shipments to electric utility customers offset by a reduction in lower margin sales to original equipment manufacturers 
buffalo pumps benefited primarily from the higher volumes of shipments to us navy shipbuilders 
lower raw material costs contributed further to the improvement in operating income 
due to uncertainties in the industry  including when business activity will return to historical levels as well as excess capacity in the market place  we determined that the goodwill associated with one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment was impaired and recorded a pre tax charge of  in the fourth quarter of with respect to  sales and operating income for buffalo pumps benefited from increased demand by power generation customers and us navy shipbuilders 
sales and operating income for aerofin improved against due to higher volumes from original equipment manufacturers and utility customers 
buffalo air handling experienced weak demand from the construction industry causing a decline in sales and operating income when compared to the previous year 
backlog of orders for each of the operations decreased when compared to and attributable to the economic slowdown and the fall off in new business during the latter part of the majority of the year end backlog is currently scheduled to ship in liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for equaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
although earnings improved in from  the prior year includes an after tax charge for asbestos related litigation of  which negatively impacted net income but did not affect cash flows provided by operating activities 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years and subject to tax benefits 
net asbestos related payments equaled   and in  and  respectively  and are expected to near  in the goodwill impairment charge  recorded in  does not impact net cash flows provided by operating activities 
contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans approximated  in of which  were voluntary contributions   in of which  were voluntary contributions and  in and exceeded net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for each of the years 
while required minimum contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans are expected to approximate  in  additional voluntarily contributions may be made 
accounts receivable decreased in when compared to as a result of the decline in sales during the fourth quarter of versus the increase in inventories at december  against december  is principally attributable to higher volumes of raw materials particularly steel scrap  ferroalloys and other commodities

capital expenditures continued to increase as a result of the major capital program which began in and is expected to be completed in as of december   anticipated future capital expenditures are expected to approximate  during  union electric steel made its final contribution of  to the chinese joint venture 
initial contributions of  were made in each of and additionally  davy roll contributed to its chinese cast roll joint venture in in  monies were deposited in escrow and are being held as collateral for the outstanding foreign currency sale contracts of davy roll 
a portion of these monies were returned by december  in connection with the diminishing exposure relating to the outstanding contracts 
net cash outflows from financing activities include payment of dividends of per common share in and and per common share in during and  stock options were exercised resulting in excess tax benefits 
no options were exercised during the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the british pound sterling against the us dollar 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents decreased by  in and ended the year at  in comparison to  and  at december  and  respectively 
funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance the operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we also maintain short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of our businesses

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  we are currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned and have been named a potentially responsible party at three third party landfill sites 
in addition  as a result of a sale of a segment  we retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination at two of the sold locations  one of which has been completed  and have agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination from one of these locations  the cost for which was accrued at the time of sale 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents the nature and scope of our business brings us into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  we and our subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  we do not anticipate that our financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  we and our subsidiaries are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment against the volatility in the cost of raw materials 
additionally  long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations and commitments have been executed for natural gas usage to cover a significant portion of orders in the backlog 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets  litigation  environmental matters  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from our actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
also  consideration is given to target and actual asset allocations  inflation and real risk free return 
we believe the expected long term rate of return of for our domestic plan and for our foreign plan to be reasonable 
actual returns on plan assets for and  respectively  approximated and for the domestic plan and and for the foreign plan 
the discount rates used in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
we believe the assumed discount rates of and as of december  for our domestic and uk plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
we believe the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  we and our subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of certain of our operating businesses asbestos liability and of an inactive subsidiary in dissolution and another former division of ours 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of our relevant insurance policies  prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending claims for asbestos liability nor for settlement or defense costs for claims that may be asserted against certain subsidiaries and us in the future 
for prior periods  we did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of pending or future claims 
to assist us in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability  along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amount of any estimates  we hired nationally recognized asbestos liability experts and insurance consultants 
the experts were not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary in dissolution or the former division  which we believe are immaterial 
based on their analyses  in  we established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through  and also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
these amounts relied on assumptions that are based on currently known facts and strategy 
in  we undertook another review of our asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries and determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated through december causing an additional provision of  actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect our asbestos liability and ability to recover under our insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
we intend to evaluate our estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these regular reviews may result in the incurrence of future charges  however  we are currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to our estimate of our recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  our tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of our operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   we have deferred income tax assets approximating  net of a valuation allowance of  we do not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  we would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if we subsequently determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  we would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  we believe the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate

accounting for stock based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
the fair value is affected by our stock price and various assumptions including assumptions about the expected term of the options  volatility  dividends and the risk free interest rate 
if the fair value of granted stock options was re determined  on a date other than the date of grant  the resulting fair value would differ 
accordingly  the fair value of stock options granted to date is not indicative of the fair value of stock options to be granted in the future see note to consolidated financial statements

the new guidance became effective for the year ended december  and the required disclosures are included in note to consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance relating to disclosures for fair value measurements and impairment of securities including determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
transactions are no longer presumed to be distressed or not orderly but  instead  will be determined on the weight of the evidence to indicate such 
also  new guidance was provided with respect to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments not currently reflected on the balance sheet of companies at fair value 
previously  fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed once a year but are now required on a quarterly basis 
additional guidance was also issued regarding the timing of the recognition of an impairment charge and the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold 
the new guidance became effective in and did not have a significant impact on our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
in august  the fasb issued asu  measuring liabilities at fair value  which provides clarification as to the determination of the fair value of a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
asu became effective in and did not impact us 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of levels and and a higher level of disaggregation for the different types of financial instruments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we view our primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  our policy is to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of our foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for our domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of our raw materials and energy  we enter into contracts for particular commodities copper and aluminum and purchase a portion of our energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  steel scrap and ferroalloys would have an impact of approximately  and  in and  respectively  with the reduction primarily being attributable to lower raw material costs in there is no guarantee that fluctuations in commodity prices will be limited to 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect us against such commodity price increases
