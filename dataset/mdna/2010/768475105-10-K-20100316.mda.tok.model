item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general as discussed previously  river valley was incorporated for the primary purpose of owning all of the outstanding shares of river valley financial 
as a result  the discussion that follows focuses on river valley financial s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of december   and river valley s results of operations for periods prior to that date  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
river valley s operations and river valley s actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include  but are not limited to  changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and river valley s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include those with respect to the effect future changes in interest rates may have on financial condition and results of operations  and management s opinion as to the effect on river valley s consolidated financial position and results of operations of recent accounting pronouncements not yet in effect 
effect of current events the global and us economies are experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past couple years 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
the availability of credit  confidence in the financial sector  and level of volatility in the financial markets have been significantly adversely affected as a result 
the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  the government has responded with a number of new and amended regulatory provisions 
many of these provisions directly or indirectly impact the company  including the eesa  tarp and the related cpp program  and changes to the federal deposit insurance program 
it is not clear at this time what impact the eesa  the tarp cpp  the temporary liquidity guarantee program  arra and other liquidity and funding initiatives  whether previously announced or that may be initiated in the future  will have on the financial markets and the other difficulties described above  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced  or on the us banking and financial industries and the broader us and global economies 
further adverse effects could have an adverse effect on the company and its business 
the level of turmoil in the financial services industry will present unusual risks and challenges for the company  as described below the current economic environment poses challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain national conditions and local conditions in our markets 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than months 
the risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth 
financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
while we are taking steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans  we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and we are affected by these events 
our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  and construction and land development loans 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences increases in loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  deposits may decrease  which would adversely impact our liquidity position  and collateral for our loans  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
impact of recent and future legislation 
congress and the treasury department have adopted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system and declines in the housing market 
see note  economic recovery programs  to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in this form k and incorporated herein 
the actual impact that eesa  arra and related measures undertaken to alleviate the credit crisis will have on the financial markets is unknown 
the failure of such measures to help stabilize the financial markets  and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
finally  there can be no assurance regarding the specific impact that such measures may have on us and no assurance whether or to what extent we will be able to benefit from such programs 
in addition to the legislation mentioned above  federal and state governments could pass additional legislation responsive to current credit conditions 
as an example  the bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the bank s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts 
also  the bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits its ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible 
also  as described in regulation recent legislative developments  both congress and the obama administration have announced proposals calling for sweeping changes to the united states financial system 
at this time  we cannot determine the likelihood that the proposed regulatory reform will be adopted in the forms proposed or the specific impact that any adopted legislation will have on the company or the bank 
additional increases in insurance premiums 
the fdic insures the bank s deposits up to certain limits 
the fdic charges us premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
the bank elected to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  which increased its insurance premiums during by basis points per annum 
current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures 
the fdic takes control of failed banks and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic has designated the deposit insurance fund long term target reserve ratio at percent of insured deposits 
due to recent bank failures  the fdic insurance fund reserve ratio has fallen below percent  the statutory minimum 
the fdic has implemented a restoration plan beginning january   that is intended to return the reserve ratio to an acceptable level over years 
the restoration plan has uniformly increased insurance assessments by basis points annualized and will increase them again by basis points annualized effective january  further increases in premium assessments are also possible and would increase the company s expenses 
also  in addition to the basis point special assessment of  that the company paid in september  the fdic required us to pay on december   actual and estimated third and fourth quarter assessments  totaling  plus a prepayment of all estimated  and assessments totaling million 
increased assessment rates and special assessments have had a material impact on the company s results of operations and could continue to do so 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings 
future reduction in liquidity in the banking system 
the federal reserve bank has been providing vast amounts of liquidity in to the banking system to compensate for weaknesses in short term borrowing markets and other capital markets 
a reduction in the federal reserve s activities or capacity could reduce liquidity in the markets  thereby increasing funding costs to the bank or reducing the availability of funds to the bank to finance its existing operations 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry 
we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us housing market 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and securities and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities  major commercial and investment banks  and regional financial institutions 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approach we use to select  manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we may be required to pay significantly higher deposit insurance premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject the corporation to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
a weakening of the real estate market in our primary market area could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
historically  indiana and kentucky have experienced  on occasion  significant natural disasters  including tornadoes and floods 
the availability of insurance for losses for such catastrophes is limited 
our operations could also be interrupted by such natural disasters 
acts of nature  including tornadoes and floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures our loans or interruption in our business operations  may also negatively impact our operating results or financial condition 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies for the year ended december  certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s assumptions about specific borrowers and current economic and business conditions  among other factors 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current economic condition  the amount of loans outstanding  identified problem loans  and the probability of collecting all amounts due 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolios 
in determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the company s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative  centralized credit policies  and uniform underwriting criteria for all loans as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit quality reviews and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the company s allowance consists of three components probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans  probable losses estimated from historical loss rates  and probable losses resulting from economic or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are considered impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
rather  standard credit scoring systems are used to assess credit risks 
reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category 
historical loss rates for loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs and non accrual loans  changes in mix  asset quality trends  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the company s internal loan review 
the portion of the allowance that is related to certain qualitative factors not specifically related to any one loan type is considered the unallocated portion of the reserve 
allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
the company s primary market area for lending is clark  floyd and jefferson counties in southeastern indiana and portions of northeastern kentucky adjacent to that market 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the company s customers 
during  the company refined its overall approach to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
this change is described more fully in item business allowance for loan losses and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation discussion of changes in financial condition from december  to december  valuation of mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total cost of loans  when sold  is allocated between loans and mortgage servicing rights based on the relative fair values of each 
mortgage servicing rights are subsequently carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
factors included in the calculation of fair value of the mortgage servicing rights include estimating the present value of future net cash flows  market loan prepayment speeds for similar loans  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
servicing rights are amortized over the estimated period of net servicing revenue 
it is likely that these economic factors will change over the life of the mortgage servicing rights  resulting in different valuations of the mortgage servicing rights 
the differing valuations will affect the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheet as well as the income recorded from loan servicing in the consolidated income statement 
as of december   mortgage servicing rights had a carrying value of  total carrying value at december   of  was reduced by a  charge to income for impairment on certain pools of servicing rights as of that date 
discussion of changes in financial condition from december  to december  at december   river valley s consolidated assets totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  over the december  total 
asset growth was funded by the growth in deposits with total deposits at december  of million  an increase of million  or  over the total for deposits at december  savings and demand deposits increased by million  or  during  while certificates of deposit also experienced strong growth of million  or  for the period 
total certificates of deposit at december  totaled million compared to million for strong deposit growth for the year points to the effectiveness of the bank s expansion into new markets in floyd and clark counties in indiana  and continued strong market share in the jefferson county  indiana area 
liquid assets ie  cash  federal funds sold and interest earning deposits increased by million from december  levels to a total of million at december  the increase in assets was primarily attributable to growth in the investment portfolio  from million at december  to million at the same date in  a growth of million or  as excess funds were invested for both short term liquidity and longer term earnings 
investments reported in the financial statements of the company are held both at the bank level and at the bank s nevada subsidiaries 
the company evaluates all investments for other than temporary impairment quarterly 
brought detailed scrutiny of the company s investments  and in particular of asset quality and changes in the fair values of the individual investments 
the company s securities are valued at fair value by a pricing service whose prices can be corroborated by recent security trading activities 
the company s portfolio is comprised of the following types of investments 
agency investments  which includes aaa rated federal home loan mortgage corp 
fhlmc  federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan bank fhlb investments  at an average book yield of  were at a net unrealized gain position at december  no agency investments were at an unrealized loss position for consecutive months or more 
the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
collateralized mortgage obligations  which includes governmentally guaranteed fnma  fhlmc  and government national mortgage association gnma remics  at an average book yield of  were at a net unrealized gain position at december  no collateralized mortgage obligation investments were at an unrealized loss position for consecutive months or more 
the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  which includes governmentally guaranteed fnma  gnma  and fhlmc gold pools  at an average book yield of were at a net unrealized gain position at december  no mortgage backed investments were at an unrealized loss position for consecutive months or more 
the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
municipal securities from a variety of sources  with an average tax equivalent yield of  were at a net unrealized gain position at december  three fourths of these investments are general obligation go bonds and the remainder are revenue bonds 
the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
at december   eleven municipal securities totaling million  or of the total municipal investments  were at an unrealized loss position  with gross unrealized losses of  as compared to fifty municipal securities at an unrealized loss position totaling  at the same date in of these investments  million were at an unrealized loss for consecutive months or more 
however  because the company does not intend to sell the investments and because it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity  the company does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  corporate investments  comprised entirely of two inactively traded trust preferred issues  with an average book yield of  were at a net unrealized loss position at december  both investments were at an unrealized loss for consecutive months or more 
because the company does not intend to sell the investments and because it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity  the company does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  these investments  with total carrying value of  represent of the total investment portfolio 
both issues of trust preferred represent some potential risk to the company simply by virtue of their attributes 
they are discussed individually below 
the alesco a class aa investment and the preferred term security xxvii  ltd investment are both thinly traded 
both issues are backed by financial institutions and insurance companies  and the current pricing reflects inactivity in the markets for trust preferred issues 
as the national economic woes have continued some of the underlying financial institutions have defaulted on or deferred interest payments 
while these defaults deferrals have negatively affected the lower tranches of the issues  the bank holds the top tranche of pretsl xxvii and the second highest tranche of alesco a 
the collateralization levels on these issues are still more than adequate for the bank to be protected 
both cash flow and other analysis  performed by independent third party analysts  and reviewed by management  indicates that it is more than likely that these investments will continue to maturity  and are thus only temporarily impaired 
cash flow analysis indicates that full payment of the tranches held by the bank is expected by maturity  if not before 
in november  the company purchased million face value of alesc a aa class preferred trust stock at a price of 
at december   this investment was priced by a third party pricing service and was carried on the company s books at a market value of  and at an amortized cost on that date of  the net unrealized loss on this investment at december  was  the company has reviewed the pricing analytics reports for this investment and has determined that the decline in the market price of this investment is temporary and indicates thin trading activity  rather than a true decline in the value of the investment 
factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or tranche held by the company  aa  the current collateral position of the tranche   and the projected cash flows as of december   which indicate that the company will receive all contractual payments 
because the company does not intend to sell the investments and because it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity  the company does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  in february  the company purchased million face value of pretsl xxvii ltd preferred trust stock at a price of 
at december   this investment was priced by a third party pricing service and was carried on the company s books at a market value of  and at an amortized cost on that date of  the net unrealized loss on this investment at december  was  the company has reviewed the pricing analytics reports for this investment and has determined that the decline in the market price of this investment is temporary and indicates thin trading activity  rather than a true decline in the value of the investment 
factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or tranche held by the company  a  the current collateral position of the tranche   the projected cash flows as of december   which indicate that the company will receive all contractual payments 
because the company does not intend to sell the investments and because it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity  the company does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  loans receivable  excluding loans held for sale  totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the million total at december  constriction of the lending environment resulting from national and local economic fears was somewhat lessened by strong refinancing activity during the first three quarters of conventional fixed rate loans for one to four family residential housing were refinanced and sold to fhlmc 
because of this  the bank experienced a decrease of in the conventional one to four family residential housing loan portfolio  from million as of december  to million at the same date in those conventional loans were refinanced as the bank originated million in loans to fhlmc growing the total of loans sold  but serviced by the bank  to million 
this was an increase of million  or over the december level of million 
other lending decreased or remained stable with the only increases seen in multi family lending million at december  as opposed to million at the same date in  an increase of  and a slight loan growth in commercial real estate and land growth from million to million  december  to december  
over the same period  interest receivable on interest earning assets increased by a minimal  or  demonstrating the effects of the drop in interest rates during most radically affected by the drops in the prime interest rate were commercial loans and home equity lines of credit which change directly with the prime rate 
the average yield on loans at december  was  a decrease of from the rate of at december  the bank s consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled approximately million for the year ended december   an overall increase from the million for the year ended december  the total allowance as a percent of loans outstanding increased to at december  as compared to 
for the same date in as the national economy worsened  the bank aggressively managed delinquencies  with overall delinquencies or more days past due as of december  at  compared to at the same date in non performing loans as of december  were million  compared to million at the same date in  and non performing loans as a percent of total loans were and 
respectively for those periods 
in anticipation of an unavoidable decline in the local economy  the bank increased its analysis of problem loans and established higher levels of specific reserves for potential losses 
net charge offs for the year ended december  were million as compared to  for the same period in the primary reason for this sharp increase period to period was the december partial charge off of million for amounts previously recorded as specific reserves for potential losses 
realized net charge offs for the year ended december  were  partial charge offs are based on estimated losses on loans still carried in the company s loan portfolio 
since these are estimates  final  realized charge offs on these loans  taken in subsequent periods  may result in additional charge off amounts  or recoveries of charged off amounts 
at december    of the allowance was specifically reserved for potential losses on identified loans 
no specfic reserves existed at december  comparing the portion of the allowance established for general reserves  period to period  the general reserve at december  was million as compared to million at the same point in  a period to period increase of million or 
see item business allowance for loan losses for additional information related to changes in the bank s charge off methodology 
while there was limited growth within certain loan types during  in aggregate the loan portfolio shrunk and there was no additional risk to the overall allowance for growth 
any risk due to growth in these economically challenging times was mitigated by selective underwriting of the borrower and in increasing requirements for amount and type of collateral securing the debt 
during the year ended december  the bank tightened collateral levels in all loan areas 
as an example  the bank held million in unsecured loans as of december   which was down from the million held at the same point in the bank is conservative in its lending practices and does not originate the type of loans publicized as sub prime and therefore does not anticipate delinquencies other than those normally associated with the economic trends of the bank s market areas 
as of december   those trends had stablized locally  with unemployment higher than at the same point in  but trending downward through the expense for the provision for loan losses increased to million in  an increase of over the provision expense of million 
this increase was primarily due to establishment of specific reserves  and subsequent partial charge off of that reserve  for a single large relationship  previously discussed in this document 
non performing loans defined as loans delinquent greater than days and loans on non accrual status totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
with the exception of a few loans delinquent due to administrative delays in refinancing  the bank s non performing loans represent loans in the lengthy process of foreclosure 
potential losses on these loans  as confirmed and adjusted for costs to sell  were charged off in december of  also as discussed earlier in this report 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
management is diligent in monitoring delinquent loans and in analyzing the factors affecting the allowance 
at december   the bank held two pieces of repossessed real estate valued at  as compared to three pieces with a combined value of  at december   and as of this report date was entertaining offers on both pieces of property  with no significant loss expected 
borrowings totaled million at december  versus million on december  of total borrowings  million and million represent fhlb advances with average rates of and at the respective dates 
rates on advances held by the bank average slightly more than over the highest paying certificate of deposit rate for the bank and more than over the average cost on existing certificates of deposit 
the reduction in borrowing levels contributed to the overall reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as of december  as opposed to at the same point in stockholders equity totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million total at december  the most significant factor in this increase was the sale by the company of  shares of preferred stock in november of  at  per share 
this is a restricted stock issue which carries a liquidation value of  per share and pays dividends quarterly to shareholders at a rate of per annum for the first five years 
after the fifth year  the rate increases to per annum and the company has the option to redeem the preferred stock in whole or part at a price equal to the sum of the liquidation amount per share and any accrued and unpaid dividends  regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared 
of the million raised through issuing the preferred stock  million was contributed to the bank and the remaining million was retained at the holding company level 
other factors contributing to the change in stockholders equity included dividends paid during the period of million  a net change in the unrealized loss position on available for sale securities of  and net income of million 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general river valley s net income for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of  or  from net income of million reported for the same period in the company benefited from decreasing costs of deposits and reduced costs on borrowing during the year  with net interest income of million as compared to the million at the same point in  an increase of  or 
additional benefits came from refinance activity encouraged by low interest rates and incentives to consumers  which resulted in strong loan sales in the secondary market  with the company originating and selling more than million in one to four family residential housing loans to the fhlmc 
gains on sales to fhlmc during the period ended december  were in excess of million  an increase of  or from the  of a year before 
such positive results were not enough  however  to stave off the effects of the increase in the provision for loan losses of million and the increased required contributions to the fdic insurance fund  which increased from  in to  in  an increase of nearly  a staggering 
the company persevered through prudent management of adminstrative costs and consistent non interest income  while maintaining acceptable capital levels and providing for losses through the allowance for loan losses 
with the decrease in net income  income tax expense decreased  with a drop in the effective tax rate from in to in  a dollar drop of  income from municipal investments held at the company s nevada subsidiaries and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance contributed to this drop in the effective tax rate as the percentage of non taxable income to total income increased 
net interest income total interest income for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  from the total 
the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year increased by million  or  with increases in loans receivable  investments  and interest earning deposits 
the average balance of loans receivable increased  or million  to  but due to lowering yields in as compared to for the year before  interest income from loans receivable decreased  from million for the year ending december  to million for the year ending december  with excess funds accumulating as deposits grew and lending tightened  the company placed a portion of those excess funds into investments  with the average balance of investments increasing million  from million in to million in this translated into a increase in interest income from investments  million for the period ended december  as compared to million for the same period ended comparative yields for investments were and  to  with the drop primarily being the result of the purchase of low yielding government agency investments  at the bank level  purchased for short term earnings and long term liquidity

interest earning deposits held by the company increased  period to period  with the average balance of those deposits being million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million or 
whereas in prior years this would have translated to additional earnings for the company  interest income on interest earning deposits fell from  for the period ended december  to  for the period ended december   as yields on those deposits fell from an average of in to in for the period ending december   total interest expense was million  a drop of million  or  from the million for the period ended december  interest expense for the company is comprised of interest on funds deposited with the company and expense on borrowings by the company 
the average of total deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or

during  overall delinquencies increased with non performing loans loans past due days or more increasing from the million as of december  to million at december   with the majority of these loans being in some step of foreclosure as of december  analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at june  determined that the company had potential losses for problem loans which required additional provision to the allowance for loan losses through the provision expense 
for the second quarter of  the company took million to the provision expense to reserve for these potential losses 
as a result of these actions  management recorded a million provision for losses on loans in  an increase of million  or  compared to the million provision recorded in in management s opinion  the bank s allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses from loans at december  however  there can be no assurance that regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan portfolio in the future  will not require increases in its allowances for loan losses or that changes in economic conditions will not adversely affect the bank s loan portfolio 
other income other income increased million from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   a total of 
this increase was fueled primarily by strong sales of one to four family residential loans to the secondary market and gains on the sale of investments offset by slight decreases in income from trust and wealth management services and elimination of the third party loan brokerage commissions seen in over the period the company originated over million in loans to the fhlmc freddie mac  with the total of loans sold with servicing retained increasing from million to million 
gains realized from the sales of freddie mac loans for the period ending december  was million  up  or  from the  for the same period ended december  associated income for origination of these loans was approximately  for as compared to  for the same period of costs associated with orignating these loans was approximately  for  as compared to  for the company realizes approximately  per year for servicing freddie mac loans  a significant part of other income 
gains on the sale of investments for the year ended december  were  up  or from the  recorded for the year ended december  these gains were realized as the company took advantage of gain positions on securities containing call provisions  expected to be fulfilled within the short term 
unlike interest income  other income is not always readily predictable and is subject to variations depending on outside influences 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the total 
costs associated with personnel  benefits  and occupancy costs decreased slightly as management emphasized cost containment and reduction in workforce through attrition 
nonetheless  while containing the overall cost of personnel  during the company added a second professional for business development in floyd and clark counties  indiana and a second dedicated loan review professional 
significant expense increases were experienced primarily in two areas 
due to the increased assessment by the fdic  the company expensed  for assessments for the period ending december  as compared to  for the same period in this was an  or  increase in fdic expense 
in connection with expanded regulatory reporting requirements  and the issuance of  shares of privately offered preferred stock  the company expensed  in professional fees for the period ended december   an increase of  or over the expensed amount for of  other expenses increased by  from  for the period ended december  to a total of million for the period of december  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with the origination and sale of loans to the fhlmc 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by  or  to a total of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the same period in the decrease in taxable income as a percent of total income  and the complementary increase in non taxable income as a percent of total income  was responsible for the decrease in the effective tax rate 
primary sources of non taxable income for the company are income from investments held by the bank s nevada subsidiary and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general river valley s net income for the year ended december   totaled million  an increase of  or  from net income of million reported for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to growth in interest earning assets  loans in particular  and improvement in the spread on interest bearing items  with net interest income increasing by year to year  and in non interest income  most specifically income from the gain on loan sales to the secondary market  which increased by over levels 
income tax expense decreased despite the overall increase in income  with a drop in the effective tax rate from in to in  a dollar drop of  income from municipal investments held at the company s nevada subsidiaries and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance contributed to this drop in the effective tax rate 
net interest income total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a slight decrease of  or  from the total 
the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year increased by million  but due to the dramatic decreases in interest rates during  the yield on those assets decreased from an average yield of in to in interest income on loans totaled million for  a slight increase of approximately  or  from the million reported for interest income on investments  fhlb stock and interest earning deposits decreased by  or 
while drops in the yields on these assets had some effect  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in the average balances of these assets 
total interest expense for the period ended december  exhibited significant declines with a decrease of million  or  from million at december   to million at december  interest expense on deposits alone decreased by million  or  to a total of million for the year ended december  this was due to the interest rates decreases  despite strong deposit growth over the period 
repricing of certificates of deposits  and growth in those types of deposits  fueled the overall rate decrease 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in fiscal interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  from resulting primarily from the increased average balances in fhlb advances for the year

as a result of such analysis  management recorded a million provision for losses on loans in  an increase of  or  compared to the  provision recorded in the current period provision generally reflects growth in the loan portfolio and management s analysis of the delinquency trends for the bank in view of the local real estate market and economy 
the increase in the provision year to year was predicated primarily on estimated losses with impact for the current local economic environment 
non performing loans for the period ended december  were million  a decrease of  or  from the million recorded as of fiscal year ended the decrease reflects the charge off of some long standing problem loans and aggressive management of past due accounts 
while management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate at december   there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to cover losses in the future 
management continues to be conservative in its underwriting  as discused above  in its classification of problem loans and in establishing realistic reserves for potential losses on loans 
as of december   the local economy remained relatively stable  as exhibited by employer activity and delinquency figures  despite grim national trends 
other income other income amounted to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to this increase was fueled primarily by sales of one to four family residential loans to the secondary market and gains on the sale of investments during the period offset by losses on sales of foreclosed property 
unlike interest income  other income is not always readily predictable and is subject to variations depending on outside influences 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the total 
increases in personnel and occupancy costs relative to the opening of the floyds knobs  indiana branch contributed to this increase  along with data processing costs relative to atm usage  and loan administration costs  which mirror loan growth and loan sales  and increases in the fdic assessment 
decreases in professional fees from the higher fees reported in which higher fees were a result of implementation of sarbanes oxley  as well as additional costs arising from the litigation described in part i  item  of this form k and in the amortization expense relative to servicing rights on mortgages sold to freddie mac fm due to declines in fm sales over the past three years offset some of the expense increase 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by  or  to a total of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the same period in the decrease continues to reflect the effect of tax exempt income from municipal investments held at the bank s nevada subsidiary  and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
average balance  yield  rate and volume data the following table presents certain information relating to river valley s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing annual income or expense by the average daily balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the years presented 
average balances are derived from daily balances  which include nonaccruing loans in the loan portfolio

interest rate spread is calculated by subtracting weighted average interest rate cost from weighted average interest rate yield for the period indicated 
the net yield on weighted average interest earning assets is calculated by dividing net interest income by weighted average interest earning assets for the period indicated 
rate volume table the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected river valley s interest income and expense during the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total changes in rate and volume 
the combined effects of changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be separately identified  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate year ended december  vs

as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  river valley financial is using the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its capital regulations 
presented on the following table is an analysis of river valley financial s interest rate risk  as of december  and december   as measured by changes in npv for an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of through basis points in market interest rates 
generally  npv is more sensitive to rising rates than declining rates 
such difference in sensitivity occurs principally because  as rates rise  a bank s assets reprice slower than the deposits that fund them 
as a result  in a rising interest rate environment  the amount of interest a bank would receive on loans would increase as loans are slowly prepaid and new loans at higher rates are made 
moreover  the interest the bank would pay on deposits would increase  but generally slower than the bank s ability to reprice its interest earning assets 
however  river valley financial bank has addressed some of these issues  which has generally reduced its overall exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent at december  and at december   the ots did not provide information as to interest rate risk for a point decrease 
as of december  they also did not provide information as to interest rate risk for a point decrease 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  maturities of securities  borrowings and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
the company maintains investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of the need for funds  expected deposit flows  the yield available on short term liquid assets and the objectives of the asset liability management program 
at december   the bank had commitments to originate loans totaling million and in addition  had undisbursed loans in process  unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
at such date  the bank had million in commitments to sell loans and no outstanding commitment to purchase loans 
ots regulations require the bank to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation 
the company considers the bank s liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet outstanding short and long term needs 
the company s liquidity  primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a result of the funds provided by or used in the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
these activities are summarized below for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities purchase of securities proceeds from maturities of securities proceeds from sales of securities net loan originations other cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in deposits net increase decrease in borrowings purchase of stock issuance of preferred stock other net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the bank is required by applicable law and regulation to meet certain minimum capital standards 
such capital standards include a tangible capital requirement  a core capital requirement  or leverage ratio  and a risk based capital requirement 
the tangible capital requirement requires savings associations to maintain tangible capital of not less than of the association s adjusted total assets 
tangible capital is defined in ots regulations as core capital minus intangible assets 
core capital is comprised of common shareholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual associations 
ots regulations require savings associations to maintain core capital generally equal to of the association s total assets except those associations with the highest examination rating and acceptable levels of risk 
ots regulations require that savings associations maintain risk based capital in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets 
risk based capital is defined as core capital plus certain additional items of capital  which in the case of the bank includes a general loan loss allowance of million at december  the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at december  the following table summarizes the bank s regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital at december  ots requirement actual amount percent of assets amount percent of assets amount amount of excess dollars in thousands tangible capital core capital risk based capital tangible and core capital levels are shown as a percentage of total assets  risk based capital levels are shown as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
the ots has proposed and is expected to adopt a core capital requirement for savings associations comparable to that adopted by the office of the comptroller of the currency for national banks 
the regulation requires core capital of at least of total adjusted assets for savings associations that received the highest supervisory rating for safety and soundness  and to for all other savings associations 
the bank is in compliance with this requirement 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to measure financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars with the exception of investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the rate of inflation 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this annual report on form k  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors
