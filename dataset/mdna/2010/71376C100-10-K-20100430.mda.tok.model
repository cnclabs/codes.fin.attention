item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management overview on august   we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock in exchange for the shares of model reorg  which merged into our wholly owned subsidiary  model reorg acquisition llc 
because the shares issued to the model reorg shareholders amounted to approximately of our shares outstanding after the issuance  the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition  and model reorg was treated as the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  our historical financial statements reflect the historical results of model reorg prior to the 
table of contents transaction date of august  and those of the combined companies beginning effective august   and the merger consideration was allocated among the fair values of e com s assets and liabilities as of the merger date 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company is continuing to use the same fiscal year end  the saturday closest to january  as e com used before the merger 
the company s net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of the results of the perfumania retail division for the full year in fiscal perfumania s sales rose modestly compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in the number of stores 
wholesale revenues decreased by from the prior period due primarily to the impact of the ongoing  global economic downturn and its resulting reduction in consumer spending 
a portion of the decrease was also due to the fact that fiscal s results included million of sales to e com before the merger 
principally because of the addition of perfumania s operating expenses for full year in fiscal  our operating expenses for fiscal  exclusive of million of charges for impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in fiscal  were million or approximately higher than those for the previous year 
excluding the charges for impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and expenses of perfumania s retail division  operating expenses decreased in fiscal by million or 
including million of interest expense  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared with net loss of million in fiscal excluding the million for impairment charges in fiscal  the net loss in fiscal was million 
the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  total net sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  asset impairments  sales returns and allowances  and other contingent assets and liabilities 
as such  some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
the judgments and estimates made can significantly affect results 
materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or by using different assumptions 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents accounts receivable  net of allowances in the normal course of business  we extend credit to wholesale customers that satisfy pre determined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  is net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through the analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on an evaluation of historical and anticipated trends  the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
should circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate significantly  we may need to increase our provisions 
inventory adjustments and writeoffs inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and potentially slow moving inventory based on prior sales  forecasted demand  historical experience and through specific identification of obsolete or damaged merchandise and we record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in accordance with our assessment 
if actual sales are less than our forecasts  additional writeoffs could be necessary 
inventory shrinkage is estimated and accrued between physical inventory counts 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
inherent in this process is significant management judgment as to the projected cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
judgments are also made as to whether under performing stores should be closed 
even if a decision has been made not to close an under performing store  the assets at that store may be impaired 
due in part to the deteriorating united states economy and resulting decline in retail sales which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company conducted an internal review of its long lived assets at the store level in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their projected future undiscounted cash flows 
the company then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their projected future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company conducted a similar review of its long lived assets at the store level in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
as the projection of future cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates  if actual results are materially different than these judgments or estimates  additional charges could be necessary 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
impairment of intangible assets the company s owned tradenames that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment 
the fair values are estimated and compared to their carrying values 
fair value is principally estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
trademarks  including tradenames and owned licenses having finite lives are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment 
the recoverability of the carrying values of all long lived assets with finite lives is re evaluated when changes in circumstances indicate the assets value may be impaired 
since the third quarter of fiscal  the capital markets experienced substantial volatility and the company s stock price declined substantially  causing the company s book value to exceed its market capitalization  plus a reasonable control premium 
in addition  the operating performance and cash flows of our retail and wholesale segments declined during the fourth quarter of fiscal accordingly  the company compared its market capitalization to the combined fair values of its reporting units and analyzed its 
table of contents future cash flow projections 
based on management s impairment review at january   we determined that goodwill was impaired in full and a portion of perfumania s tradename was impaired  and we recorded an impairment charge in fiscal there was no recorded goodwill as of january  based on management s impairment review at january   there was no impairment of trademarks or tradenames in fiscal we will continue to monitor the expected future cash flows of the company s reporting units and the long term market capitalization trends to assess the carrying values of the intangible assets 
further declines could result in additional impairment charges 
sales and allowances revenue from wholesale transactions is recorded when title passes 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and allowances 
revenue from retail sales is recorded  net of discounts  at the point of sale for perfumania stores  and for consignment sales  when sale to the ultimate customer occurs 
revenue from internet sales is recognized at the time products are delivered to customers 
we record an estimate of returns  discounts and allowances  and review and refine these estimates on a regular basis based on current experience and trends 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results  however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of deferred tax assets accounting guidance requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will not be realized 
the guidance also prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors 
the range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets is realizable 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected in calculating deferred tax assets could result in significant additional adjustments to our deferred tax assets and income tax expense 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year as discussed above  because the merger with model reorg was treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes  the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  fiscal include the results of the perfumania retail operations only for the period august  through january  however  we also provide information about perfumania s business during the period before august  to assist in understanding the trends in our current business  including comparisons between perfumania s fiscal and perfumania s fiscal net sales  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses 
furthermore  as a result of the merger  wholesale transactions between perfumania and model reorg that were previously recorded as affiliate transactions became intercompany transactions that are eliminated in consolidation 
net sales we recognized net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of from the million recorded in fiscal the breakdown of sales between retail and wholesale was as follows for the year ended in thousands january  percentage of sales january  percentage of sales percentage increase decrease retail wholesale total net sales 
table of contents excluding the sales from perfumania s retail division which are included in the above sales for all of the fiscal year ended january  but only from august  through january  in the prior year  net sales decreased by million or 
included in wholesale sales are million of pre merger sales to e com in fiscal which are not recognized following the merger 
the remaining decrease in wholesale sales of million is the result of the continuing tightening of credit resources generally  which decreases customers ability to purchase 
also  the reduction in consumer spending and the weak global economy caused wholesale customers to reduce their demand for fragrance during fiscal perfumania s retail sales for fiscal increased by to million compared to fiscal the average number of stores operated was in fiscal versus in the prior year  which contributed to the increase in retail sales 
however  perfumania s comparable store sales decreased by during fiscal comparable store sales measure sales from stores that have been open for one year or more 
we exclude stores that are closed for renovation from comparable store sales from the month during which renovation commences until the first full month after reopening 
the average retail price per unit sold during fiscal decreased from the prior year while the total number of units sold increased by 
we attribute the decrease in the average retail price per unit sold to increased promotional activity to drive sales 
the increase in the number of units sold was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated as well as the increased promotional activity 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise sold  inventory valuation adjustments  inventory shortages  damages and freight charges 
cost of goods sold increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the breakdown between wholesale and retail was as follows for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage increase decrease retail wholesale total cost of goods sold excluding the cost of goods sold for perfumania s retail division  which is included in the above cost of goods sold for all of fiscal but only the period from august  through january   in the prior year  cost of goods sold decreased by million or 
this decrease was due principally to the decrease in wholesale sales 
gross profit gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the breakdown between wholesale and retail was as follows for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage increase decrease retail wholesale total gross profit 
table of contents gross profit percentages for the same periods were for the year ended january  january  retail wholesale gross profit margin excluding the gross profit from perfumania which is included in the above gross profit information for all of fiscal but only from august  through january   in the prior year  gross profit decreased by million or 
excluding perfumania s results  the decrease in gross profit was due to the decrease in wholesale sales discussed above 
perfumania s retail gross profit for both fiscal and fiscal was million 
for these same periods  perfumania s retail gross margins were and  respectively 
the decrease in perfumania s retail gross margins was due to increased promotional activity in fiscal to drive sales 
operating expenses in fiscal  operating expenses increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal exclusive of impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as discussed below 
the increase is due principally to the addition of perfumania s operating expenses after the merger on august  selling  general and administrative expenses include payroll and related benefits for our distribution centers  sales  store operations  field management  purchasing and other corporate office and administrative personnel  rent  common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities for our stores  distribution centers and corporate office  advertising  consignment fees  sales promotion  insurance  supplies  freight out  and other administrative expenses 
the breakdown of operating expenses was as follows for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage increase decrease selling  general and administrative asset impairment depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the addition of perfumania s expenses following august  excluding perfumania s selling  general and administrative expenses  which are included for all of fiscal but only from august  through january   in the prior fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are expenses in connection with service agreements with quality king distributors  inc quality king  which were million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal these service agreements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
perfumania s selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by to million compared to million for the full fiscal year in while store occupancy costs increased due to the opening of net new stores over the past twenty four months  following the merger  certain corporate functions were relocated to the company s principal executive offices and distribution center in bellport  new york and these costs are not included in perfumania s selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal in addition  marketing expenses decreased in fiscal due to reduced spending on advertising 

table of contents there were no charges for impairment of goodwill  trademarks or tradenames in fiscal compared with non cash charges of approximately million for goodwill and million for tradename in fiscal at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  we conducted an internal review of the company s long lived assets at the store level and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
we then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in impairment charges of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the majority of the increase is attributable to including perfumania s retail division in the reported results for all of fiscal  versus only the period from august through january  in the prior fiscal year 
as a result of the foregoing  we recognized a net income from operations in fiscal of approximately million  compared to a net loss from operations in fiscal of million 
other expenses for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage increase interest expense interest expense was approximately million for fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes the combined company for the full fiscal year whereas the fiscal amount includes model reorg prior to the merger on august  and then the combined company for the remainder of the year 
overall  the interest rates on total variable interest debt increased by approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal income tax provision for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage decrease income tax provision we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider past taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
we performed a comprehensive review of the likely realization of these assets at january  and january   considering the then current broad economic environment and the challenges facing retailers for the foreseeable future 
at january  we concluded that it was necessary to record a valuation allowance equal to the full amount of our deferred tax assets  which was reflected as a non cash charge of million in the tax provision for fiscal in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowance by million 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
in both years  the effective tax rates differed from our federal statutory rates primarily due to the impact of recording the valuation allowances described above and non deductible expenses 

table of contents net loss as a result of the foregoing  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared to net loss of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal funding requirements are for inventory purchases  financing extended terms on accounts receivable  paying down accounts payable and debt  opening new stores and renovation of existing stores 
prior to the merger  model reorg also financed extended terms on accounts receivable from e com 
these capital requirements generally have been satisfied through borrowings under the respective revolving credit facilities and notes payable to affiliates 
the company has a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which general electric capital corporation gecc serves as agent  collateral agent and lender  ge capital markets  inc serves as joint lead arranger and book runner and wachovia capital markets serves as joint lead arranger the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is used for the company s general corporate purposes and those of its subsidiaries  including working capital 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are co borrowers under the senior credit facility  and the company s other subsidiaries have guaranteed all of their obligations thereunder 
the senior credit facility is scheduled to expire on august   when all amounts will be due and payable in full 
the senior credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid before maturity in whole or in part at the company s option without penalty or premium  provided that  if the company permanently reduces the revolving commitment in connection with a prepayment  on or before august   it must pay a prepayment fee equal to of the amount of such reduction  or after such date and on or before august   it must pay a prepayment fee equal to of the prepayment 
revolving loans under the senior credit facility may be drawn  repaid and reborrowed up to the amount available under a borrowing base calculated with reference to a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible accounts and a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible inventory from time to time 
gecc has the right to impose reserves in its reasonable credit judgment  whether or not there is an event of default  which would effectively reduce the borrowing base and thereby the amount that the borrowers may borrow under the senior credit facility 
under an amendment to the senior credit facility executed as of may  waiver and amendment no  reserves against borrowing availability increasing from million to million at august  and thereafter will automatically apply  in addition to any reserves that may be imposed from time to time in gecc s reasonable credit judgment 
the senior credit facility also includes a sub limit of million for letters of credit and a sub limit of million for swing line loans that is  same day loans from the lead or agent bank 
as a result of certain covenant defaults  which were waived by waiver and amendment no  effective january  through may   gecc elected to impose the default rate of interest on outstanding borrowings  which is higher than the interest rate otherwise applicable 
the company was also required to pay fees equal to of the unused amount of the senior credit facility and the outstanding amount of letters of credit under that facility 
under waiver and amendment no  interest under the senior credit facility for periods after may  are at the company s election unless an event of default exists  either i the highest of a the wall street journal prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus 
or c the sum of month libor plus the index rate  in each case plus or ii libor but not less than plus 
the company is also now required to pay fees equal to of the unused amount of the senior credit facility and of the outstanding amount of any letters of credit under that facility 
all obligations of the company under the senior credit facility and under any interest rate protection or other hedging arrangements entered into in connection with the senior credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all existing and after acquired personal property and owned real property owned by the company and its subsidiaries  which are co borrowers or guarantors  including  without limitation  or  in the case of excluded foreign subsidiaries  of the outstanding equity interests in their subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility limits the company s and its subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  incur liens or guarantee obligations  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and enter into joint ventures  dispose of assets  and engage in transactions with affiliates  except for certain existing arrangements under which the company leases space and obtains certain business services from affiliated companies and other arrangements in the ordinary course of business 
the senior credit facility also provides that short term advances to suppliers by the company and its subsidiaries may not exceed million with respect to all suppliers or million with respect to any one supplier together with its affiliates 

table of contents under the senior credit facility  the company and its subsidiaries have been required to maintain certain financial ratios  as specified in the agreement 
as the company was not in compliance with certain of these ratios as of november  and january   gecc imposed the default rate of interest on outstanding borrowings  as described above 
in order to better align the provisions of the senior credit facility with the company s current business situation  waiver and amendment no 
waived the covenant defaults and certain other defaults under the facility  provided for no testing of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  the inventory turnover ratio or the maximum leverage ratio covenants for the fiscal quarter ended may   deleted the inventory turnover ratio covenant and the maximum leverage ratio covenant thereafter  and suspended the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant until the fiscal quarter ending january  the company was in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the senior credit facility as of january  the senior credit facility also includes other customary events of default that  if not waived  would permit the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
any future defaults that are not waived could result in our having to refinance the senior credit facility and obtain an alternative source of financing 
due to the current weakness in the credit markets  there is no assurance that such financing would be obtained  or if such refinancing is obtained  that the terms of a new facility would be on terms comparable to the current senior credit facility 
if the company were unable to obtain such financing  its operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and it would be forced to seek an alternative source of liquidity  such as by selling additional securities  to continue operations  or to limit its operations 
at the closing of the merger  six estate planning trusts established by glenn  stephen and arlene nussdorf the nussdorf trusts loaned an aggregate of approximately million to the company on an unsecured basis 
at the same time  we issued an unsecured subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million to quality king 
glenn  stephen and arlene nussdorf are principal stockholders of the company  and quality king is wholly owned by them 
all of the subordinated promissory notes issued to the nussdorf trusts and quality king are subordinated to the senior credit facility and  pursuant to amendments as of may   no payments of principal or interest may be made before the maturity of the senior credit facility on august  the maturity date of the subordinated promissory notes payable to the nussdorf trusts is february  and that of the note payable to quality king is june  the nussdorf trust notes bear interest at a rate equal to over the rate in effect from time to time on the revolving loans under the senior credit facility  and the quality king note bears interest at a rate equal to over the rate in effect from time to time on the revolving loans under the senior credit facility 
quality king and the nussdorf trusts have acknowledged  by instruments dated as of march   that the company s nonpayment  because of the subordination provisions  of amounts otherwise due under these notes will not constitute a default under the notes 
on december   e com issued a subordinated convertible note the convertible note to glenn and stephen nussdorf in exchange for a million subordinated secured demand loan made in march the convertible note was originally secured by e com s assets  but  in connection with the august  financing transactions  glenn and stephen nussdorf released and terminated their security interest 
the convertible note was originally payable in january  however it was modified in january to extend the due date to january the convertible note is subordinate to all bank related indebtedness and  pursuant to a may  amendment  no payments of principal or interest may be made before the maturity of the senior credit facility on august  as a result  the convertible note is currently in default  resulting in an increase of in the nominal interest rate  which is the prime rate plus 
the convertible note allows glenn and stephen nussdorf to convert any or all of the principal and accrued interest due on the convertible note into shares of the company s common stock 
the conversion price was originally  which equaled the closing market price of e com s common stock on december   and was reduced to by the may  amendment 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared with approximately million used in operating activities during fiscal fiscal includes the results of the combined companies for the full year while fiscal includes activities for the combined companies beginning august  accounts receivable decreased in fiscal due to the decrease in sales to our wholesale customers 
inventories decreased due to management s efforts to maximize inventory turns and productivity and reduce overall retail store and distribution center inventory levels in fiscal the increase in accounts payable to both affiliates and non affiliates is due to the timing of payments to our vendors in fiscal our purchases from related parties e com before the merger and parlux fragrances  inc throughout the periods discussed are generally payable in days  however due to the seasonality of our business these terms are generally extended 
related party accounts have historically been brought closer to terms at the end of the holiday season 
during the rest of the year  the company has relied upon these extended terms to provide a portion of its liquidity 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily represented spending for renovation of existing stores  relocation of four existing stores 
table of contents and opening new perfumania stores 
in addition  during fiscal  we purchased three existing retail stores from an unrelated party for million 
at january   perfumania operated stores 
we plan to open approximately four stores in fiscal and plan to close approximately four stores 
we anticipate we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures  which will be used for perfumania new store construction and remodels  and information technology enhancements 
the decrease in investing activities when compared to fiscal was primarily related to significantly lower costs associated with new and remodeled perfumania stores 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions change 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was approximately million compared with net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal the fiscal increase in cash used in financing activities reflects the reduction in the balance of the bank line of credit as management increased inventory turns  reduced overall inventory levels and reduced capital expenditures in fiscal a summary of our cash flows for fiscal and fiscal is as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  summary cash flow information cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities decrease in cash cash at beginning of period cash at end of period based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash balances and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  our affiliated borrowings and our projected future operating results will generate sufficient liquidity to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service in the short and long term 
however  as discussed above  our bank lenders may reduce the amount of availability under the senior credit facility  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
they also would have the right to terminate our senior credit facility if we default on our covenants  which would require us to seek alternative financing in a highly unfavorable credit environment 
furthermore  the state of the national economy may worsen  which would further restrict customers ability to purchase fragrance products 
any of these circumstances  as well as any of the matters discussed in risk factors above  could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition  so there can be no assurance that management s plans and expectations will be successful
