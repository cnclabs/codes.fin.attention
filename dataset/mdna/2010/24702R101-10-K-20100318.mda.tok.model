competition we operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware  software  and service offerings and face on going product and price competition in all areas of our business from branded and generic competitors 
we compete based on our ability to offer profitable and competitive solutions to our customers that provide the most current and desired product features  as well as on customer service  quality  and reliability 
this is enabled by our direct relationships with customers  which allow us to recognize changing customer needs faster than many of our competitors 
this connection with our customers allows us to best serve customer needs and is one of our competitive advantages 
we are committed to balancing our mix of products and services to optimize profitability  liquidity  and growth 
we believe this strategy will help us achieve higher margins  but may put pressure on our industry unit share position for personal computers and servers at certain times 
sales and marketing we sell our products and services directly to customers through our online store at www 
dell 
com  dedicated sales representatives  telephone based sales  and through a variety of indirect sales channels 
our customers include large 
table of contents global and national corporate businesses  public institutions including government  education and healthcare organizations  and law enforcement agencies 
our customers also include small and medium sized businesses  individual customers  and retailers 
within each geographic region  we have divided our sales resources among these various customer groups 
no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated net revenue during any of the last three fiscal years 
our sales and marketing efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers 
our direct business model provides direct communication with our customers  thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customer groups 
customers may offer suggestions for current and future dell products  services  and operations on an interactive portion of our internet website called dell ideastorm 
this constant flow of communication allows us to rapidly gauge customer satisfaction and target new or existing products 
for large business and institutional customers  we maintain a field sales force throughout the world 
dedicated account teams  which include field based system engineers and consultants  form long term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance  develop specific tailored solutions for these customers  and provide us with customer feedback 
for large  multinational customers  we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with global account specialists  special global pricing  and consistent global service and support programs 
we also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeted at federal  state  and local governmental agencies  as well as healthcare and educational customers 
we market our products and services to small and medium sized businesses and consumers primarily by advertising on television and through the internet  advertising in a variety of print media  and mailing or emailing a broad range of direct marketing publications  such as promotional materials  catalogues  and customer newsletters 
we also sell our products and services through indirect sales channels 
in the us  we sell products indirectly through third party solution providers  system integrators  and third party resellers 
we also offer select consumer products in retail stores in several countries in the americas  europe  the middle east  and africa  which we refer to as emea  and asia pacific japan apj 
outside the us  we sell products indirectly through selected retailers to benefit from the retailer s existing end user customer relationships and valuable knowledge of traditional customs and logistics in the country and to mitigate credit and country risk as well as because sales in some countries may be too small to warrant a direct sales business unit 
our goal is to have strategic relationships with a number of major retailers in larger geographic regions 
during fiscal  we continued to expand our global retail presence  and we now reach over  retail locations worldwide 
our retailers include best buy  staples  wal mart  dsgi  gome  and carrefour  among others 
patents  trademarks  and licenses at january   we held a worldwide portfolio of  patents and had an additional  patent applications pending 
we also hold licenses to use numerous third party patents 
to replace expiring patents  we obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities 
the inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system products  manufacturing processes  and related technologies 
our product  business method  and manufacturing process patents may establish barriers to entry in many product lines 
while we use our patented inventions and also license them to others  we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 
we have entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross licensing agreements 
we have also entered into various software licensing agreements with other companies 
we anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry 
we have obtained us federal trademark registration for the dell word mark and the dell logo mark 
we own registrations for of our other marks in the us at january   we had pending applications for registration of other trademarks 
we believe that establishment of the dell word mark and logo mark in the us is material to our operations 
we have also applied for or obtained registration of the dell word mark and several other marks in approximately other countries 

table of contents from time to time  other companies and individuals assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are important to the technology industry or our business 
we evaluate each claim relating to our products and  if appropriate  seek a license to use the protected technology 
the licensing agreements generally do not require the licensor to assist us in duplicating its patented technology  nor do these agreements protect us from trade secret  copyright  or other violations by us or our suppliers in developing or selling these products 
government regulation and sustainability government regulation our business is subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies 
such regulation includes the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the us federal communications commission  the anti trust regulatory activities of the us federal trade commission  the us department of justice  and the european union  the consumer protection laws and financial services regulations of the us federal trade commission and various state governmental agencies  the export regulatory activities of the us department of commerce and the us department of treasury  the import regulatory activities of us customs and border protection  the product safety regulatory activities of the us consumer product safety commission  the investor protection and capital markets regulatory activities of the securities and exchange commission  and the environmental  employment and labor  and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business 
we were not assessed any material environmental fines  nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs  during fiscal sustainability environmental stewardship and social responsibility are both integral parts of how we manage our business  and complement our focus on business efficiencies and customer satisfaction 
we use open dialogue with our stockholders  customers  vendors  and other stakeholders as part of our sustainability governance process where we take candid feedback and offer honest discussions on the challenges we face globally 
our environmental initiatives take many forms  including maximizing product energy efficiency  reducing and eliminating sensitive materials from our products  and providing responsible  convenient computer recycling options for customers 
we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our operations 
we have set business requirements for our suppliers to disclose and reduce their greenhouse gas  or ghg  impacts 
we were the first company in our industry to offer a free worldwide recycling program for our consumers 
we also provide consumers with no charge recycling of any brand of computer or printer with the purchase of a new dell computer or printer 
we have streamlined our transportation network to reduce transit times  minimize air freight and reduce emissions 
our packaging is designed to minimize box size and to increase recycled content of materials along with recyclability 
when developing and designing products  we select materials guided by a precautionary approach in which we seek to eliminate environmentally sensitive substances where reasonable alternatives exist from our products and work towards developing reliable  environmentally sound  and commercially scalable solutions 
we also have created a series of tools that help customers assess their current it operations and uncover ways to reduce both the costs of those operations and their impact on the environment 
backlog we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of net revenue that can be expected for any period 
the backlog at any point in time may not translate into net revenue in any subsequent period  as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer 
our business model generally gives us flexibility to manage backlog at any point in time by expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders toward products that have shorter lead times  thereby reducing backlog and increasing current period revenue 
although backlog at the end of fiscal was higher than at the end of fiscal and fiscal  the difference was not material when compared to our annual revenue during fiscal

item a risk factors our business  operating results  financial condition and prospects are subject to a variety of significant risks  many of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or desire 
weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may harm our business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability 
we are a global company with customers in virtually every business and industry 
our performance depends significantly on global economic conditions 
commercial customers and consumers may postpone spending amid concerns over reduced asset values  fluctuating energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  unemployment  and the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses  and sovereign nations 
weak global economic conditions could have a number of adverse effects on our business  including weaker customer demand  potential insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products on favorable terms  and potential customer insolvencies  all of which could negatively impact our liquidity and ultimately decrease our net revenue and profitability 

table of contents weak economic conditions and additional regulation could harm our financial services activities 
our financial services activities are negatively affected in the current adverse economic environment by loan delinquencies and defaults 
although the trend of increasing loan delinquencies and defaults has slowed  defaults impact our net credit losses and we may need to increase our reserves for customer receivables in the future 
in addition  anticipated changes in financial services regulation could unfavorably impact the profitability and cash flows of our consumer financing activities 
we face intense competition  which may adversely affect our industry unit share position  revenue  and profitability 
we operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware  software and service offerings  and face aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors 
we compete based on our ability to profitably offer competitive solutions with the most current and desired product features  as well as on customer service  quality and reliability 
we expect that competition will continue to be intense and that our competitors products may be less costly  provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products 
our efforts to balance our mix of products and services to optimize profitability  liquidity  and growth may also put pressure on our industry unit share position in the short term 
as we continue to expand globally  we may see new and increased competition in different geographic regions 
in addition  barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost 
if our cost cutting measures are not successful  we may become less competitive 
a variety of factors could prevent us from achieving our goal of better aligning our product and service offerings and cost structure with customer needs in the current business environment 
we are currently focused on reducing our operating expenses  reducing total costs in procurement  product design  transformation  and simplifying our structure 
for example  we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings plans and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement the plans 
as a result  we may not achieve our expected cost savings in the time anticipated  or at all 
in such case  our results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted  making us less competitive and potentially causing us to lose industry unit share 
our inability to effectively manage product and services transitions could reduce the demand for our products and the profitability of our operations 
continuing improvements in technology result in frequent new product and services introductions  short product life cycles  and improvements in product performance characteristics 
in addition  we are increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through our contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies  deliver products faster and better serve our customers in certain segments and geographical areas 
the success of product transitions depends on a number of factors  including the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet demand  and the risk that new or upgraded products have quality or other defects 
these product transitions present execution challenges and risks 
if we are unable to effectively manage a new product transition  our business and results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
we may not successfully execute our growth strategy if we fail to effectively manage the growth of our distribution capabilities  and to add to the scope of our product and services offerings 
our growth strategy involves reaching more customers worldwide through new distribution channels  such as consumer retail  expanding our relationships with value added resellers  and augmenting select areas of our business through targeted acquisitions 
as we reach more customers worldwide through an increasing number of new distribution channels  such as consumer retail  and continue to expand our relationships with value added resellers  inventory management becomes more challenging and successful demand forecasting becomes more difficult 
our goal continues to be to optimize the balance of liquidity  profitability  and growth with a focus on moving the weight of the product portfolio to higher margin products and recurring revenue streams 
our ability to grow sales of these higher margin products  services 
table of contents and solutions depends on our ability to successfully transition our sales capabilities in accordance with our strategy and to add to the breadth of our higher margin offerings through selective acquisitions of other businesses 
if we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our distribution capabilities and grow our product and services offerings  our business and results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
if we fail to achieve favorable pricing from our vendors  our profitability could be adversely impacted 
our profitability is affected by our ability to achieve favorable pricing with our vendors and contract manufacturers  including through negotiations for vendor rebates  marketing funds  and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business 
because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the ongoing competitive environment  the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect our profitability 
these vendor programs may change periodically  potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends 
our inability to establish a cost and product advantage  or determine alternative means to deliver value to our customers  may adversely affect our industry unit share position  revenue  and profitability 
our reliance on vendors for products and components  many of whom are located outside the us  could harm our business by adversely affecting product delivery  reliability and cost 
we obtain many of our products and all of our components from third party vendors 
in addition  we are continuing to expand our use of contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcers 
while these relationships generate cost efficiencies  they reduce our direct control over production 
our manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies give us the ability to operate with reduced levels of component and finished goods inventories 
our increasing reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages  and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products  as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs 
because we maintain minimal levels of component and product inventories  a disruption in component or product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs 
in addition  defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation 
we could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays  or inefficiencies if we are unable to procure in a timely and reliable manner components and products from single source or limited source suppliers 
we maintain several single source or limited source supplier relationships  either because multiple sources are not available or because the relationships are advantageous to us due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity  or price considerations 
if the supply of a critical single or limited source product or component is delayed or curtailed  we may not be able to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner 
even where multiple sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could harm our operating results 
we may not successfully implement our acquisition strategy 
we acquire companies as a part of our overall growth strategy 
these acquisitions may involve significant new risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management attention away from our current business operations  insufficient new revenue to offset expenses  inadequate return of capital  integration challenges  new regulatory requirements  and issues not discovered in our due diligence process 
as a result  such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability or operations 
in addition  if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations  we may be forced to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles  which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating performance 
our ability to generate substantial non us net revenue faces many additional risks and uncertainties 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal our future growth rates and success are dependent on continued growth of our business outside the us  including in the key developing countries of brazil  russia  india  and china 
our international operations face many risks and uncertainties  including varied local economic and labor conditions  political 
table of contents instability  and changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws including us taxes on foreign operations  copyright levies  and foreign currency exchange rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
our profitability may be adversely affected by our product  customer  and geographic sales mix and by seasonal sales trends 
our profit margins vary among products  customers  and geographic markets 
in addition  our business is subject to certain seasonal sales trends 
for example  sales to government customers particularly the us federal government are typically stronger in our third fiscal quarter  sales in emea are often weaker in our third fiscal quarter  and consumer sales are typically strongest during our fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result of these factors  our overall profitability for any particular period may be adversely affected by the mix of products  customers  and geographic markets reflected in our sales for that period  as well as by seasonal trends 
our business is dependent on our ability to access the capital markets 
we are increasingly dependent on access to debt and capital sources to provide financing for our customers and to obtain funds in the us for general corporate purposes  including working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  funding customer receivables  and share repurchases 
additionally  we have customer financing relationships with companies whose business models rely on accessing the capital markets 
the inability of these companies to access such markets could force us to self fund transactions or forego customer financing opportunities  potentially harming our financial performance 
the debt and capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption from time to time in the future  resulting in higher credit spreads in the capital markets and higher funding costs for us 
the cost of accessing debt and capital markets has increased in recent periods as many lenders and institutional investors require higher rates of return 
lenders have also tightened lending standards  and reduced or ceased their lending to certain borrowers 
deterioration in our business performance  a credit rating downgrade  volatility in the securitization markets  changes in financial services regulations or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in debt availability and could limit our ability to continue asset securitizations or other financings from debt or capital sources  reduce the amount of financing receivables that we originate  or negatively affect the costs or terms on which we may be able to obtain capital  any of which could unfavorably affect our net revenue  profitability  and cash flows 
loss of government contracts could harm our business 
contracts with the us government and foreign governments are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs and are subject to the right of the government to terminate for convenience or non appropriation 
in addition  if we violate legal or regulatory requirements  the applicable government could suspend or disbar us as a contractor  which would unfavorably affect our net revenue and profitability 
the exercise by customers of certain rights under our services contracts  or our failure to perform as we anticipate at the time we enter services contracts  could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
many of our services contracts allow the customer to terminate the contract if our performance does not meet specified service levels request a rate reduction tied to a benchmarker s opinion of market rates or alternatively allow the customer to terminate the contract reduce the customer s use of our services and  as a result  reduce our fees terminate the contract early upon payment of an agreed fee 
these customer actions may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
in addition  we estimate our costs to deliver the services at the outset of the contract 
if we fail to estimate accurately  our actual costs may significantly exceed our estimates  even for a time and materials contract  and we may incur losses on the services contracts 

table of contents our performance could be adversely affected by our failure to hedge effectively our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we utilize derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements 
if we are not successful in monitoring our foreign exchange exposures and conducting an effective hedging program  our foreign currency hedging activities may not offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our future results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to counterparty default risks 
we enter into numerous financing arrangements  including foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts  with a wide array of bank counterparties 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts will default  either voluntarily or involuntarily  on its performance under the contract 
in times of market distress  a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice to us  and we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure  either because we lack the contractual ability or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action 
in the event of a counterparty default  we could incur significant losses  which could harm our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in the event that one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  our ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding 
in addition  our deposits at financial institutions are at risk 
unfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm our business and result in substantial costs 
we are involved in various claims  suits  investigations  and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business and that are not yet resolved  including those described elsewhere in this report 
additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve stockholder  consumer  antitrust  tax and other issues on a global basis 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
regardless of the merit of the claims  litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to our business 
therefore  we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect our operating results or cash flows in a particular period 
for example  we could be exposed to enforcement or other actions with respect to the continuing sec investigation into certain accounting and financial reporting matters 
in addition  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions 
our business could suffer if we do not obtain licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms 
if we or our suppliers are unable to obtain desirable technology licenses  we may be prevented from marketing products  could be forced to market products without desirable features  or could incur substantial costs to redesign products  defend legal actions  or pay damages 
although our suppliers might be contractually obligated to obtain such licenses and indemnify us against such expenses  those suppliers could be unable to meet their obligations 
in addition  our operating costs could increase because of copyright levies or similar fees by rights holders and collection agencies in european and other countries 
the expiration of tax holidays or favorable tax rate structures  or unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and other tax compliance matters  could result in an increase of our effective income tax rate in the future 
portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part during fiscal through fiscal many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met  or terminated if certain conditions are not met 
if they are not extended  or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate  then our effective tax rate would increase in the 
table of contents future 
our effective tax rate could also increase if our geographic sales mix changes 
we are under audit in various tax jurisdictions 
an unfavorable outcome in certain of these matters could result in a substantial increase to our tax expense 
in addition  changes in tax laws including us taxes on foreign operations could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
we face risks relating to any inability by us to maintain strong internal controls 
if management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment  we could have weaknesses in our control environment  causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
this could lead to a decline in our stock price  limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future  and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures 
current environmental and safety laws  or laws enacted in the future  may harm our business 
our operations are subject to environmental and safety regulation in all of the areas in which we conduct business 
our product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to the materials composition  energy efficiency and collection  recycling  treatment  transportation and disposal of our electronics products  including restrictions on mercury  lead  cadmium  lithium metal  lithium ion and other substances 
if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the transportation  use and sale of such regulated substances  we could be subject to liability 
the costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict  but could have an unfavorable impact on our business 
armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues could harm our business 
armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad  could cause damage or disruption to us  our suppliers or customers  or could create political or economic instability  any of which could harm our business 
these events could cause a decrease in demand for our products  could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or for our suppliers to deliver components  and could create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 
infrastructure disruptions or breaches of data security could harm our business 
we depend on our information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve our business objectives 
if a disruption  such as a computer virus  natural disaster  failure of a manufacturing or telecommunications system  lost connectivity  or intentional tampering or data breach by a third party impairs our infrastructure  we may be unable to receive or process orders  manufacture and ship products in a timely manner  or otherwise conduct our business as usual 
a disruption could cause us to lose customers and revenue  particularly during a period of disproportionately heavy demand  and could result in the unintentional disclosure of company or customer information and could damage our reputation 
we also could incur significant expense in remediating these problems and in addressing related data security and privacy concerns 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate our key employees 
we rely on key personnel to support anticipated continued rapid international growth and increasingly complex product and service offerings 
we may not be able to attract  retain  and motivate the key professional  technical  marketing  and staff resources we need
