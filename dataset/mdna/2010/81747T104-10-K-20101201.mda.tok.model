item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in risk factors in item a 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products we develop  manufacture and sell biological products essential for the development  manufacture and use of diagnostic tests and the discovery  development and production of pharmaceuticals and other commercial products 
our customers depend on us for a reliable supply of products with exacting specifications that meet stringent fda and other regulatory standards 
our products business has two primary product groups controls and panels for clinical laboratories  blood banks and ivd manufacturers  and reagents and bioprocessing products for use in the discovery  development and manufacturing processes for drugs  vaccines and diagnostic tests 
controls and panels our diagnostic control and panel products are sold to hospital laboratories  independent clinical laboratories  public health laboratories  blood banks  ivd manufacturers and government regulatory and research agencies 
hospital  clinical and public health labs use our quality control products to ensure the accuracy of tests used to detect markers of disease or monitor infection rates 
our control and panel products make it possible for clinical labs testing for infectious diseases to evaluate tests and to independently monitor the quality and precision of test results 
for blood banks and transplant centers  use of quality control products helps to ensure blood and organ safety 
we believe our controls and panels have led the market for quality control and evaluation of infectious disease test methods for over a decade and we are expanding this product line into the market for controls and panels for genetic and cancer marker tests 
in the years ended september   and  revenue for our control and panel products was million  million and million  respectively 
our control and panel products are also used for employee training and competency assessment programs 
laboratory testing for viruses that cause disease requires highly complex techniques that are frequently revised and improved 
laboratory regulations and good practice require that newly hired technicians must undergo training on test methods and existing personnel must undergo annual competency assessments on each laboratory test they perform 
the clinical laboratories improvement act of clia  for example  requires that laboratories maintain records of their employee training and competency assessment activities 
controls also called quality controls are samples designed to be similar to patient samples and are sold to laboratories so that a known sample can be tested when a diagnostic test is run 
control results are monitored over time to track test results and ensure their consistent performance 
the use of controls with clinical lab tests is mandated by regulatory agencies in much of the developed world 
panels are also designed to be similar to patient samples 
panels include a data sheet and a set of samples that are related in some way 
for example  they may all be positive for the same marker of hcv or may all be from the same donor at different points in time in the progression of their infection 
these panels have high and lasting value because the samples they contain are highly characterized and can be used to establish a consistent reference point 
the same panel can be purchased repeatedly and used to build a record of improving test sensitivity and specificity over time as new methods are developed 
ivd manufacturers  regulatory agencies and researchers use our panels to develop and evaluate new tests and look for new markers of disease 
we currently offer over control and panel products for infectious diseases including hiv  hepatitis a  hbv  hcv  west nile virus  chagas and hpv  that are widely used around the world and we offer over ce marked products 
most of our control products are sold under the accurun brand name 
reagents and bioprocessing products our reagents and bioprocessing products are used by diagnostic  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations in industry and academia

our diagnostic intermediates are plasma derived products used by manufacturers of diagnostic test kits in every stage of the product life cycle  including research and development  pilot production  clinical trials  regulatory submission  full production and commercialization 
these products include human disease state plasma  normal human serum or plasma and basematrix  seracon or matribase  which are clear  stable and economical substitutes for normal human plasma or serum 
we also provide bovine serum albumin which can function as a carrier or stabilizer for other proteins in diagnostic test components 
other seracare human and animal sera products are used in clinical or veterinary laboratory tests as positive and negative controls 
critical raw materials such as diluents  plasma and blood or blood components from individuals with any of a number of specific diseases are a specialty of our diagnostic intermediates group 
our expertise in processing blood products yields consistent results and allows our manufacturing customers to concentrate on test method development and production and distribution of test kits 
cell culture products are the media and media supplements that maintain viability of specific cells 
our cell culture products include sera  cell and tissue culture media and other reagents that are used for both research activities and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes 
our biological test components and purified human cells include materials used in the development and evaluation of biologics products  the characterization of chemical structures  the development of formulations for long term solution stability and the validation of purification processes 
our cell culture products support the growth of cells used in the manufacture of large molecule therapeutics  including monoclonal antibodies and other proteins grown in bacteria  yeast or mammalian cells 
bioservices biobanking we manage and store approximately million biological samples at our state of the art facilities in maryland pursuant to multi year contracts with government agencies and private sector customers  who pay for these services on either a cost plus  fixed price  or time and materials basis 
under the cost plus contracts  a majority of the equipment cost is passed through directly to the customer 
we also provide research and clinical trial support services including assisting with collecting  cataloging  processing  transporting  cryopreservation  storing and tracking of samples collected during research studies and clinical trials 
in addition  we provide technical support and training to collaborators and investigators on issues related to specimen processing and handling

our virology services group performs viral cultivations  infectivity testing  in vitro characterization of anti hiv drugs 
our immunology group provides services for the assessment of cell mediated immunity  including enzyme linked immunospot elispot  apoptosis and complement fixation assays  and administers proficiency programs for network laboratories that perform similar types of assays 
our molecular biology group provides services in dna and rna isolations from blood and other clinical specimens  polymerase chain reaction amplifications  dna cloning  gene mapping  sequencing  genotyping and linkage analysis 
our biochemistry group provides protein purification services and coagulation testing services 
these services are usually conducted under contracts which range from a few months to multi year commitments and are structured on a cost plus  time and materials or fixed price basis 
product development our research scientists work closely with sales  marketing  manufacturing  quality  regulatory and finance personnel to identify and prioritize the development of new products and services specifically geared to customer needs and consistent with our business priorities 
product launch involves careful coordination among product development  manufacturing  quality assurance  sales and marketing departments to ensure the final product is produced in accordance with specifications and meets customer requirements 
we develop ivd and immunology reagents and enabling technologies for our life science customers to use in the discovery  development and manufacture of their diagnostic and therapeutic products 
within ivd we are developing reagents and enabling technologies for use in our contract services and manufacturing business  diagnostic quality controls and panels for emerging infectious disease  genetic and oncology markers and expression systems for control template packaging and recombinant protein production 
immunology projects include the development of purified fresh and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell based products and selected subpopulations of these cells  extensions to our existing reagent product lines and service capabilities  and developing new antibody  cytokine and research target reagents 
our human and animal derived biologic sourcing acumen supplemented by our manufacturing  virology  immunology and molecular biology expertise allows us to develop value added reagents and enabling technologies that serve to accelerate and enhance the quality  consistency and scalability of our life science customers research  development and manufacturing activities 
in the years ended september   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on our research and development activities 
suppliers while there are some materials that we obtain from a single supplier  we are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers for our business as a whole 
raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers 
our normal contract terms are fob our dock with payment terms of days 
sales and distribution we sell most of our products and services through our direct sales force  although we use distributors in approximately countries to market and sell our products in international markets 
these independent distributors may also market products of other companies  including some products that are competitive with our products 
as of september   we employed people worldwide in our sales  customer service and marketing organizations 
our sales strategy is to employ technical sales representatives who have an extensive background in the life sciences industry 
a thorough knowledge of biological techniques and an understanding of the research process allow our sales representatives to become advisors  acting in a consultative role with customers 
our use of skilled technical sales representatives also enables us to identify evolving market needs and new technologies that we can license and develop into new products 
customers customers of our diagnostic control and panel products include hospital laboratories  independent clinical laboratories  public health laboratories  blood banks  ivd manufacturers and regulatory agencies that oversee the manufacture and use of such test kits 
customers of our reagents and bioprocessing products include diagnostic  pharmaceutical and biotechnology product developers and manufacturers as well as research laboratories affiliated with government  academia and private foundations 
customers of our services include government and academic institutions  ivd manufacturers and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
for the year ended september   our top five customers accounted for of our revenue and our largest two customers  national institutes of health nih and roche molecular systems accounted for and of revenue  respectively 
no other customer individually accounted for more than of revenue in that period 
discontinued operations on march   we sold certain assets and liabilities of our genomics collaborative division to bioserve biotechnologies limited bioserve 
the genomics collaborative division involved the sale of human clinical specimens and their accompanying medical information for use in drug discovery 
the consideration for this sale consisted of million cash and a royalty on bioserve s net sales related to the business of the genomics collaborative division for five years through march  during the years ended september  and  we received million and million  respectively  related to the royalties 
domestic and foreign sales one of our principal marketing strategies has been to target international markets  including europe  asia  canada and other parts of the world 
most of our international order processing  invoicing  collection and customer service functions are handled directly from our headquarters in massachusetts 
we believe demand for our products in international markets is primarily driven by increased use of quality control products and the development  validation and use of new diagnostic tests 
in fiscal  of our revenue  or million  was attributable to international sales  of which was from sales to europe  was from sales to asia  and was from sales to canada 
in fiscal and  and  respectively  of our revenue were attributable to international sales 
the increase in international sales from fiscal to fiscal is a result of an increased focus on foreign markets 
during the last three years  less than of our assets have been located outside the united states 
licensing arrangements we have an exclusive license agreement which provides the know how to manufacture certain genetic controls 
we have royalty obligations under this agreement 
we expensed million in total under this agreement on net sales generated during the fiscal year ended september  we have two non exclusive licensing agreements with the nih 
these agreements provide us with access to certain nih cell lines that are used in the manufacture of certain bulk  control or panel products 
we have royalty obligations under each of these agreements 
we expensed less than million in total to the nih under the two agreements on net sales generated during the fiscal year ended september  we also have a non exclusive licensing agreement with millipore corporation under which millipore pays for the use of hybridoma cell lines that are proprietary to us 
the cell lines generate monoclonal antibodies used in millipore s products 
under the agreement  millipore is obligated to pay us of net sales generated by related products 
we received approximately million from millipore under this agreement during the fiscal year ended september  during the year ended september   millipore was purchased by merck kgaa 
intellectual property we rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to preserve our competitive position 
we rely primarily on know how in many of our manufacturing processes and techniques not generally known to other life sciences companies for developing and maintaining our market position 
we rely on trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property rights pertaining to our products  technology and clinical research data 
we have trademarks registered in the united states and a number of other countries for use in connection with our products and business 
we believe that many of our trademarks are generally recognized in our industry 
such trademarks include accurun and seracare 
regulatory environment regulation of health care industry the health care industry is highly regulated  and state and federal health care laws and regulations are applicable to certain aspects of our business and that of our customers 
for example  there are federal and state health care laws and regulations that apply to the operation of clinical laboratories  the provision of health care services by providers using our products and services  business relationships between health care providers and suppliers  the privacy and security of health information and the conduct of clinical research 
regulation of products the design and manufacturing of many of our products is regulated by numerous third parties  including the fda  foreign governments  independent standards auditors and our customers 
in the united states  ivd and biological products have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies  primarily as to product safety  efficacy  manufacturing  advertising  labeling  import  export and safety reporting 
the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the fda through its center for devices and radiological health and its center for biological evaluation and research continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation for fda clearance of current and new ivd and biologic products 
we have over products that are ivd labeled 
the fda can ban certain ivd and biological products  detain or seize adulterated or misbranded ivd and biological products  order repair  replacement or refund of these products  and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to ivd and biological products that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health 
the fda may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food  drug and cosmetic act  the safe medical device act or the public health service act pertaining to ivd and biological products or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations 
our products sold in europe for blood and diagnostic testing are ce marked 
ce marking is a manufacturer s declaration that the product is in compliance with the essential health and safety requirements set out in european directives 
ce marking allows the product to be legally placed on the market in the participating country and ensures a product s free movement within the european union 
we offer over ce marked products 
regulation of laboratory operations we operate a clinical laboratory at our gaithersburg  maryland facility 
clinical laboratories that perform laboratory testing except for research purposes only on human subjects are subject to regulation under clia 
clia regulates clinical laboratories by requiring that the laboratory be certified by the federal government  licensed by the state and comply with various operational  personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical laboratory test results are accurate  reliable and timely 
state law and regulations also apply to the operation of clinical laboratories 
although we do not engage in significant laboratory testing for purposes other than research  we maintain a clia certification at the gaithersburg  maryland facility and our laboratories are subject to regulation under state law 
environmental we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local environmental protection measures 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
our compliance with these regulations did not have during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  cash flows  earnings or competitive position 
occupational safety and health administration osha as with most operating companies  our manufacturing facilities must comply with both federal and state osha regulations 
we maintain all required records 
osha inspects operating locations as it deems appropriate and generally does so without advance notice 
state governments most states in which we operate have regulations that parallel federal regulations 
most states conduct periodic unannounced inspections and require licensing under such state s procedures 
competitors the segments of the life sciences industry in which we compete are highly fragmented 
within our product and service areas  we face varying levels of competition 
in certain instances  we compete with large  well capitalized life science companies  which have significant financial  operational  sales and marketing  and research and development resources 
in other instances  our competition comes from small  independent companies that focus on particular niches within our segments 
we compete primarily on quality  breadth of product line and service 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products our primary competitors in the controls and panels business include acrometrix now part of life technologies corporation  zeptometrix corporation and bio rad laboratories  inc within the reagents and bioprocessing products business  we compete with other companies  such as millipore now merck kgaa  invitrogen corporation now part of life technologies corporation  thermo fisher scientific  inc  baxter healthcare corporation and grifols sa  that supply biologics to support the development and manufacture of diagnostic assays  biopharmaceutical products and vaccines  as well as with small private companies  which source human disease state plasma 
bioservices in our biobanking division  we compete with thermo fisher scientific  inc and other companies that maintain biorepositories for commercial organizations  government and academic institutions as well as companies  government agencies and academic institutions that internally maintain their own repository for biological materials 
employees as of september   we had employees  of which were full time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements 
chapter reorganization on december   the company reported that it was unable  without unreasonable effort and expense  to file its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  within the prescribed time period which triggered the notice of default and acceleration of debt from our senior secured lenders and the cross default of another secured debt facility 
the default was due to the violation of certain financial covenants and the failure to deliver annual audited financial statements on a timely basis 
the company was unable to reach an agreement with its senior lenders  union bank of california and brown brothers harriman co  and was forced to seek bankruptcy protection to allow time to work out agreements with its secured and unsecured creditors under the supervision of the bankruptcy court 
on march   the company filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of california 
subsequently  the bankruptcy court allowed the company to operate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code  the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and the orders of the bankruptcy court 
the company emerged from bankruptcy protection under the joint plan of reorganization the plan of reorganization which was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on february  and which  after each of the conditions precedent to the consummation was satisfied or waived  became effective may  under the plan of reorganization  the company raised million million net of issuance costs through a rights offering  which allowed it to pay off all its creditors in full and exit bankruptcy under the ownership of its existing shareholders and provided for the settlement of its alleged liabilities in a previously filed shareholders class action lawsuit

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this annual report 
our business  financial condition  and operating results could be seriously harmed if any of these risks materialize 
the trading price of our common stock may also decline due to any of these risks 
risks related to our business quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and we may fail to meet investor expectations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results include the following changes in demand for our products and services  and the ability to obtain the required resources to satisfy customer demand on a cost effective basis or even to attain the required resources at all  ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products or services in a timely manner  changes in our sales and marketing organization  including changes of sales and marketing management  ability to manage inventories  accounts receivable and cash flows  changes in applicable regulatory requirements  ability to control costs  and overall market conditions 
the amount of expenses incurred depends  in part  on expectations regarding future revenue 
in addition  since many expenses are fixed in the short term  we cannot significantly reduce expenses if there is a decline in revenue to avoid losses 
our principal shareholders may exert significant influence on us 
as of september   the combined group of jacob safier and ltova holdings llc  whom we refer to collectively as ltova  ashford capital management inc  black horse capital and t rowe price associates  inc 
had publicly reported that they were beneficial owners of approximately   and  respectively  of our common stock 
these shareholders can exert significant influence on our management and policies and on the outcome of issues requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of our board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
we depend on contracts with government agencies  which if terminated or reduced  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
a large percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to government agencies 
such government agencies may be subject to budget cuts  budgetary constraints or a reduction or discontinuation of funding 
a significant reduction in funds available for government agencies to purchase professional services and related products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended september   million  or of our revenue  was derived from sales to government agencies 
we expect this revenue to decrease during fiscal due to the expiration of certain government contracts and the reduction in funding from the american recovery and relief act 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
although we provide products and services to many customers  a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a small number of customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   our top five customers accounted for of our revenue 
in addition  our customer contracts do not specify quantity nor delivery schedules 
instead  our customer orders are driven by purchase orders which makes our product revenue lumpy 
we cannot predict the future level of demand for our products and services that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for our products in the end user marketplace 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of any of our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would materially adversely affect revenues and our results of operations 
our relationship with these customers is subject to change 
our operating results could deteriorate if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to excessive reserves for obsolete products 
our products require incorporation of a wide range of materials which we typically buy in bulk prior to receiving customer orders for the full amount 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in inventory 
this approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products we hold in inventory and may compound the difficulties posed by other factors that affect our inventory levels which we have experienced  including the following the need to maintain significant inventory of materials that are in limited supply  the unpredictable demand for products  and customer requests for quick delivery schedules 
the accumulation of excess or obsolete inventory may result in increased inventory reserves  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we may need additional capital 
in order to conduct operations and remain competitive  we must make investments in research and development to fund new product initiatives  continue to upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities  and actively seek out potential acquisition candidates 
although we believe that internal cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and normal operating requirements for at least the next fiscal year  we cannot assure you that cash generated from operations will be sufficient and  even if sufficient  we may not be able to fund our planned research and development  capital investment programs  and potential acquisitions without seeking additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital depends on a variety of factors  some of which may not be within our control  including investor perceptions of our management  our business  and the industries in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that financial resources will be available promptly  on favorable terms or at all 
the turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or cease operations has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
if we raise additional capital through borrowings  we may become subject to restrictive covenants and high interest rates  which would increase the total cost of conducting operations 
if we raise money through the issuance of equity securities  your stock ownership will be diluted 
in addition  our stock price has been subject to volatility as a result of the instability in the overall financial markets and other factors 
as a result  a decline in the price of our common stock may adversely impact our ability to fund our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us following a decline in our stock price may result in a significant dilution of your stock ownership 
any inability to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or cost effective basis could adversely affect our short term liquidity and our ability to make investments in research and development to fund new product initiatives  continue to upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities  and actively seek out potential acquisition candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
an interruption in the supply of diagnostic and therapeutic products that we purchase from third parties could cause a decline in our revenue 
we purchase raw materials  components  services and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products  and the loss of  or disruption to  any supplier could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products 
we may experience an interruption of supply if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our time  quantity and quality requirements 
there are relatively few alternative suppliers for some of our raw materials and components 
any or all of these suppliers could discontinue manufacturing or supplying these products and components  experience interruptions in their operations or raise their prices 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all 
any transition to alternative suppliers may result in production delays and increased costs  limit our ability to deliver products to our customers or make our products unprofitable 
furthermore  if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply  we would have to modify our products to use substitute components  which may cause delays in shipments  increased design and manufacturing costs  increased prices for our products and lost revenue 
in addition  we compete with large companies as well as smaller  independent plasma collection centers and brokers of plasma products for plasma source material and processing 
we may be unable to realize our growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or if we cannot integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our business 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to grow our business through acquisitions of technologies or companies 
we may not identify or complete complementary acquisitions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis  or at all 
in addition  we compete with other companies  including large  well funded competitors  to acquire suitable targets  and may be unable to acquire certain targets that we seek 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute this component of our growth strategy  which may harm our business and hinder our future growth 
to achieve desired growth rates as we become larger  we may seek larger and or public companies as potential acquisition candidates 
the acquisition of a public company may involve additional risks  including the potential for lack of recourse against public shareholders for undisclosed material liabilities of the acquired business 
in addition  if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consisted of cash  a substantial portion of our available cash resources could be used 
furthermore  for any such acquisition  we will incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses  including expenses associated with a change of control 
if we pursue an acquisition that is not completed for any reason  we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  including anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses and our stock price may decline to the extent that it reflects a market assumption that the acquisition would be completed 
although we would expect to realize strategic  operational and financial benefits from any acquisition that we do complete  we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved 
working through integration issues is complex  time consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business 
there are significant challenges to integrating any acquired operations into our business  including successfully managing and assimilating the operations  facilities and technology of the acquired businesses  maintaining and increasing the customer base for the acquired products  demonstrating to customers and suppliers that the acquisitions will not result in adverse changes in service standards or business focus  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale  integrating cultures and management structures and accurately forecasting employee benefit costs  consolidating our management information  inventory  accounting and other systems  our ability to assess accurately the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  increased pressure on our staff and on our operating systems  and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business 
our failure to successfully integrate and operate any acquired businesses  and to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions  could adversely impact our operating performance and financial results 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees  including certain sales  consulting and technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate the qualified personnel that will be essential to our current plans and future development 
the competition for such personnel is substantial and we cannot assure you that we will successfully retain our key employees or attract and retain any required additional personnel 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the past  employees have resigned from our company and joined competitors or formed competing companies 
the loss of such personnel and the resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor have had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
lack of early success with our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers can shut us out of future business with those customers 
many of the products we sell to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are incorporated into the customers drug manufacturing processes 
in some cases  once a customer chooses a particular product for use in a diagnostic and therapeutic testing process or drug manufacturing process  it is less likely that the customer will later switch to a competing alternative 
in many cases  the regulatory license for the product will specify the separation and cell culture supplement products qualified for use in the process 
obtaining the regulatory approvals needed for a change in the manufacturing process is time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
accordingly  if we fail to convince a diagnostic or therapeutic customer to choose our products early in its manufacturing design phase  we may permanently lose the opportunity to participate in the customer s production of such product 
because we face vigorous competition in this market from companies with substantial financial and technical resources  we run the risk that our competitors will win significant early business with a customer making it difficult for us to recover that opportunity 
our profits will likely decline if we are unable to pass price increases on to customers or obtain necessary raw materials at their current prices 
some of our customer contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products that we make  regardless of the costs we incur 
if we experience significant increases in the expense of producing products due to increased cost of materials  components  labor  capital equipment or other factors and are unable to pass through such increases to our customers  our profitability will likely decline 
the cost of producing our products and services is also sensitive to the price of energy 
the selling prices of our products and services have not always increased in response to raw material  energy or other cost increases and we are unable to determine to what extent  if any  we will be able to pass future cost increases through to our customers 
our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new products may negatively impact our business 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances 
if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design  develop  manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner  our operating results will be adversely affected 
while we expect to continue to invest in research and development for all of our market segments  we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 
we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 
international sales accounted for of our revenue during the year ended september  we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
risks associated with these sales include changes in legal and regulatory requirements  export controls  united states and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products  changes in tax laws and tariffs  and political and economic instability 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we sell our products in certain international markets mainly through independent distributors 
if a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals  it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor 
if a change in our distributors becomes necessary  we may experience increased costs  as well as a substantial disruption in operations and a resulting loss of revenue 
if we fail to maintain adequate quality standards for our products and services  our business may be adversely affected and our reputation harmed 
our customers are subject to rigorous quality standards in order to maintain their products and the manufacturing processes and testing methods that generate them 
a failure to sustain the specified quality requirements  including the processing and testing functions performed by our products  could result in the loss of the applicable regulatory license 
delays or quality lapses in our customers production lines could result in substantial economic losses to them and to us 
for example  large production lots of plasma are expensive and a failure to properly categorize the disease state of plasma could result in the contamination of the entire lot  requiring its destruction and replacement at our cost 
we also perform services that may be considered an extension of our customers manufacturing and quality assurance processes  which also require the maintenance of prescribed levels of quality 
although we believe that our continued focus on quality throughout the company adequately addresses these risks  there can be no assurance that we will not experience occasional or systemic quality lapses in our manufacturing and service operations 
if we experience significant or prolonged quality problems  our business and reputation may be harmed  which may result in the loss of customers  our inability to participate in future customer product opportunities and reduced revenue and earnings 
we rely heavily on air cargo carriers and other third party package delivery services  and a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to import or export materials  increase our costs and lower our profitability 
we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies 
in addition  we transport materials among our facilities and import raw materials from worldwide sources 
consequently  we rely heavily on air cargo carriers and third party package delivery providers 
if any of our key third party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption such that any of our products  components or raw materials cannot be delivered in a timely fashion or such that we incur additional shipping costs that we could not pass on to our customers  our costs may increase and our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected 
in particular  our products are particularly sensitive to temperature and delays in shipping could damage the products 
in addition  if our third party package delivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments to our delivery network  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  and if our manufacturing capabilities are insufficient to produce an adequate supply of products at appropriate quality levels  our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed 
we currently have limited resources and facilities for the commercial manufacturing of sufficient quantities of product to meet expected demand 
we have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality  yields and throughput 
although we believe we currently have sufficient capacity in manufacturing to enable us to supply adequate amounts of product to support our commercialization efforts  there can be no assurance that supply will not be constrained going forward 
if we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of our products  maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth  or if we underestimate growth  we may not have the capability to satisfy market demand and our business will suffer 
the cost of compliance or failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of may adversely affect our business 
as a non accelerated filer  we are not subject to the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  requiring an attestation report from our registered independent public accounting firm regarding management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we cease to qualify as a non accelerated filer  we would become subject to this requirement  which may cause us to incur substantial additional costs and may adversely affect our financial results 
the failure of our registered independent public accounting firm to concur with management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact our business  our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock  prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as a public company and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business  revenues and results of operations 
the technology and designs underlying our products are not generally protected by patent rights 
our future success is dependent primarily on non patented trade secrets and on the innovative skills  technological expertise and management abilities of our employees 
our intellectual property rights may not preclude or inhibit competitors from producing products that have identical performance as our products 
in addition  if we attempt to recover damages arising from misappropriation of any intellectual property that we protect as a trade secret  we cannot guarantee that trade secret protection will be available 
any intellectual property litigation  even if successful  could be expensive and time consuming and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a manufacturer and marketer of various diagnostic and therapeutic products  we may face adverse publicity and potential claims regarding the performance  quality or safety of our products 
any product liability claims  such as claims challenging performance  quality or safety of our products may result in substantial damages and expenses as well as a decline in sales for our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
this could be true even if the claims themselves are proven not to be true or are settled for immaterial amounts 
our product liability insurance may be inadequate to cover any product liability claims we may face 
foreign restrictions on importation and exportation of blood derivatives could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
concern over blood safety has led to movements in a number of european and other countries to restrict the importation and exportation of blood and blood derivatives  including antibodies collected outside the countries borders or  in the case of certain european countries  outside europe 
to date  these efforts have not led to any meaningful restriction on the importation or exportation of blood or blood derivates and have not adversely affected our business 
such restrictions  however  continue to be debated  and there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed in the future 
if imposed  such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 
a disaster at our facilities could substantially impact our business 
a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could  among other things  delay the shipment of our products  affect our ability to receive and fulfill orders and hinder our research and development efforts 
for example  our two facilities in maryland store approximately million biological samples for our government and commercial customers  and such samples are irreplaceable 
additionally  our milford facility is our primary manufacturing plant 
an earthquake  fire  other disaster or continuous power outage at any of these locations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage does not cover terrorism or all natural disasters  in particular  floods  and may be inadequate to compensate us for losses we incur as a result of a natural disaster or other problem 
risks related to our industry our industry faces reduced demand as a result of the economic downturn 
our business is exposed to the risk that adverse economic conditions will reduce or defer the demand for research and development that utilize our products 
the demand for our products may fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  including the business and financial condition of our customers and on economic and financial conditions  particularly as they affect the key sectors in which our customers operate 
economic downturns or unfavorable changes in the financial and credit markets could have an adverse effect on the operations  budgets and overall financial condition of our customers 
as a result  our customers may reduce their overall spending on research and development  purchase fewer of our products by reducing the amount they use or using their existing inventory  lengthen sales cycles  or delay  defer or cancel purchases of our products 
furthermore  our customers may be less able to timely finance or pay for the products which they have purchased 
we cannot predict the impact  timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  either generally or in our industry  or of any disruptions in the financial and credit markets 
if the challenges in the financial and credit markets or the downturn in the economy or the markets in which we operate persist or worsen from present levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry  enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do  making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
moreover  competitive conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to implement price increases to fully recover any higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
competition for customers depends primarily on the ability to provide products or services of the quality and in the quantity required by customers 
if we succeed in bringing one or more products to market  we will compete with many other companies that may have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
our failure to provide products of the quality and quantity demanded by our customers and successfully market new products could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our disease state products are derived from donors with rare characteristics  resulting in increased competition for such donors 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our donor base  this could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to significant regulation by the government and other regulatory authorities 
our business is heavily regulated in the united states and internationally 
in addition to fda regulations regarding  among other matters  the testing  manufacturing  storage  labeling  export  and marketing of blood products and ivd products  various other federal  state  local and foreign regulations also apply and can be  in some cases  more restrictive 
if we fail to comply with fda or other regulatory requirements  we could be subjected to civil and criminal penalties  or even required to suspend or cease operations 
any such actions could severely curtail our sales to biologics companies 
failure of our plasma suppliers or customers to comply with fda requirements could also adversely affect us 
in addition  more restrictive laws  regulations or interpretations could be adopted  which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we also invest significant resources in developing quality assurance programs  such as iso certification 
we devote substantial resources to complying with laws and regulations  however  the possibility cannot be eliminated that interpretations of existing laws and regulations will result in findings that we have not complied with significant existing laws or regulations 
such a finding could materially harm our business 
moreover  healthcare reform is continually under consideration by regulators  and we do not know how laws and regulations will change in the future 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal occupational safety and health administration act  may result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure  and have a material adverse effect upon the our business 
we are subject to licensing and regulation under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including laws and regulations relating to the handling  transportation and disposal of medical specimens and infectious and hazardous waste  as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees 
all of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens  and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens 
in addition  the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers  including clinical laboratories  whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens  such as hiv and hbv 
these requirements  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to  and transmission of  blood borne pathogens 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all applicable standards or that violations will not occur 
failure to comply with federal  state and local laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  more restrictive laws  rules and regulations or enforcement policies could be adopted in the future which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business or prospects 
changes in demand for plasma derived products and the availability of donated plasma could affect profitability 
a majority of our business depends on the availability of donated plasma 
only a small percentage of the population donates plasma and regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply have decreased the pool of potential donors 
if the level of donor participation declines  we may not be able to obtain adequate supply at a reasonable cost to maintain profitability in plasma derived products 
we are subject to governmental reforms and the adequacy of reimbursement 
our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services  legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information  or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 
additional regulation and continued fiscal pressure may adversely affect our business 
risks related to our stock our stock price could be volatile 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may be more volatile in the future 
factors such as the announcements of government regulation  new products or services introduced by us or by our competitors  healthcare legislation  trends in health insurance  litigation  fluctuations in operating results and market conditions for healthcare stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the generally low volume of trading in our common stock makes it more vulnerable to rapid changes in price in response to market conditions 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have anti takeover effects 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that might be considered in the best interests of our shareholders 
these provisions  among other things require shareholders to provide advance notice of any nomination for director or any other business to be transacted at any meeting of shareholders  eliminate cumulative voting rights  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock having such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors  without any vote or further action by our shareholders  and eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent 
our shareholders ability to sell shares of our stock may be limited 
based on public reports filed as of september  by four of our shareholders  ltova  ashford capital  black horse capital and t 
rowe price  these shareholders collectively beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  we have a very limited number of shares in our public float  and as a result  there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock and the ability to buy and sell our shares could be impaired 
if any or all of ltova  ashford capital  black horse capital or t 
rowe price were to liquidate their shares  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our stock could be delisted if our stock price falls below 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq capital market requirements  our stock could be delisted by the nasdaq capital market 
for example  under nasdaq rules  our stock price must remain at or above per share price for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
delisting would adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business 
such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
we may issue preferred stock in the future 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors may  without further action by our shareholders  issue preferred stock in one or more series with rights senior to those of our common stock 
these rights may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation and conversion and redemption rights 
although we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock or to create any new series of preferred stock  the issuance of preferred stock could affect the rights  or even reduce the value  of our common stock 
lack of dividend payments 
we intend to retain any future earnings for use in our business and therefore do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the declaration and payment of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our earnings  financial condition  capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
additional risk factors 
in addition to the foregoing risk factors  our business  financial condition  and operating results could be seriously harmed by additional factors  including but not limited to the following our ability to maintain favorable agreements and relationships with major customers and suppliers  our ability to maintain and expand our customer base  increased competition for donors  which may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified donors  our ability to meet future customer demand for plasma products  and changes in industry trends  customer specifications and demand  market demand in general and potential foreign restrictions of the importation of our products

our customers include ivd manufacturers  hospital based  independent and public health labs  blood banks  government and regulatory agencies  and organizations involved in the discovery  development and commercial production of human and animal therapeutics and vaccines  including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  veterinary companies and academic and government research organizations 
in the years ended september   and  nih accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  and roche molecular systems accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates on at least a quarterly basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates and actual results could differ from these estimates

september  september  percent change diagnostic biopharmaceutical products bioservices total revenue revenue for the year ended september  increased by  or million  to million from million for the year ended september  diagnostic biopharmaceutical products revenue during the same period increased by million  a increase 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products revenue grew due to increased sales of therapeutic grade human serum albumin products as well as bioprocessing products but was partially offset by decreased sales of controls due to changes in the blood testing market 
during the year ended september   revenue for our bioservices segment increased by million  a increase  to million from million for the year ended september  the bioservices segment benefited from increased government funding of scientific research which resulted in additional services provided directly to the government as well as services provided to commercial customers who received government funding 
we expect revenue for our bioservices segment to decrease during fiscal due to the expiration of certain government contracts and the reduction in funding from the american recovery and relief act 
gross profit gross profit margin increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  our diagnostic biopharmaceutical products gross profit margin increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase is due to lower raw material costs and a reduction in manufacturing expenses due to the consolidation of our manufacturing facility 
our bioservices gross profit margin was for both the years ended september  and research and development expense research and development expense totaled million  or of revenue  for the year ended september  as compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended september  our customers have increased their product development requests  resulting in lower research and development expense as our scientists have been working on these billable customer projects and the associated cost is presented as cost of revenue 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal and the full year of fiscal  we controlled spending by focusing on priority projects 
as a result of the reduced spending  fiscal has a full year of savings as compared to a partial year of savings during fiscal we expect to increase research and development during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended september   from million  or of revenue for the year ended september  during the year ended september   we have focused on improving our processes and have decreased discretionary spending from the year ended september  during the year ended september   we collected previously written off receivables  resulting in recoveries to bad debt and negotiated lower pricing for various services 
these savings were partially offset by million for professional services related to exploring potential transactions 
impairment of assets we performed our annual impairment test as of march  and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
due to the expected decrease in bioservices revenue for fiscal  we retested goodwill for impairment as of september  and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
due to the economic downturn  the turmoil in the financial markets and the associated decline in our stock price and market capitalization  we tested goodwill for impairment during the first half of the year ended september  at that time  we revised our future cash flow projections as revenue during that period was lower than expected due to the economic downturn 
as a result  during the year ended september   we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill in the amount of million  all of which related to our diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
this represented the entire balance of goodwill related to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
the remaining goodwill of million on our balance sheets relates to the bioservices segment 
there has been no impairment charge associated with the bioservices segment as it is service driven and has fewer assigned assets which have a lower carrying amount as compared to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment which requires more assets to manufacture and sell products 
we will continue to test goodwill for impairment as part of our annual impairment testing or as events occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
loss related to assets held for sale on october   we signed a lease agreement which enabled us to consolidate all of our massachusetts operations into our milford facility during the year ended september  as a result  we began marketing our west bridgewater facility and land for sale 
due to a softening in the real estate market  we recorded a loss of million during the year ended september  to write down the assets to their fair value less costs to sell 
we sold these assets for million million net of selling expenses during the year ended september  operating income loss operating income loss resulted from the factors above and included stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization 
operating income was million for the year ended september   which included stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaling million and million  respectively  as compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended september   which included an impairment of goodwill  loss related to assets held for sale  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaling million  million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense and other income interest expense was million during the year ended september  as compared to million during the year ended september  during the year ended september   interest expense included million for the write off of unamortized deferred financing expenses and a termination fee related to our revolving credit facility which we terminated in october during the year ended september   interest expense primarily related to drawdowns on our revolving credit facility which we terminated during the year ended september  and our mortgage  which we repaid in january other income was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
other income related primarily to the collection of royalty payments from the sale of certain assets of our genomics collaborative division  which occurred in income tax expense during the year ended september   we recorded a state tax provision of million offset by a federal tax benefit of million 
the state tax provision related to a reserve for a state tax receivable which is currently under audit 
the federal tax benefit is due to federal tax law changes which allowed us to amend a prior return and utilize our net operating loss carry forwards to recover alternative minimum tax payments 
we recorded a nominal tax provision during the year ended september  as of september  and  we had a deferred tax asset  net of liabilities of million and million  respectively  which were fully reserved on the balance sheet 
net income loss and earnings loss per share as a result of the above  net income was million for the year ended september  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended september  earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis was and  respectively  for the year ended september  compared to net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis of for the year ended september  comparison of years ended september  and september  revenue the following table provides our segment revenue in millions of dollars for the years ended september  and  respectively

september  september  percent change diagnostic biopharmaceutical products bioservices total revenue revenue for the year ended september  decreased by  or million  to million from million for the year ended september  diagnostic biopharmaceutical products revenue during the same period decreased by million  a decrease from the prior period 
diagnostic biopharmaceutical products revenue had million in sales from therapeutic grade human serum albumin products during the year ended september  as compared to million during the year ended september  this revenue has historically been variable and we are building a new customer base as a result of switching suppliers in december excluding therapeutic grade human serum albumin products  revenue from our core manufactured products increased million  or 
during the year ended september   revenue for our bioservices segment decreased by million  or  to million from million in the year ended september  we billed million during the year ended september  pursuant to a government contract which related to the settlement of indirect billing rates used in previous periods 
we had no such billings during the year ended september  the remaining decrease is due to fewer requests for services from our customers as a result of reduced research spending stemming from the economic downturn during fiscal gross profit gross profit margin increased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the increase in margin was mainly attributable to the increase in our diagnostic biopharmaceutical products margin to in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the product margin increased due to efficiencies related to consolidating our manufacturing operations and improved cost cutting measures and the increased focus on inventory control taken during the year ended september  this increase in products margin was offset by the bioservices margin decreasing to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  during the year ended september   our bioservices margin rates benefited from million billed pursuant to a government contract which related to the settlement of indirect billing rates used in previous periods 
research and development expense research and development expense totaled million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  and million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we focused on cost control resulting in reduced compensation and other project related expenses 
as a result  spending decreased as compared to the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in the year ended september   from million  or of revenue  in the year ended september  as part of our fiscal operating plan  we streamlined the organization to achieve operational efficiencies and reduce compensation expense 
we also reduced other spending compared to the prior year  including marketing  travel and office expenses 
in addition  stock compensation expense decreased million during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september impairment of assets due to the turmoil in the financial markets and the associated decline in our stock price and market capitalization  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million during the year ended september  related to our diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
during the first half of the year ended september   the financial markets and our stock price continued to decline and we revised our future cash flow projections as revenue was lower than expected due to the economic downturn 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill in the amount of million  all of which related to our diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
this represented the entire balance of goodwill related to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment 
the remaining goodwill of million on our balance sheets related to the bioservices segment 
there was no impairment charge associated with the bioservices segment as it is service driven and has fewer assigned assets which have a lower carrying amount as compared to the diagnostic biopharmaceutical products segment which requires more assets to manufacture and sell products 
loss related to assets held for sale on october   we signed a lease agreement which enabled us to consolidate all of our massachusetts operations into our milford facility during the year ended september  as a result  we began marketing our west bridgewater facility and land for sale 
due to a softening in the real estate market  we recorded a loss of million during the year ended september  to write down the assets to their fair value less costs to sell 
we sold these assets for million during the year ended september  reorganization items reorganization items include legal  accounting and other professional fees related to our bankruptcy proceedings  reorganization  litigation  relisting on nasdaq and efforts to become a current and timely filer with the sec 
these expenses totaled million during the year ended september  there were no reorganization items during the year ended september  operating loss operating loss resulted from the factors above and included impairment charges  stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization 
our operating loss was million for the year ended september   which included impairment charges to goodwill and our assets held for sale  stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization totaling million  million  million and million  respectively  as compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended september   which included an impairment charge to goodwill  stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization totaling million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense and other income interest expense totaled million in each of the years ended september  and during the year ended september   other income was million which primarily related to royalties from the sale of the genomics collaborative division in fiscal other income was million during the year ended september  which primarily related to interest received from the federal and state governments for tax refunds 
income tax expense benefit taxes were nominal during the year ended september  during the year ended september   we recognized a tax benefit of million as a result of amending our previously filed tax returns 
as of september  and  we had deferred tax assets  net of liabilities  of million and million  respectively  which were fully reserved on the balance sheet 
net loss and net loss per share as a result of the above  net loss was million in the year ended september  compared to a net loss of million in the year ended september  net loss per share on a basic and fully diluted basis was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated in millions

september  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of september   our cash balance was million  an increase of million from our cash balance as of september  as of september   we maintained substantially all of our cash at one financial institution in non interest bearing deposit accounts 
since interest rates are low  this strategy generates a higher savings to bank fees than the interest income that would have been earned in an interest bearing account 
we had a current ratio  current assets to current liabilities  of to as of september  compared to to as of september  total liabilities as of september  were million compared to million as of september  the total debt to equity ratio was to as of both september  and september we believe our current cash on hand combined with expected future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended september   an improvement of million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended september  during the year ended september   we had net income of million  which included non cash charges of approximately million  primarily related to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization and inventory write downs 
inventory  accrued expenses and accounts payable increased million  million and million  respectively 
inventory increased in order to meet expected upcoming demand 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to customer deposits and the deferral of revenue on our government contracts due to our indirect billing rate 
the indirect billing rate applied to government contract invoices is a preliminary rate subject to government audit  and is higher than our calculated indirect billing rate for fiscal the government is currently in the process of reviewing our indirect billing rate calculation for fiscal we have reserved the revenue in excess of our calculated indirect billing rate for fiscal our accounts payable increased at september  due to the purchase of equipment as requested under our billable government contracts 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was million 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had a net loss of million  which included non cash charges of approximately million  primarily related to goodwill impairment  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
inventory decreased by million while receivables increased by million 
we had decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively 
inventory decreased as we reduced production and sold the surplus inventory that we had intentionally built up at the end of fiscal in preparation for the move of our manufacturing operations from west bridgewater  massachusetts to milford  massachusetts 
our trade receivables increased million due to stronger sales at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal we received a tax refund from the federal government which decreased our taxes receivable by million 
accounts payable declined as we decreased spending during the year ended september  accrued expenses decreased due to the payment of accruals for the renovations at our maryland facilities which are complete

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased an additional million of equipment that will be paid for in early fiscal during the year ended september   we received million from our landlord for renovations at our gaithersburg  maryland facility 
in addition  we spent million for equipment as well as for renovations at our frederick  maryland facility 
during the years ended september  and  we received million and million  respectively  in royalty payments related to the sale of certain assets of our genomics collaborative division which occurred in financing cash flows cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended september  compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended september  during the year ended september   we made debt payments of million  primarily for the mortgage note which we repaid in full when we sold our west bridgewater facility 
during the first half of the year ended september   we utilized our revolving credit facility and received proceeds of million  all of which was repaid during the year ended september  we also made payments for the mortgage note and various capital leases totaling million during the year ended september  off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended september   we were not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
debt as of september   we had debt of less than million comprised of various capital leases 
at september   we had a million revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at that time  the effective interest rate on the facility was per annum  and there was no outstanding balance 
we terminated the credit facility in october we paid a million termination fee  which was charged to interest expense during the year ended september  we also had million of unamortized deferred financing expenses related to the credit facility  which was also charged to interest expense during the year ended september  at september   we also had a mortgage note on our west bridgewater facility and land  which was then due in february the principal amount outstanding under the note was million as of september  at that time  the effective interest rate on the note was per annum 
we sold the west bridgewater facility and land in december and repaid the mortgage note in full at that time 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have determined that for the periods covered in our annual report the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements 
to prepare the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in particular  we provide estimates regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable  the net realizable value of our inventory  the recoverability of long lived assets  as well as our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
future financial results could differ materially from current financial results 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the company meets all of the criteria specified in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
these criteria include evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  prices are fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
signed customer purchase orders or sales agreements evidence our sales arrangements 
these purchase orders and sales agreements specify both selling prices and quantities  which are the basis for recording sales revenue 
trade terms for the majority of our sales contracts indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers when we ship products from our facilities  which is when revenue is recognized 
revenue is deferred until the appropriate time in situations where trade terms indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers at a later stage in the shipment process 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided as long as all other criteria of sab are met 
returns 
we will accept the return of goods  if prior to returning the goods  the purchaser contacts us and requests a return authorization and we approve this authorization based upon the customer clearly stating the reason for the return 
we maintain an allowance for sales returns and record a decrease to revenue when we have specific knowledge of a customer complaint 
the allowance for sales returns was nominal as of both september  and inventory valuation 
inventory consists primarily of human blood plasma and products derived from human blood plasma 
inventory is carried at specifically identified cost and assessed periodically to ensure it is valued at the lower of cost or market 
our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to excessive reserves for obsolete products 
our products require incorporation of a wide range of materials which we typically buy in bulk prior to receiving customer orders for the full amount 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in inventory 
this approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products we hold in inventory 
a provision has been made to reduce excess and not readily marketable inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
we provide a reserve based upon factors related to age  historical scrap rates  usability and fair market value 
our recorded inventory reserve was million and million as of september  and  respectively 
should it be determined that the reserve is insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on our gross profit margin 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held for use is based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows from the related operations  and when circumstances dictate  we adjust the asset to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge  which would result in decreased results of operations  and decrease the carrying value of these assets 
property and equipment are carried at historical cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of significant improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets are as follows

furniture and equipment years computer equipment and software years leasehold improvements shorter of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease contingencies and litigation reserves 
we are involved from time to time in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
these claims may be brought by  among others  the government  clients  customers  employees and other third parties 
management considers the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims 
in determining contingency and litigation reserves  management considers  among other issues interpretation of contractual rights and obligations  the status of government regulatory initiatives  interpretations and investigations  the status of settlement negotiations  prior experience with similar types of claims  whether there is available insurance  and advice of counsel 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
goodwill is evaluated annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we have assigned goodwill to discrete reporting units and determine impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  management is required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided when management cannot determine whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the statement of operations will result 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded in connection with the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of september  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision  lowering income and negatively impacting our financial position 
should realization of these deferred assets previously reserved occur  the provision for income tax would decrease  raising income and positively impacting our financial position 
in addition  any interest and penalties assessed by the taxing authorities are recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation 
we recognize share based payments to employees and directors as compensation expense using a fair value based method in the results of operations 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended september   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
we recognize the associated compensation expense on a graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
management believes this graded vesting methodology is a truer reflection of the expenses incurred for the options granted than the alternative straight line method 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are based on the historical fluctuation in the stock price since inception 
the average expected term was calculated under the guidance of sab no 
and  simplified method for estimating the expected term as we have limited exercise data since we reorganized in may expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions will be updated at least on an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board the fasb provided guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities which applies whenever other guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
the guidance clarifies that for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just the company s mark to market value 
the guidance also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  such as the reporting entity s own data 
under the guidance  fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of the guidance for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we adopted this guidance on october  for assets and liabilities not subject to the deferral and on october  for all other assets and liabilities 
the guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb revised its guidance for business combinations 
under the revised guidance  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the guidance will change the accounting treatment for certain items as follows acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
the revised guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the revised guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted this guidance on october  the guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued guidance which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
the guidance clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this guidance requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
the guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we adopted this guidance on october  the guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
the guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  accordingly  we will adopt this guidance on october  the guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands
