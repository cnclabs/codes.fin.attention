interest rate risk with respect to accumulation and investment oriented products  we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread  or margin  between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders 
if we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers  our spreads are reduced 
provided investment yields and default experience continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long term perspective  we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material 
the combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months  asset liability management strategies  flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates

interest rate risk on fixed insurance business falling rates the spreads on our fixed annuity  term life  whole life  interest sensitive whole life  universal life ul  fixed portion of defined contribution business and fixed portion of variable universal life vul insurance policies are at risk if interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time  which has generally been the case in recent years 
should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years  the average earned rate of return on our annuity and ul investment portfolios will continue to decline 
declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and ul policies 
minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and ul policies generally range from to

the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates 
we devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
we seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
interest rate risk on fixed insurance business rising rates for both annuities and ul  a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders 
if we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  our spreads will narrow 
we devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions 
with these instruments in place  the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances 
debt we manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise 
see note for additional information on our debt 
derivatives we have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates 
the derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing 
such derivatives include interest rate swaps  interest rate futures  interest rate caps and treasury locks 
see note for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
in addition to continuing existing programs  we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns  particularly in the management of investment spread businesses 
we have established policies  guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations 
annually  our board of directors reviews our derivatives policy 
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency denominated investments we invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to united states dollar denominated usd securities 
we use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies 
the currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds

due to the use of our reversion to the mean rtm process and our hedging strategies  we expect that  in general  short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs dac  value of business acquired voba  deferred sales inducements dsi and deferred front end sales loads dfel 
however  there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets 
refer to our item md a critical accounting policies and estimates dac  voba  dsi and dfel for further discussion on the impact of equity markets on our rtm 
fee revenues the fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
these fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions 
such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers 
assets while we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments  the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed income investments 
these investments  however  add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments

such derivatives include over the counter equity call options  equity collars  variance swaps  total return swaps  put options  equity futures and call options 
see note for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations 
impact of equity market sensitivity due to the use of our rtm process and our hedging strategies as described in md a critical accounting policies and estimates  we expect that  in general  short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for dac  voba  dsi and dfel  as we do not unlock our long term equity market assumptions based upon short term fluctuations in the equity markets 
however  there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets 
the following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations in millions  from the change in asset based fees and related expenses  if the level of the s p index s p were to drop to immediately after december   and remaining at that level through the next twelve months or dropped to immediately after december   and remain at that level through the next twelve months  excluding any impact related to sales  prospective unlocking  persistency  hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change s p s p at at segment retirement solutions annuities retirement solutions defined contribution if the level of the s p dropped to immediately after december   and remained at that level in subsequent periods  we project that we would have an rtm prospective unlocking of approximately million to million  after tax  for retirement solutions late in if the level of the s p dropped to immediately after december   and remained at that level in subsequent periods  we project that we would have an rtm prospective unlocking of approximately million to million  after tax  for retirement solutions late in the baseline for these impacts assumes annual equity market growth beginning on january  the baseline is then compared to scenarios of s p at the and levels  which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at annually thereafter 
the difference between the baseline and s p at the and level scenarios is presented in the table 
the impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months 
the effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values 
the difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods 
additionally  the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets 
this discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative 
actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts  switching among investment alternatives available within variable products  changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency 
for purposes of this guidance  the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index 
default risk our portfolio of invested assets was billion and billion as of december   and december   respectively 
of this total  billion and billion consisted of corporate bonds and billion and billion consist of commercial mortgages as of december   and december   respectively 
we manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality 
additional diversification limits  such as limits per industry  are also applied 
we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
we depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
we generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
credit related derivatives we use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders 
for additional information see note credit risk by using derivative instruments  we are exposed to credit risk our counterparty fails to make payment and market risk the value of the instrument falls 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and  therefore  creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk  but have been affected by market risk 
we minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us  by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty  and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits 
we also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association isda master agreement 
we do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us 
we have derivative positions with counterparties 
assuming zero recovery value  our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty  less collateral  that would be lost if the counterparty were to default 
as of december   and december   our counterparty risk exposure  net of collateral  was million and million  respectively 
we have exposure to counterparties  with a maximum exposure of million  net of collateral  to a single counterparty 
the credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long standing  superior performance records 
for the majority of lnc counterparties  there is a termination event should long term debt ratings of lnc rating drop below bbb baa additionally  we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an isda master agreement 
our fair value of counterparty exposure in millions was as follows as of december  rating aaa aa a bbb bb and below investment grade total
