we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report on form k 
executive summary the year ended december  was extremely tumultuous for the us economy and  more specifically  for the financial services industry 
real estate values continued to deteriorate  providing a catalyst for declining valuations across nearly all asset classes  including loans  foreclosed real estate and securities 
property value declines  which began in late  continued to decline throughout while banctrust did not have material exposure to many of the issues that plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles  collateralized debt obligations  the company s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily within its commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and other real estate expenses 
we reported a net loss available to common shareholders in of million  or per diluted common share  compared with net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share  for the results included a million per diluted share non cash write off of goodwill 
the earnings were further reduced by preferred stock dividends of million  or per common share  in and  or per common share  in net interest income declined to million in compared with million in the decline in interest income was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the net interest margin to in compared with in banctrust s increase in non performing assets over the past year also contributed to the decline in net interest income and net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses was million compared with million in the period 
the increase in the provision since last year was due primarily to increased charge offs and a higher level of criticized and non performing loans in our coastal markets 
net charge offs were million in compared with million in non performing assets totaled million at december   compared with million at december  we significantly increased our provision for loan losses in response to increasing criticized and non performing assets  primarily in our coastal markets 
we believe the additional provisions were warranted in light of economic conditions and continued downward pressure on real estate collateral values 
although we believe our allowance is adequate at year end to cover projected loan losses  future changes in housing values  financial condition of borrowers  interest rates and economic conditions could impact the provision for credit losses for these loans in future periods 
we remain focused on credit quality to protect our future earnings and capital base 
non interest income was flat at million for and the results included a million increase in security gains offset partially by decreased trust department revenue and service charges 
the results included a million gain on the sale of an interest rate floor contract 
non interest expense  excluding the million charge for goodwill impairment  increased to million in compared with to million in the increase was due to a million increase in loss write down on other real estate owned  or oreo  a million increase in fdic insurance costs and special assessment  and a million increase in carrying costs related to oreo compared with our market areas continue to be impacted by bank merger activity and the unprecedented market events within the financial services industry 
we remain focused on providing our customers with personal attention and services to support their financial requirements 
we believe we are in an excellent position to take advantage of the changes in the banking markets by leveraging our strong capital base to fund future loan growth as the economy recovers 
as a bank holding company  our results of operations are almost entirely dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary bank 
the following table contains selected data related to our subsidiary bank number of locations market area counties total assets at december  in thousands autauga  baldwin  barbour  bibb  butler  dallas  elmore  escambia  jefferson  lee  marengo  mobile  monroe  montgomery  shelby  in alabama and bay  okaloosa  walton in florida we offer a broad range of financial services to our customers  including retail banking  trust  insurance and securities services and products  through the bank  our trust department and a financial services subsidiary of the bank 
like most community banks  we derive the majority of our revenue from the interest we earn on our loans and investments  and our greatest reoccurring expense is the interest we pay on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our net interest income  which is the difference between the revenues we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expenses we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
another key measure of our success is our net interest margin  or the difference between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses  in the following discussion 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers  including service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage fees  trust fees and fees for investment services 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this non interest income  as well as of our non interest expense 
we measure and monitor the following factors as key indicators of our financial performance net income earnings per share loan and deposit growth credit quality effect of economic trends in  many economists believed the economy was beginning to show signs of strengthening  and the federal reserve  after several years of low interest rates  increased the federal funds interest rate by basis points and by an additional basis points during in mid the federal reserve stopped increasing rates  and problems in the sub prime real estate market began to appear later in the year 
in problems in the sub prime real estate market began to intensify  and problems in the debt markets in general began to appear 
in august of  the federal reserve began reducing interest rates in an effort to combat the economic effects of the debt problems 
the interest rate reductions accelerated throughout in  rates remained steady at a relatively low level 
along with the sub prime problems  th e national real estate market continued to experience a general reduction in sales and values of homes and commercial real estate 
while these problems have affected wide areas of the united states  they have been amplified in our coastal markets in florida and alabama by the continuing market disruption caused by major hurricanes in and our urban markets such as mobile  montgomery and birmingham have not been as severely affected  however deterioration has occurred in all of our markets 
an increase in unemployment has exacerbated these problems 
the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate loan portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy that could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral values  title defects  inaccurate appraisals and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for construction  whether the builders can sell the home to buyers and whether buyers can obtain permanent financing 
until mid  real estate values in our metropolitan montgomery and coastal alabama and flor ida markets increased  and employment trends in our market areas were favorable 
we experienced a slowdown in loan demand in our coastal markets in the fall of which has continued through the most likely reason for the slowdown initially was the effects of hurricanes in and along the gulf coast  especially hurricane katrina in august of the sub prime problem  resulting in a deep recession  combined with the collapse of the real estate market in some areas  has intensified the problems along the gulf coast 
we increased significantly the provision for loan losses in as a result of the deterioration in the real estate market  the higher level of criticized and non performing loans and the continuing uncertainty regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
the year was marked by severe recession 
financial and credit markets continued to decline sharply  building on issues that began in the sub prime mortgage market in the second half of and which led to significant declines in real estate and home values 
consumer confidence across all sectors of the economy has declined 
these conditions were accompanied by a further deterioration in the labor market and rising unemployment  all of which contributed to continued market volatility as economic fears and illiquidity persisted 
concerns regarding increased credit losses from the weakening economy negatively affected capital and earnings of most financial institutions 
financial institutions experienced significant declines in the value of collateral for real estate loans and heightened credit losses  resulting in recor d levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
in addition  certain financial institutions failed or merged with other institutions 
various agencies of the united states government proposed a number of initiatives to stabilize the global economy and financial markets  including the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa including the troubled asset relief program tarp  the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  the financial stability plan and american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
arra  among other things  amended the terms of the tarp and imposed certain additional conditions and requirements on participating institutions such as banctrust 
however  it also loosened the limitations on redemption by allowing affected institutions to repay tarp proceeds at any time  subject to approval of the participating institution s primary regulator 
treasury  the fdic and other governmental agencies continue to enact rules and regulations to implement the eesa  tarp  the financial stability plan  the arra and related economic recovery programs  many of which contain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to take certain actions or to engage in certain activities if the financial institution is a participant in the tarp capital purchase program or related programs 
we are unable to predict the actual impact of the eesa  the fdic programs or any other governmental program on the financial markets 
while there are signs that the recession is beginning to recede  unemployment remains high and strained economic conditions are expected to continue in as a result  financial institutions like banctrust continue to experience higher than historical rates of credit losses and higher levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
these factors negatively influenced  and likely will continue to negatively influence  earning asset yields at a time when the market for deposits is intensely competitive 
as a result  financial institutions experienced  and are expected to continue to experience  pressure on credit costs  loan yields  deposit and other borrowing costs  liquidity  and capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  included in this report on form k 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a description of what we deem to be our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with gaap and other regulatory guidance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
management has developed and uses a documented systematic methodology for determining and maintaining an allowance for loan losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks and probable loss 
management uses the loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans in the portfolio  management determines estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral  and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loan s observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans  management also determines probable losses for all other loans that are not individually evaluated 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan quality ratios and such other factors that  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
goodwill net assets of entities acquired in purchase transactions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
identified intangibles are amortized over the period benefited 
goodwill is not amortized  although it is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment 
the impairment test is performed in two steps 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step analysis must be undertaken 
the second step analysis compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carryin g amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
management engages external valuation specialists to assist in its goodwill assessments 
the company completed its annual test of goodwill for impairment as of september  which test indicated that none of the company s goodwill was impaired 
management updated its test for impairment of goodwill at december  due to the decline in the price of our common stock and net earnings in the fourth quarter of the results of this test indicated that none of the company s goodwill was impaired 
at march   due to the decline in the price of our common stock and the net loss in the first quarter of  management again tested for impairment of goodwill 
the results of this test indic ated that none of the company s goodwill was impaired 
at june  the company again tested its goodwill for impairment due to the further decline in the value of the company s stock and due to the net loss in the second quarter of the fair value of our enterprise at june  was determined using two methods 
the first was a market approach based on the actual market capitalization of the company  adjusted for a control premium 
the second was an income approach based on discounted cash flow models with estimated cash flows based on internal forecasts of net income 
both methods were used to estimate the fair value of the company 
these two methods provided a range of valuations that management used in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment 
at march  and june   management determined that the carrying amount of the company s sole report ing unit exceeded its fair value  and management performed a second step analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the results of this second step analysis at march  supported the carrying amount of our goodwill  and  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded at march  the results of this second step analysis at june  indicated that all of the company s goodwill was impaired  and  therefore  the company recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of to write off all of its goodwill 
the company s stock price at march  was per share 
at june   the company s stock price had declined percent to per share 
additionally  the average stock price for the quarter had declined percent from per share from the first quarter of to per share for the second quarter of the values determined using the discounted cash flow model decreased by approximately million from march  to june   primarily due to the increase in the projected loss for the year and the use of a higher discount rate 
we used a higher discount rate of percent at june  versus percent at march  for the june  testing to compensate for increased risk due to the higher levels on non performing loans  higher loan charge offs and the contin ued weakness in our florida market 
these decreases led to a lower estimated fair value of equity at june  compared to march  the company s methodology for its step testing in was consistent with tests performed in  subject only to minor refinements each quarter 
these refinements had no material impact on the analysis 
the company performed two step tests in  once at the end of the first quarter and again at the end of the second quarter 
the company used similar assumptions and methodologies in each of these tests 
this write off of goodwill had no effect on our cash flows  our regulatory capital  the operation of our business or our ability to service our customers 
at december   the company had no goodwill 
other real estate owned valuation other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value  as determined by management  less costs to dispose 
any excess of the recorded investment over fair value  less costs to dispose  is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure 
a provision is charged to earnings and the carrying value of other real estate owned is adjusted when  in the opinion of management  such losses have occurred 
the ability of the company to recover the carrying value of real estate is based upon future sales of the real estate 
the ability to effect such sales is subject to market conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the recognition of sales and sales gains or losses is dependent upon whether the nature and term of the sales  including possi ble future involvement of the company  if any  meet certain defined requirements 
if not met  sale and gain recognition would be deferred 
income taxes management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases 
in estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risk of various tax positions considering statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations  interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments 
judgments are also exercised in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets and any needed valuation allowances 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax credi ts  available tax carrybacks  tax planning strategies  and expected future taxable income in this assessment 
changes in the estimate of income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income  interpretations of tax laws  the complexities of multi state income tax reporting  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation or guidance as well as income tax accounting pronouncements 
financial condition acquisition in october of  the company completed the acquisition of the peoples banctrust company  inc peoples 
on the acquisition date the assets of peoples were approximately million 
the acquisition of peoples was accounted for under the purchase accounting method as required by united states generally accepted accounting principles 
under this method of accounting  the financial statements and tables shown in this section do not reflect results of operations or the financial condition of peoples prior to october  one result of this accounting method is that certain items shown in the following financial statements and tables are less useful in comparing  and to other years shown 
average assets and liabilities average assets in were billion  relatively unchanged from average loans in were billion compared to billion in average loans net of the loan loss reserve were billion in compared to billion in the decrease was a result of the weak economy s effect on loan demand and the transfer of some loans to oreo through the foreclosure process 
during we concentrated our efforts on improving loan quality rather than on growing loans and we expect this policy to continue at least through the first half of due to the soft economy 
compared to  average investment securities in increased million and average interest bearing deposits increased million  both of which increases were funded by the increase in average deposits and the decrease in average loans 
as liquidity concerns moderated somewhat in mid  we increased the size of the investment portfolio in order to increase our yield on earning assets 
average deposits in were billion compared to billion in short term and long term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  notes payable to our subsidiary statutory trusts issued in connection with trust preferred securities offerings and a note payable secured by the stock of our subsidiary bank 
in december  we issued an additional million of trust preferred securities 
part of the funds were used to pay off a bank loan  and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in october of  in order to complete the purchase of peoples  we obtained a term bank loan in the amount of million 
in december we issued million worth of preferred stock to the us treasury and used million of the pro ceeds to pay down the bank loan 
our average equity as a percent of average total assets in was percent  compared to percent in average equity in and included approximately million and million  respectively  recorded as intangible assets related to acquisitions accounted for as purchases

loan growth continued to be strong into mid as economic conditions in our markets were good 
after the hurricane season and hurricane katrina in september of that year  loan demand in our markets directly on the gulf of mexico slowed considerably 
we believe the psychological effects of the storms of and  as well as severe problems in the property insurance industry and overall economic decline  contributed to the slowdown in loan demand throughout our coastal markets that began in late the severe recession that followed the collapse of the sub prime market made the pro blem worse 
our average loan to deposit ratio was percent in  percent in and percent in our loan to deposit ratio at year end was percent compared to percent at year end and percent at year end our lending strategy concentrates on originating loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of our outstanding loans at december   million  or percent  mature within one year or otherwise reprice within one year 
net interest revenue and net interest margin decreased in and were affected  in part  by higher levels of non performing loans and oreo 
net interest revenue and the net interest margin are discussed more fully under results of operations 
we offer  through third party arrangements  certain mortgage loan products that we sell to these third parties shortly after origination and that are therefore not retained in our loan portfolio 
these products expand our mortgage loan product offerings and have the capacity to generate significant fee income  especially during periods of relatively low mortgage rates 
these fees have come from first and second home purchases as well as from home refinancing volume 
mortgage loan origination volume in several of our markets has declined due to the downturn in the national housing market 
refinancing and new sales volume in all of our markets has slowed 
the return to lower mortgage rates in the last half of has helped to offset some of the decrease in volume caused by the recession

economic conditions restrained loan demand throughout banktrust is seeking new credit relationships and renewing existing ones  but the overall demand level has been insufficient to overcome the effect of repayments and maturities  along with the effect of problem loan resolution 
this situation is expected to continue

approximately percent of the c and i portfolio is serviced in the southern alabama region  primarily in the mobile office 
approximately percent of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate  primarily commercial construction  land  land development  and non residential and commercial mortgages 
project financing is an important component of the commercial real estate loan portfolio  which was impacted by charge offs and foreclosures during management expects that the current economy will continue to limit this type of lending in the immediate future

securities gaap requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
securities are classified as held to maturity if management has the positive intent  and we have the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities are classified as available for sale if they are to be held for indefinite periods of time  such as securities management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of our securities were sta ted at estimated fair value since they were in the available for sale category 
at december   we held no trading securities or securities classified as held to maturity 
the company recorded an impairment charge related to potential credit loss of thousand in related to one investment security 
the company has credit support from subordinate tranches of this security  but the company has concluded that its unrealized loss position is other than temporary 
the amount related to credit loss was determined based on a discounted cash flow method that takes into account several factors including default rates  prepayment rates  delinquency rates  and foreclosure and loss severity of the underlying collateral 
changes in these factors in the future could result in an increase in the amount deemed to be credit related other than temporary impairment which would result in the company recognizing additional impairment charges to earnings for this security 
management will continue to closely monitor t his security 
the security has an estimated fair value of million and an unrealized loss of thousand at december  the company does not believe that any non credit other than temporary impairments exist related to these investment securities 
the company does not own  and has not owned  preferred or common stock issued by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
the company does not own any trust preferred securities 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities 
the average stated contractual maturities may differ from the average expected life because of amortized principal payments or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations

all of the growth in average deposits in occurred in savings deposits and time deposits 
in  interest bearing demand deposits decreased in part as customers moved into time deposits for higher rates 
average deposits increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of the peoples acquisition 
we define core deposits as total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more 
core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  represented percent and percent at year end and  respectively 
however  a significant amount of our certificates of deposit which are defined in the industry as non core  are held by long time banctrust customers 
these deposits are classified as non core because the amounts exceed  while our primary deposit taking emphasis focuses on attracting and retaining core deposits from customers who will also use our other products and services  we have from time to time found it necessary to use non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
this was the case in periods of very rapid loan growth such as we experienced during and we do not currently need to access additional non core funding sources such as brokered deposits  as internally generated funds are supplying our liquidity needs 
while we might consider increasing brokered deposits or federal home loan bank borrowings again during periods when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth  we are currently focused on minimizing our reliance on these sources of funds 
during  we replaced brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings as they matured  as we sought to maintain our liquidity during the current recession

relatively all of our short term borrowings in were related to a loan obtained to finance part of our purchase of peoples 
in  we obtained a million term loan which we used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the peoples banctrust company 
on december  we prepaid million of the loan 
the loan matures in october of and was carried as short term debt as of december  the interest rate on this loan is based on one month libor plus a spread 
the spread is based on our level of non performing assets and can fluctuate monthly 
the spread at december  was basis points  which is the maximum spread possible under the loan agreement 
this loan is secured by our stock in the bank and requires quarterly interest payments 
beginning as of march  and continuing through june   the company was in breach of one or more financial covenants in its loan agreement with silverton bank  na formerly the bankers bank  na  which loan agreement was assumed by federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver for silverton bank  na the current outstanding principal balance of the loan is million  and the stock of our subsidiary bank is pledged as collateral 
each quarter we have obtained a waiver of these covenant breaches from silverton or the fdic as receiver  as applicable 
on october  the fdic as receiver for silverton bank  na and the company signed an amendment to the loan agreement that modified the loan covenants in the following ways i by deleting the covenant regarding the required minimum ratio of non performing assets to the sum of total loans and other real estate owned and replacing it with a covenant that the company s non performing assets shall not exceed million at the end of any calendar quarter  ii by deleting the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant and replacing it with a covenant requiring the company to maintain a minimum allowance for loan and lease losses for its bank subsidiary of at least of its gross loans  and iii by modifying the covenant regarding classified assets to require that the company s assets which are classified as substandard and doubtful shall be less than million 
the amendment was effective with respect to the company s covenants commencing as of september   and the company is now in compliance with all of the modified loan covenants 
this loan was classified as long term debt in periods prior to our goal is to minimize our reliance on overnight funds as a funding source  and we have generally been successful in this for the last years 
we had average overnight investments of million during while average short term borrowings were million

standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the company generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
a financial standby letter of credit is a commitment by the company to guarantee a customer s repayment of an outstanding loan or financial obligation 
in a performance standby letter of credit  the company guarantees a customer s performance under a contractual non financial obligation for which it receives a fee 
the company has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
revenues are recognized over the life of the standby letter of credit 
the maximum potential a mount of future payments the company could be required to make under its standby letters of credit at december  was million  and that sum represents the company s maximum credit risk 
at december   the company had thousand of unearned fees associated with standby letter of credit agreements 
the company holds collateral to support standby letters of credit when deemed necessary

maximizing return means achieving or exceeding our profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
our asset liability management involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management that meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
management does not typically use derivative financial instruments as part of the asset liability management process 
our primary market risk is our exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing the effects of changes in market rates of interest on operating results and asset and liability fair values 
a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy is to manage and match the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
we use modeling techniques to simulate the effects various changes in market rates of interest would have on our interest income and on the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
important elements that affect the risk profile of our statement of condition in interest rate risk modeling include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of assets and liabilities 
using the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table  applying a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   we would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million for the year following the rate increase 
using a scenario simulating a hyp othetical basis point decrease  we would expect a net increase in net interest income of million for the year following the rate decrease 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events or of the actual effects such rate increases or decreases would have on our financial condition and operating results 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet its funding needs with its available sources of funds 
it represents our ability to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
in addition to our ability to meet liquidity demands through current assets and liabilities  we had available at december   federal funds lines of credit of million and availability on fhlb lines of credit of million 
our availability on our existing fhlb line of credit has been adversely impacted by new collatera l standards issued by the fhlb and by our higher level on non performing assets 
our asset liability committee  which is made up of certain members of management and the board of directors  monitors our liquidity position and formulates and implements  when appropriate  corrective measures in the event certain liquidity parameters are exceeded 
banctrust s liquidity  on an unconsolidated basis  is dependent on the holding company s ability to pay its commitments as they come due 
banctrust s most significant recurring commitments consist of interest payments on debt obligations  dividends on the preferred stock held by the us treasury and operating costs 
banctrust typically relies on dividends from the bank to fund these payments 
the bank is currently unable to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
in addition  we are unable to declare dividends on our preferred stock held by the us treasury without prior approval from the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
the bank requested and received permission to pay a dividend in the amount of million to banctrust in the first quarter of  and we have  to date  been able to obtain federal reserve approval for the declaration of dividends on our preferred stock held by the us treasury 
management plans to request approval for additional bank and holding company dividends as needed during the year 
as long as the bank remains classified under regulatory guidelines as well capitalized  we expect to be able to obtain approval for the bank to make dividend payments sufficient to enable banctrust to meet its commitments 
we also expect to be able to obtain federal reserve approval to declare dividends on our preferred stock 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the applicable regulatory agencies will grant our requests in full or in part 
additionally  banctrust s million note payable secured by the stock of the bank matures in october of in order to satisfy this obligation  banctrust must either complete an equity offering prior to maturity in a sufficient amount to enable repayment  renew the note payable or obtain a new loan 
the fdic as receiver for silverton bank  n 
a 
is the holder of the note payable  and any renewal of the note would require fdic approval 
in addition  we are currently required to obtain approval from the federal reserve bank of atlanta prior to incurring additional debt or modifying or refinancing the terms of existing debt 
we believe that completing an equity offering sufficient to repay the note is the best option at this time  however  we will seek fdic and federal reserve approval for a renewal of the note if the capital markets are not receptive to such an offering by october we intend to also pursue a new loan  the proceeds of which would be used to repay the fdic as receiver for silverton bank  however  we believe obtaining such a loan in the near term on acceptable terms is unlikely based on current banking industry and economic conditions and our recent financial performance 
management will continue to analyze its options for repayment  renewal or replacement of this note payable over the en suing months and undertake what it deems to be the company s best available course of action within the required timeframe 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide an analysis of cash from operating  investing  and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities used million in compared to million provided in and million provided in net cash from investing activities provided million in primarily due to the decrease in loans and the decrease in interest bearing deposits and provided million in primarily from the decrease in loans 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in  due primarily to the decrease in deposits of million in and million in the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was million in  compared to a net decrease of million in and a net decrease of thousand in we acquired net cash and cash equivalents of million in through the purchase of peoples 
interest rate sensitivity management attempts to maintain a proper balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market by monitoring our interest rate sensitivity 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  we can identify interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities typically change at diffe rent times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liabilities can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of percent earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest rate sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
management evaluates several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  before making adjustments to earning assets 
management tries to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed to maximize net interest revenue while minimizing interest rate risk 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
we have not in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity  however  in the peoples merger  we acquired an interest rate contract 
peoples purchased the interest rate contract to manage interest rate risk in its loan portfolio 
the contract was sold in the first quarter of for a gain of million 
at december   our three month gap position interest earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities was percent  and our twelve month cumulative gap position was percent 
our three month cumulative gap position was within the range established by management as acceptable  but our one year position was slightly out of the range 
our three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of earning assets that reprice upward during the three months would be accompanied by in interest bearing liabilities repricing upward during the same period 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue could be expected to decrease during the three month period of rising rates  as interest expense increases would exceed increases in interest income 
likewise  our twelve m onth gap position indicates that each of interest earning assets that reprices upward during such period would be accompanied by upward repricing of in interest bearing liabilities resulting in a decrease in net interest revenue 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories of liabilities are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most  including deposits  are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
because rates on liabilities are near historic lows  a further decrease in rates would probably not result in an increase in net interest revenue 
management has some flexibility when adjusting rates on these products 
therefore  the repricing of assets and liabilities would not necessarily take place at the same time and in corresponding amounts 
the following table summarizes our interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which their interest rates are scheduled to adjust 
fixed rate loans are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities 
amortizing investment securities are included in the period for which principal payments are scheduled to be made 
non amortizing investment securities are included in the period in which they are scheduled to mature

capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets was million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at year end  our tier capital ratio was  a decrease from at year end both decreases were caused by the decrease in our capital which resulted from our net loss in in the fourth quarter of  we applied to participate in the capital purchase program of the troubled asset relief program and were approved to issue preferred stock to the us treasury 
we completed the sale of million in preferred shares to the united states treasury on december  the preferred shares pay a cumulative annual dividend at the rate of for the first five years 
the dividend will increase to after five years if the preferred shares have not been redeemed by the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred shares  we issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share  which would represent an aggregate investment  if fully exercised of approximately million in banctrust common stock  or of the investment in preferred stock 
our participation resulted in the imposition of certain restrictions including limits on executive compensation and the requirement that we obtain prior approval from the us treasury before increasing our regular quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders above per share 
under the capital purchase program  the company s ability to purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration its common stock or trust preferred securities of its affiliates is restricted until the earlier of a the third anniversary of the issuance of the preferred stock and b the date on which the company has redeemed all of the preferred stock or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties  provided  however  that certain restrictions persist for any period when there are accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock outstanding 
we used million of the proceeds to repay a portion of the bank loan related to the peoples acquisition 
we contributed million in capital to the bank in early in december  we formed a wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary the trust 
the trust issued million of trust preferred securities guaranteed by banctrust on a junior subordinated basis 
we obtained the proceeds from the trust s sale of trust preferred securities by issuing junior subordinated debentures to the trust and used the proceeds to partially finance the purchase price of commercesouth  inc in december  we formed another wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary trust ii 
trust ii issued million of trust preferred securities guaranteed by banctrust on a junior subordinated basis 
we obtained the proceeds from trust ii s sale of trust preferred securities by issuing junior subordinated debentures to trust ii and used the proceeds to r epay million of long term debt and for general corporate purposes 
under gaap  both the trust and trust ii must be deconsolidated with us for accounting purposes 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  the federal reserve board adopted changes to its capital rules with respect to the regulatory capital treatment afforded to trust preferred securities 
the federal reserve board s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included as tier capital up to of core capital 
we believe that our trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and expect that we will continue to treat our million of trust preferred securities as tier capital 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities are added to our tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier capital 
our leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by quarterly average assets  was at year end compared to at year end the federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies and banks to maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
our capital ratios expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  we excee ded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december   and the minimum guidelines are shown in table see management s discussion and analysis capital adequacy  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

results of operations net interest revenue net interest revenue  the difference between amounts earned on interest earning assets and the amounts paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the most significant component of earnings for a financial institution 
major factors influencing net interest revenue are changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities and changes in the asset liability mix 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on interest earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total average interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of our effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
our net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points to percent compared to percent in and percent in from mid through mid  rising interest rates and a large increase in our loan volume resulted in an increase to our net yield 
this trend continued until the federal reserve stopped increasing rates in mid the federal reserve s monetary policy  combined with slower loan growth in  resulted in yield reduction 
in recent years  an increase in the amount of loans placed on non accrual  further reduced our net interest margin 
the rapid decrease in interest rates beginning in the third quarter of was a contributing factor as well 
the current high volume of non performing assets as of december   reduced our net interest margin by approximately to basis points in beginning in the second quarter of  as our deposit base began to stabilize after the financial industry crisis in the fall of  we began reducing the rates paid on our deposits 
also  as liquidity allowed  we increased the size of the investment portfolio in these factors contributed heavily to an improvement in our net interest margin in the third and fourth quarters of in the fourth quarter of  the net interest margin had increased to 
further cuts in interest rates  while not likely  could erode our margin by limiting our ability to offset point for point asset yield reductions with liability costs 
further liability cost reductions will be limited by competition for deposits as well as the inability to aggressively lower deposit rates below the already near historic low levels in some categories 
increases in interest rates could decrease our net interest margin if we are unable to reprice our interest earnings assets faster and to a greater extent than our interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan and lease losses and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to earnings that is added to the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
risk management procedures are in place to assist in identifying potential problem loans 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  economic factors and other risk factors 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recover ies on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan losses charged to income  which increase the allowance 
management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements and possible risks associated with concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report prepared by loan review officers and delivered to management  which uses the report to determine whether any adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are appropriate

all of our restructured loans at december  were accruing interest 
the company only restructures loans for borrowers in financial difficulty that have designed a viable business plan to fully pay off all obligatio ns  including outstanding debt  interest  and fees  either by generating additional income from the business or through liquidation of assets 
generally  these loans are restructured to provide the borrower additional time to execute upon their plans 
the performing restructured loans were not placed in nonaccrual status prior to the restructuring  and since the company expects the borrowers to perform after the restructuring based on modified note terms  the loans continue to accrue interest at the restructured rate 
the company will continue to closely monitor these loans and will cease accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms 
all restructured loans are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the quarterly allowance calculation 
as of december  the allowance for loan losses allocated to restructured loans totaled thousand 
loans on non accrual increased to million from million at december   primarily a result of placing certain real estate loans along our coastal markets on non accrual 
as previously discussed  the real estate markets along our gulf coast markets have experienced a substantial slow down 
management anticipates foreclosing on certain loans in the gulf coast market and has established an amount in the allowance for loan losses to cover the anticipated losses on these loans 
these anticipated losses were considered in management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
management continues to monitor these loans and other real estate loans along our coastal markets and meets regularly with local bank personnel to discuss and evaluate these loans  other potential problem loans  and the overall economic conditions within the market

the first line of responsibility for the monitoring of credit quality and the assignment of risk grades based on policy guidelines to individual loans is the loan officer 
the loan review function  which reports to the board  assesses the accuracy of risk grading and performs periodic reviews of the overall credit and underwriting process 
the evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is quantified as the allowance for loan and lease losses that is reported in the company s financial statements 
the overall determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves significant judgment 
factors that affect this judgment are reviewed quarterly in response to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance is comprised of amounts needed for losses on criticized loans and amounts needed to cover historical losses on homogeneous groups of loans not subject to criticism 
historical loss factors are modified based on general economic conditions and other environmental risk factors 
loans subject to criticism through the company s risk grading process totaled million at december   a figure representing percent of total loans  and an increase of million from december  the range of risk grades identifies loans on a spectrum from loans that warrant close monitoring due to potential weakness to loans with a high probability of loss 
management classifies certain loans as criticized loans 
criticized loans are further classified as doubtful  substandard  or special mention 
criticized loans are those loans which management considers to have greater risk that the borrower will not repay in full all contractual principal and interest 
all non performing loans are classified as criticized loans 
performing loans may be classified as criticized loans based on payment history  the financial condition of the borrower  or other factors management considers to raise doubt as to the borrower s willingness and ability to repay 
a deterioration of collateral values underlying the loans does not in itself lead to a loan being criticized 
an individual report on each criticized loan over million is completed quarterly by bank personnel 
this report provides an update on information about the loan as well as an update of the action plan for the ultimate collection of the loan 
this report includes information on the value of underlying collateral 
real estate collateral is valued primarily based on outside appraisals although some real estate collateral is based on an internal evaluation 
real estate collateral values are updated periodically 
the geographic concentration of criticized loans in the northwest florida region was the direct result of the deterioration in real estate values in this area 
the majority of criticized loans in northwest florida are land and land development loans 
once the rapid deterioration in real estate values commenced  many developers in this area were no longer able to complete projects  and conversion of their properties could not be completed 
total charge offs in the northwest florida region was approximately million  which represented percent of total charge offs  during in order to monitor the movement in collateral values for real properties in the northwest florida region  management undertook a study to determine to what extent real estate values had deteriorated in this market based on type of property 
from this analysis  management was able to discount prior appraisals in order to determine current collateral values 
these values were then compared to current loan balances in order to establish a loss reserve allocation 
in addition  management requires its loan officers to submit reports on loan status and collateral valuation on a quarterly basis for classified loans over million in order to closely monitor insufficient collateral positions and make necessary changes to loss reserve allocations 
likewise  in order to more closely monitor declines in real estate values in other geographic areas  management engaged outside consultants to determine average deterioration in real estate values in the coastal alabama area  and certain geographic areas in central alabama 
the majority of criticized loans in the central alabama region were commercial real estate  mostly construction  land  and land development loans 
the primary criticized construction  land  and land development loans in the central alabama region were located in the montgomery county  autauga county  and lake martin areas  which also saw significant declines in real estate values 
management has engaged an outside consultant to analyze average deteriorations in real property values in order to apply discounts to prior appraisals to determine current property values 
this analysis is being used by management in determining loss reserve allocations for these specific loans

the volume of non sufficient funds nsf activity  fees for which are included in service charge income  has decreased significantly 
management believes part of this decrease is due to customers more diligently monitoring their personal accounts in this period of continued economic recession and to the increased use of debit cards  which do not generate nsf fees  as transactions for which our customers do not have available funds are declined at the point of sale instead of posting to the account and generating a nsf charge 
this decrease in service charge income was offset in part by a decrease in checking account charge offs 
trust revenue decreased thousand  or percent 
the average level of the stock markets in compared to contributed to the decline  as fees on many trust accounts are based on the value of the trust

we believe the slow down in our coastal markets was originally attributable to the severe storms in and and to the inability  in certain circumstances  to obtain adequate insurance on real estate within these markets 
the decreased volume in was exacerbated by the overall slow down in real estate markets and the broader economy

increased levels of bank owned life insurance and municipal interest income combined with lower levels of pre tax income led to the tax benefit 
our effective combined tax rate was percent in inflation and other issues because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on our assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by management s ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation
