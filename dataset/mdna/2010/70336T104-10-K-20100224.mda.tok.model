item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading producer of thermal coal in the eastern us  with operations and coal reserves in appalachia and the illinois basin  our operating segments 
we are also a leading us producer of metallurgical quality coal 
our principal business is the mining  preparation and sale of thermal coal  for sale primarily to electric utilities  as well as the mining of metallurgical coal  for sale to steel mills and independent coke producers 
our operations consist of fourteen current mining complexes  which include company operated mines  contractor operated mines and coal preparation facilities 
the appalachia and illinois basin segments consist of our operations in west virginia and kentucky  respectively 
we ship coal to electric utilities  industrial users  steel mills and independent coke producers 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to domestic electric utilities and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to domestic electric utilities and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
coal is shipped via various company owned and third party loading facilities  multiple rail and river transportation routes and ocean going vessels 
we typically sell coal to utility and steel making customers under contracts with terms of one year or more 
approximately and of our sales were under such contracts during and  respectively 
effective october   patriot was spun off from peabody 
the spin off was accomplished through a dividend of all outstanding shares of patriot  resulting in patriot becoming a separate  public company traded on the new york stock exchange symbol pcx 
on july   patriot completed the acquisition of magnum 
magnum was one of the largest coal producers in appalachia  operating eight mining complexes with production from surface and underground mines and controlling more than million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
magnum s results are included as of the date of the acquisition 

table of contents results of operations segment adjusted ebitda the discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our appalachia and illinois basin segments adjusted ebitda results 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss before deducting net interest income and expense  income taxes  reclamation and remediation obligation expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  restructuring and impairment charge  and net sales contract accretion 
net sales contract accretion represents contract accretion excluding back to back coal purchase and sales contracts 
the contract accretion on the back to back coal purchase and sales contracts reflects the accretion related to certain coal purchase and sales contracts existing on july   whereby magnum purchased coal from third parties to fulfill tonnage commitments on sales contracts 
segment adjusted ebitda is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance 
because segment adjusted ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies  our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in item selected consolidated financial data 
segment adjusted ebitda is calculated the same as adjusted ebitda but also excludes selling  general and administrative expenses  past mining obligation expense and gain on disposal or exchange of assets and is reconciled to its most comparable measure below  under net income 
geologic conditions our results of operations are impacted by geologic conditions as they relate to coal mining 
these conditions refer to the physical nature of the coal seam and surrounding strata and its effect on the mining process 
geologic conditions that can have an adverse effect on underground mining include thinning coal seam thickness  rock partings within a coal seam  weak roof or floor rock  sandstone channel intrusions  groundwater and increased stresses within the surrounding rock mass due to over mining  under mining and overburden changes 
the term adverse geologic conditions is used in general to refer to these and similar situations where the geologic setting can negatively affect the normal mining process 
adverse geologic conditions would be markedly different from those that would be considered typical geologic conditions for a given mine 
since approximately of our production was sourced from underground operations  geologic conditions can be a major factor in our results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary revenues were  million  an increase of million  and segment adjusted ebitda was million  an increase of million  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue and segment adjusted ebitda resulted from the addition of magnum  the successful implementation of our management action plan and improved performance at our longwall mines 
beginning in the third quarter of  the global recession resulted in decreased worldwide demand for steel and electricity  leading to weakened coal markets 
early in  we implemented a management action plan as a strategic response to the weakened coal markets 
the management action plan included output and cost reductions  workforce and capital redeployment and sales contract renegotiations 
as a result of this plan  during we suspended certain company operated and contract mines  including suspension of operations at our samples surface mine  deferred production start up at one newly developed mining complex and cancelled certain operating shifts at various other mining complexes 
additionally  we restructured certain below market legacy coal supply agreements 
our results reflect the inclusion of a full year of the magnum operations  which were acquired on july  the increased revenue from the acquired magnum operations was partially offset by lower customer demand throughout the year and increased customer deferrals during both our federal and panther longwalls encountered some adverse geologic conditions in  but significantly less than the difficulties encountered in the improved production in reflects the benefits of mine plan adjustments made in late to minimize the impact of difficult geology 
in the third quarter of  significant upgrades were made to certain components of the panther longwall mining equipment 
both of the longwalls were performing well by the end of in the fourth quarter of  federal had its best production quarter in and panther had its best quarter since the magnum acquisition

these increases were partially offset by lower customer demand and increased customer deferrals 
sales volumes in the appalachia segment increased in  primarily from the incremental million tons sold from the acquired magnum operations  partially offset by the overall decline in customer demand for both metallurgical and thermal coal including lower sales due to customer shipment deferrals and settlements 
the overall decline in customer demand led to the suspension of certain operations and decreased operating shifts at other operations 
illinois basin revenue decreased slightly in compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume caused by lower customer demand  unfavorable weather conditions early in the year and increased downtime due to regulatory inspections 
lower sales volumes were partially offset by higher average sales prices 
appalachia other revenue was higher in primarily due to cash settlements received for reduced shipments as a result of renegotiated customer agreements 
in addition to royalty income  appalachia other revenue in included a structured settlement on a property transaction  a settlement for past due coal royalties which had previously been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of collection  and gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter 

table of contents segment operating costs and expenses segment operating costs and expenses represent consolidated operating costs and expenses less past mining obligations 
segment operating costs and expenses for appalachia increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental million of costs for the full year of the acquired magnum operations 
excluding the impact of magnum  operating costs were higher due to increased purchased coal million and increased materials and supplies costs primarily related to equipment rebuilds at various locations million 
we purchased coal to cover certain sales commitments at some of our suspended operations 
the increased costs were partially offset by decreased labor costs primarily due to reduced shifts and mine suspensions as a result of lower customer demand million and lower royalties resulting from decreased production at certain mines million 
operating costs and expenses for illinois basin decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased costs for purchased coal million and lower diesel fuel and explosives costs million 
in  higher priced spot sale opportunities were available which resulted in more purchased coal to fulfill sales commitments 
the decreased costs were partially offset by higher repair and maintenance and outside services costs primarily due to major non recurring repairs including equipment rebuilds  belting and component upgrades million 
segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia increased in from the prior year primarily due to the contribution from the additional volume associated with the acquired magnum operations 
additionally  during  we received cash settlements for reduced shipments 
these cash settlements approximated the financial impact associated with cancelled customer commitments 
segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin decreased in primarily due to lower production volumes attributable to lower customer demand and severe winter storms 
this decrease also reflected higher repair and maintenance and outside services costs that were primarily due to major non recurring repairs including equipment rebuilds  belting and component upgrades 
these decreases were partially offset by higher average sales prices and lower diesel fuel and explosives costs

these increases were partially offset by lower spending at our closed locations million 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount and expenses due to the addition and integration of magnum operations  which were acquired july  
table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the full year impact from the addition of the magnum assets 
reclamation and remediation obligation expense reclamation and remediation obligation expense increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to the full year impact from the acquisition of magnum 
sales contract accretion sales contract accretion resulted from the below market coal sale and purchase contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition and recorded at fair value in purchase accounting 
the net liability generated from applying fair value to these contracts is being accreted over the life of the contracts as the coal is shipped 
restructuring and impairment charge the restructuring and impairment charge in related to certain infrastructure and thermal coal reserves near our rocklick complex that were deemed uneconomical to mine  as well as a restructuring charge related to the discontinued use of a beltline into the rocklick preparation plant during the fourth quarter 
interest expense interest expense increased for compared to the prior year primarily due to interest and debt discount expense related to our convertible notes that were issued in may and higher letter of credit fees related to the magnum acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by the commitment fee expensed due to the termination of a bridge loan facility related to our assumption of magnum s debt during the second quarter of see liquidity and capital resources for details concerning our outstanding debt and credit facility 
income tax provision for the years ended december  and  no income tax provision was recorded due to net operating losses for the year and our full valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
for and  the primary difference between book and taxable income was the treatment of the net sales contract accretion on the below market purchase and sales contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition  with such amounts being included in the computation of book income but excluded from the computation of taxable income 
basis of presentation related to periods prior to the spin off from peabody the statements of operations and cash flows for the twelve months ended december   and related discussions below primarily relate to our historical results prior to the spin off from peabody 
these results may not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and cash flows would have been as a stand alone company 
the consolidated financial statements presented herein for this period includes allocations of peabody expenses  assets and liabilities through the date of the spin off  including the following items selling and administrative expenses for the periods prior to spin off  our historical selling and administrative expenses were based on an allocation of peabody general corporate expenses to all of its mining operations  both foreign and domestic  based on principal activity  headcount  tons sold or revenues as appropriate 
the allocated expenses generally reflect service costs for marketing and sales  general accounting  legal  finance and treasury  public relations  human resources  environmental  engineering and internal audit 
interest expense for the periods prior to the spin off  our historical interest expense primarily related to fees for letters of credit and surety bonds used to guarantee our reclamation  workers compensation  retiree healthcare and lease obligations as well as interest expense related to intercompany notes with peabody 
our capital structure changed following our spin off from peabody  and effective october   we entered into a four year revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility for information about our credit facility 
the intercompany notes totaling million with peabody were forgiven at spin off 
income tax provision income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach in accordance with authoritative guidance 
we account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance sheet to differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  we consider projected realization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the overall deferred tax position 

table of contents authoritative guidance specifies that the amount of current and deferred tax expense for an income tax return group are to be allocated among the members of that group when those members issue separate financial statements 
for purposes of the consolidated financial statements prepared for the twelve months ended december  and for the other periods prior to the spin off  our income tax expense was recorded as if we filed a consolidated tax return separate from peabody  notwithstanding that a majority of the operations were historically included in the us consolidated income tax return filed by peabody 
our valuation allowance for these periods was also determined on the separate tax return basis 
additionally  our tax attributes ie  net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits for these periods have been determined based on us consolidated tax rules describing the apportionment of these items upon departure spin off from the peabody consolidated group 
peabody was managing its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses 
peabody s tax strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would have followed or have followed as a stand alone company  nor were they necessarily strategies that optimized our stand alone position 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary revenues were  million  an increase of million  and segment adjusted ebitda was million  an increase of million  for the year ended december  net income attributable to patriot was million in compared to a net loss attributable to patriot of million in the increase in revenue  segment adjusted ebitda and net income attributable to patriot was mainly driven by the newly acquired magnum operations including the impact of purchase accounting 
the results of operations of magnum are included in the appalachia mining operations segment from the date of acquisition 
was a volatile year in the coal markets 
coal prices significantly increased during the first half of the year  peaked in july and then declined in the later part of the year in conjunction with the overall economic downturn 
sales for our appalachia and illinois basin segments reflected higher contract and spot prices 
offsetting this increase  several of our mining complexes experienced adverse geologic conditions that impacted production levels as well as higher costs related to labor  fuel  and materials and supplies

table of contents tons sold and revenues the increase in appalachia revenue for the year ended december  compared to primarily related to million of sales associated with the newly acquired magnum operations 
excluding the impact of magnum  revenues were also affected by higher average sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes at the federal and rocklick mining complexes 
average sales prices increased at our mining complexes  reflecting higher sales contract pricing  including the repricing of a major coal supply agreement with peabody as part of the spin off  and cost recovery under certain contracts for increased regulatory costs 
sales volumes in the appalachia segment increased in  primarily due to million tons sold from the newly acquired magnum operations 
excluding magnum  sales volume decreased primarily due to production shortfalls at our federal complex  the completion of the final longwall panel at the harris mine during the second quarter  labor shortages for much of the year and reduced productivity at several mines 
illinois basin revenue increased in primarily related to higher average sales prices 
compared to the prior year  sales volumes increased slightly 
other appalachia revenues increased in in addition to increased royalty income  other revenues included a structured settlement on a property transaction  a settlement for past due coal royalties  which had previously been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of collection  and gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter 
segment operating costs and expenses segment operating costs and expenses represent consolidated operating costs and expenses less past mining obligations 
operating costs and expenses for appalachia increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to million of costs associated with the newly acquired magnum operations 
excluding the impact of magnum  operating costs were higher in due to start up costs as we ramped up production at our big mountain million and kanawha eagle million mining complexes  as well as higher contract mining costs million primarily related to higher material and supply and labor costs 
material and supply costs were primarily impacted by higher fuel  explosives and steel related costs 
higher labor costs were reflective of an overall labor shortage in the appalachia region 
operating costs and expenses for illinois basin increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased costs for purchased coal million  increased labor costs million and higher materials and supplies cost due to higher diesel fuel  explosives and steel related costs million 
purchased coal resulted from diverting tons to higher priced spot sales and fulfilling sales commitments with purchased tons 
segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia increased in from the prior year primarily due to the contribution from the newly acquired magnum operations and  to a lesser extent  higher sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher operating costs as described above 
segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia also increased in due to the previously mentioned gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter and the structured settlements in the second quarter 
segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin increased in primarily due to higher average sales prices  offset by increased labor costs and higher diesel fuel  explosives and steel related costs as described above

past mining obligation expense at the newly acquired magnum operations totaled million for the period beginning july   the acquisition date  primarily associated with retiree healthcare liabilities 
net gain on disposal or exchange of assets net gain on disposal or exchange of assets was million lower for compared to the prior year 
the net gain on disposal or exchange of assets for included a million gain on the exchange sale of certain leasehold mineral interests 
the net gain on disposal or exchange of assets for included coal reserve transactions that resulted in gains of million 
selling and administrative expenses our historical selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were based on an allocation of peabody general corporate expenses to all of its mining operations  both foreign and domestic 
selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  represent our actual expenses incurred as a stand alone company  including expenses from the newly acquired magnum operations  which overall were lower than the prior year allocation 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the additional sales volume associated with the acquisition of magnum 
sales contract accretion sales contract accretion resulted from the below market coal sale and purchase contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition and recorded at fair value in purchase accounting 
the net liability generated from applying fair value to these contracts is being accreted over the life of the contracts as the coal is shipped 
reclamation and remediation obligation expense reclamation and remediation obligation expense decreased in compared to the prior year primarily due to accelerated reclamation work at closed mines in the first half of  the acceleration of a mine closure in early  and the extension of the life of our federal mine in mid as a result of the acquisition of adjoining coal reserves  largely offset by expenses related to the newly acquired magnum operations 

table of contents interest expense income interest expense increased for compared to primarily due to amortized debt discount and debt origination fees related to our may convertible debt issuance  interest and a commitment fee expensed in the second quarter due to the termination of a bridge loan facility related to the magnum acquisition 
additionally  amortized origination debt fees related to our credit facility put in place at the time of the spin off also increased interest expense in these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense related to a demand note with peabody which was forgiven at the spin off  resulting in no similar interest expense in see liquidity and capital resources for details concerning our outstanding debt and credit facility 
interest income increased in compared to the prior year due to interest on a black lung excise tax refund 
in addition  we recognized a full year of interest income on notes receivable that resulted from the sale of coal reserves in the first half of income tax provision for the years ended december  and  no income tax provision was recorded due to net operating losses for the year and our full valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
for  the primary difference between book and taxable income was the treatment of the net sales contract accretion on the below market purchase and sales contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition  with such amounts being included in the computation of book income but excluded from the computation of taxable income 
noncontrolling interest we acquired an effective controlling interest in ke ventures  llc during the first quarter of  and began consolidating ke ventures  llc in our results in the portion of earnings that represents the interests of the noncontrolling owners was deducted from our net income loss to determine net income loss attributable to patriot 
the noncontrolling interest recorded in represented the share of ke ventures  llc earnings in which the noncontrolling holders were entitled to participate 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased our ownership in ke ventures  llc to 
effect of noncontrolling interest purchase arrangement at the spin off  the noncontrolling interest holders of ke ventures  llc held an option that could require patriot to purchase the remaining of ke ventures  llc upon a change in control 
upon the spin off from peabody  the noncontrolling owners of ke ventures  llc exercised this option  and we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interest in ke ventures  llc on november  for million 
because the option requiring patriot to purchase ke ventures  llc is considered a mandatorily redeemable instrument outside of our control  amounts paid to the noncontrolling interest holders in excess of carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in ke ventures  llc  or million  was reflected as an increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders in this obligation was fully redeemed as of december  outlook market market indicators are showing signs of increased strength in the metallurgical and thermal coal markets 
asian economies are recovering rapidly and are importing metallurgical coal at a robust pace 
idled steel mill capacity is being restarted around the globe 
european and brazilian metallurgical markets are poised to expand further  while us steel markets have stabilized 
although us coal producers have not historically shipped large quantities of metallurgical coal to asia  increased demand in asian markets could begin to pull more us coal to asian destinations 
demand for thermal coal has increased and inventory levels have begun to decline as a result of higher natural gas prices  coupled with the extremely cold temperatures experienced in the us during december and january additionally  colder temperatures have also begun to draw down natural gas inventories 
because of surface mine permitting issues and more extensive safety regulations and inspections  as well as more difficult geology  central appalachia may be the first us coal basin to come into balance as thermal coal markets continue to strengthen 
improving domestic and world economies will result in higher industrial production and electricity usage  which should result in higher thermal coal demand and decreased thermal coal inventories both in the us and overseas

risk factors  our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by unforeseen adverse geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations  customer performance and credit risks  the economic recession  reductions of purchases or deferral of deliveries by major customers  the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine  increase our mining costs  or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation  environmental and coal mining laws and regulations  the availability and costs of credit  surety bonds and letters of credit  the inability of contract miners to fulfill delivery terms of their contracts  delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain required permits for new mining operations  and the unavailability of transportation for coal shipments 
on a long term basis  our results of operations could also be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves  our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and contract miners  our ability to find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts  and rising prices of key supplies  mining equipment and commodities 
potential legislation  regulation  treaties and accords at the local  state  federal and international level have created uncertainty and could have a significant impact on our customers  demand for coal and our future operational and financial results 
for example  increased scrutiny of surface mining permits could cause production delays in the future 
the lack of proven technology to meet selenium discharge standards creates uncertainty as to the future costs of water treatment to comply with mining permits 
the regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our customers and significantly impact the demand for coal 
see item a 
risk factors for expanded discussion of these factors 
if upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
management has continued to focus on controlling costs  optimizing performance and responding quickly to market changes 
we are seeing positive results from our ongoing emphasis on cash and cost control  as well as rationalization of higher cost production 
we performed a comprehensive strategic review of our mining complexes and their relative cost structures in conjunction with the magnum acquisition 
as a result  we idled our jupiter mining complex effective december  and the remington complex effective march  additionally  we implemented a management action plan in early in response to the weakened coal markets 
in january  we announced the idling of our black oak mine 
on april   we announced additional contract mine suspensions  the deferral of the opening of the blue creek complex and the cancellation of certain operating shifts at various mining complexes 
in addition  on august   we announced the suspension of our samples surface mine due to its higher cost structure relative to our other operations 
both our federal and panther longwalls encountered some adverse geologic conditions in  but significantly less than the difficulties encountered in the improved production in reflects the benefits of mine plan adjustments made in late to minimize the impact of difficult geology 
in the third quarter of  significant upgrades were made to certain components of the panther longwall mining equipment 
both of the longwalls were performing well by the end of in the fourth quarter of  federal had its best production quarter in and panther had its best quarter since the magnum acquisition 
on february   we announced that active mining operations at our federal mine in northern west virginia were temporarily suspended upon discovering potentially adverse atmospheric conditions on february   in an abandoned area of the mine 
we are currently conducting additional testing and working with the us department of labor  mine safety health administration to develop a plan to address this issue so that active mining operations can resume  the timing of which is currently uncertain 
the federal mine complex historically accounts for between and of our segment adjusted ebitda 
we anticipate sales volume in the range of to million tons 
this includes metallurgical coal sales of at least million tons 
we are targeting higher metallurgical coal volumes in from existing operations as a result of the strengthening market

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents employee related liabilities we have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
expense for the year ended december  for these liabilities totaled million  while payments were million 
postretirement benefits and certain components of our workers compensation obligations are actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for these items 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree healthcare and work related injuries and illness obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
our most significant employee liability is postretirement healthcare 
assumed discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for postretirement healthcare plans 
below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
healthcare cost trend rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation discount rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations also referred to as reclamation primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both underground and surface mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including  among other items  estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities 
asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended december   was million  and payments totaled million 
see detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations are included in reclamation and remediation obligation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
remediation obligations our remediation obligations primarily consist of the estimated liability for water treatment in order to comply with selenium effluent limits included in certain mining permits 
this liability reflects the discounted estimated costs of the treatment systems to be installed and maintained with the goal of meeting the requirements of current court orders  consent decrees and mining permits 
this estimate was prepared considering the dynamics of current legislation  capabilities of currently available technology and our planned remediation strategy 
the exact amount of our assumed liability is uncertain due to the fact there is no proven technology to remediate our existing selenium discharges in excess of allowable limits to meet current permit standards 
if technology becomes available that meets permit standards or if the standards change in the future  our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
remediation obligation expense for the year ended december  was million and payments totaled million 
see detailed information regarding our remediation obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
remediation obligations are included in reclamation and remediation obligation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
as of december  and  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
uncertain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on future tax returns are reflected in the measurement of current and deferred taxes 
the initial recognition process is a two step process with a recognition threshold step and a step to measure the benefit 
a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the merits of the position 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to be recognized based on a best estimate measurement of the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  the unrecognized tax benefits are immaterial  and if recognized would not currently affect our effective tax rate as any recognition would be offset with a valuation allowance 
we do not expect any significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of this reporting date 
additional detail regarding how we account for income taxes and the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in note revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned 
we generated substantially all of our revenues in from the sale of coal to our customers 
revenues from coal sales are realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer 
coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements  most of which have a term of one year or more 
under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customer at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  ocean going vessel  truck or other transportation source that delivers coal to its destination 
with respect to other revenues  other operating income  or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate 
we do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
derivatives we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain commodity prices 
authoritative guidance requires the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges  the periodic change in fair value is recorded directly to earnings 
for derivative instruments that qualify and are designated by us as cash flow hedges  the periodic change in fair value is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss until the contract settles or the relationship ceases to qualify for hedge accounting 
in addition  if a portion of the change in fair value for a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective during a reporting period  the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded directly to earnings 
we entered into heating oil swap contracts to manage our exposure to diesel fuel prices 
the changes in diesel fuel and heating oil prices are highly correlated  thus allowing the swap contracts to be designated as cash flow hedges 
share based compensation we have an equity incentive plan for employees and eligible non employee directors that allows for the issuance of share based compensation in the form of restricted stock  incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  performance awards  restricted stock units and deferred stock units 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and an applicable lattice pricing model to determine the fair value of certain market based performance awards 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility  and a risk free interest rate 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets under various assumptions are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the impaired asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment charge was recorded at december  related to certain infrastructure and thermal coal reserves near our rocklick complex that were deemed uneconomical to mine 
business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers  sales of non core assets and financing transactions 
our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production  capital expenditures  interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt interest and principal and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations or borrowed funds as necessary 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities related to the use of working capital of million  offset by improved operating results of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash used reflected lower capital expenditures of million  a decrease of cash used for investment in joint ventures of million and higher cash proceeds from notes receivable of million  partially offset by a decrease in net cash acquired from acquisitions of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities reflected a million change in short term borrowings on our credit facility and a decrease of million in gross proceeds from the convertible note received in these decreases were partially offset by the million in net proceeds from the equity offering in and the termination of magnum s debt facility in for million 
on june   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock in a registered public offering under our shelf registration at per share 
the net proceeds from the sale of shares  after deducting fees and commissions  were million 
the proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
credit facility effective october   we entered into a million  four year revolving credit facility  which includes a million swingline sub facility and a letter of credit sub facility  subsequently amended for the magnum acquisition and the issuance of the convertible notes 
in july  we increased our revolving credit facility by million  bringing the total credit facility to million 
this facility is available for our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
as of december   the balance of outstanding letters of credit issued against the credit facility totaled million 
as of december   the balance of outstanding letters of credit issued against the credit facility totaled million  and million short term borrowings were outstanding under the sub facility 
the weighted average effective interest rate of the sub facility was as of december  there were no short term borrowings outstanding as of december  availability under the credit facility was million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents the obligations under our credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including but not limited to certain of our mines and coal reserves and related fixtures 
the credit facility contains certain customary covenants  including financial covenants limiting our total indebtedness maximum leverage ratio of and requiring minimum ebitda as defined in the credit facility coverage of interest expense minimum interest coverage ratio of  as well as certain limitations on  among other things  additional debt  liens  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures  future dividends and asset sales 
the credit facility calls for quarterly reporting of compliance with financial covenants 
the terms of the credit facility also contain certain customary events of default  which gives the lenders the right to accelerate payments of outstanding debt in certain circumstances 
customary events of default include breach of covenants  failure to maintain required ratios  failure to make principal payments or to make interest or fee payments within a grace period  and default  beyond any applicable grace period  on any of our other indebtedness exceeding a certain amount 
in connection with the merger agreement with magnum  we entered into an amendment dated as of april  to the credit facility 
the amendment among other things  i permitted the merger with magnum and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement  ii increased the rate of interest applicable to loans and letters of credit fees under the credit facility and iii modified certain covenants and related definitions to allow for changes in permitted indebtedness  permitted liens  permitted capital expenditures and other changes in respect of patriot and its subsidiaries in connection with the acquisition 
the increase in the interest rate and the covenant modifications were effective with the closing of the acquisition 
in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes discussed below  we entered into an amendment to the credit facility dated as of may   allowing the issuance of the convertible notes and modifying certain covenants for the period prior to the closing of the magnum acquisition 
on september   we entered into an amendment to the credit facility allowing  among other things  an increase to the permitted securitization programs without adjusting the capacity of the credit facility 
at december  we were in compliance with the covenants of our amended credit facility 
private convertible notes issuance on may   we completed a private offering of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes  including million related to the underwriters overallotment option 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting the initial purchasers commissions and fees and expenses of the offering 
as discussed in note  we adopted authoritative guidance related to accounting for convertible debt effective january   with retrospective application to the issuance date of these convertible notes 
we utilized an interest rate of to reflect the nonconvertible market rate of our offering upon issuance  which resulted in a million discount to the convertible note balance and an increase to additional paid in capital to reflect the value of the conversion feature 
the nonconvertible market interest rate was based on an analysis of similar securities trading in the market at the pricing date of the issuance  taking into account company specific data such as credit spreads and implied volatility 
in addition  we allocated the financing costs related to the issuance of the convertible instruments between the debt and equity components 
the debt discount is amortized over the contractual life of the convertible notes  resulting in additional interest expense above the contractual coupon amount 
at december   the principal amount of the convertible notes of million was adjusted for the debt discount of million  resulting in a long term convertible note balance of million 
at december   the debt discount was million  resulting in a long term convertible note balance of million 
for the year ended december   interest expense for the convertible notes was million  which included debt discount amortization of million 
for the year ended december   interest expense for the convertible notes was million  which included debt discount amortization of million 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the notes mature on may   unless converted  repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and are senior to any subordinated debt 
we used the proceeds of the offering to repay magnum s existing senior secured indebtedness and acquisition related fees and expenses 
all remaining amounts were used for other general corporate purposes 
the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of patriot s common stock during the period from issuance to february   subject to certain conditions of conversion as described below 
the conversion rate for the notes is shares of patriot s common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate and the conversion price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a future stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend 
the notes require us to settle all conversions by paying cash for the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the notes  and by settling any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in cash or shares  at our option 

table of contents holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding february   only under the following circumstances during the five trading day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day  during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending september   and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day  if such holder s notes have been called for redemption or upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the indenture 
the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time from  and including  february  until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
the number of shares of patriot s common stock that we may deliver upon conversion will depend on the price of our common stock during an observation period as described in the indenture 
specifically  the number of shares deliverable upon conversion will increase as the common stock price increases above the conversion price of per share during the observation period 
the maximum number of shares that we may deliver is  however  if certain fundamental changes occur in patriot s business that are deemed make whole fundamental changes in the indenture  the number of shares deliverable on conversion may increase  up to a maximum amount of  shares 
these maximum amounts are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of our notes upon a fundamental change in our business  as defined in the indenture 
the holders would receive cash for of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
patriot may redeem i some or all of the notes at any time on or after may   but only if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date we provide the relevant notice of redemption exceeds of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day  or ii all of the notes if at any time less than million in aggregate principal amount of notes remain outstanding 
in both cases  notes will be redeemed for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  the relevant redemption date 
under the indenture for the notes  if we fail to timely file any document or report required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended  other than reports on form k  we are required to pay additional interest on the notes of of the principal balance of the notes 
this additional interest feature is considered an embedded derivative 
management has determined the fair value of this embedded derivative is de minimis as the probability of reports not being filed timely is remote and we have no history of late submissions 
the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  or any state securities laws 
the notes were only offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a promulgated under the securities act 
bridge loan facility in connection with the magnum acquisition agreement  we obtained a subordinated bridge loan financing commitment  allowing us to draw up to million under the related bridge loan facility at the effective date of the acquisition to repay a portion of the outstanding debt of magnum

table of contents newly adopted accounting pronouncements fasb accounting standards codification in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification tm codification which has become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification has become nonauthoritative 
the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics within a consistent structure  its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance 
consistent with the codification  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standard updates 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  debt in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which changed the accounting for our convertible notes  specifying that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may settle in cash upon conversion must bifurcate the proceeds from the debt issuance between debt and equity components in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the equity component reflects the value of the conversion feature of the notes 
we adopted this authoritative guidance effective january   with retrospective application to the issuance date of our convertible notes 
see note for additional disclosures 
earnings per share in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which states that instruments granted in share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents before vesting should be considered participating securities and need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
the two class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
we adopted this authoritative guidance effective january  with all prior period earnings per share data adjusted retrospectively 
the calculations of earnings per share amounts presented in this report include all participating securities as required by this authoritative guidance 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding business combinations 
the guidance defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred 
the guidance also requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date to be measured at their acquisition date fair values 
this authoritative guidance is effective for any business combination with an acquisition date on or after january  consolidation in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary is required to be displayed in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity  and the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is required to be included in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  this guidance requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance effective january   with retrospective application to the periods presented in this report 

table of contents fair value measurements and disclosures in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measures 
this guidance clarifies that fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we elected to implement the guidance with the one year deferral permitted by subsequent guidance 
the deferral applied to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination 
as of january   we adopted the fair value guidance  including applying its provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination 
the adoption of this guidance did not change the valuation approach or materially change the purchase accounting for the magnum acquisition  which was finalized in the second quarter of subsequent events in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
entities are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
we adopted this guidance effective june  pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets which requires enhanced disclosures about the continuing risk exposure to a transferor because of its continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
consolidation in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires a company to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
in addition  a company is required to assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio is referred to as market risk 
due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term  illiquid nature of the positions  we have not quantified market risk related to our portfolio of coal supply agreements 
we manage our commodity price risk for our coal contracts through the use of long term coal supply agreements  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we sold of our sales volume under coal supply agreements with terms of one year or more during as of december  our total unpriced planned production for was approximately to million tons 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into long term coal contracts with marketing affiliates of peabody 
the arrangements  except as described below under credit risk  have substantially similar terms and conditions as the pre existing contractual obligations of peabody s marketing affiliate 
these arrangements may be amended or terminated only with the mutual agreement of peabody and patriot 
we have commodity risk related to our diesel fuel purchases 
to manage this risk  we have entered into swap contracts with financial institutions 
these derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated diesel fuel purchases 
as of february   the notional amounts outstanding for these swaps included million gallons of heating oil expiring throughout and million gallons of heating oil expiring throughout we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel annually 
aside from these hedging activities  a per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would impact our annual operating costs by approximately million 
credit risk a significant portion of our revenues is generated through sales to a marketing affiliate of peabody  and we will continue to supply coal to peabody on a contract basis as described above  so peabody can meet its commitments under pre existing customer agreements sourced from our operations 
the pre existing customer arrangement between patriot and peabody with the longest term will expire on december  our remaining sales are made directly to electric utilities  industrial companies and steelmakers 
therefore  our concentration of credit risk is with peabody  as well as electric utilities and steelmakers 

table of contents our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended 
in the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards  we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to mitigate our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations 
these steps may include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay 
while the economic recession may affect our customers  we do not anticipate that it will significantly affect our overall credit risk profile due to our credit policies 
additionally  as of december   we had million in notes receivable outstanding from a single counterparty  arising out of the sale of coal reserves and surface land 
each of these notes contains a cross collaterization provision secured primarily by the underlying coal reserves and surface land
