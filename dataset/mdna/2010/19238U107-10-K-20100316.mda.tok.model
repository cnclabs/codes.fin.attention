ffom adds back to traditionally defined ffo non cash amortization of non real estate related intangible assets associated with purchase accounting 
the company presents ffo and ffom because it considers them important supplemental measures of operational performance 
the company believes ffo is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
the company believes that ffom allows securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate current period results to results prior to the mea transaction 
ffo and ffom are intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo and ffom excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  they provide performance measures that  when compared year over year  reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and ffom utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company adjusts the nareit definition to add back noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships before real estate related depreciation and amortization 
further  ffo and ffom do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and ffom should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs  including its ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents the reconciliation of ffo and ffom to net income loss  which is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo and ffom in thousands company predecessor for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended november  january  december  december  december  december  december  october  funds from operations net income loss real estate related depreciation and amortization noncontrolling interests in real estate partnerships  before real estate related depreciation and amortization gain on sale of real estate properties funds from operations amortization of intangibles related to purchase accounting  net of income tax benefit funds from operations modified non recurring events gain on settlement from mea holdings  inc transaction impairment of real estate property held for sale strategic planning professional fees intangible asset impairment charges  net of tax benefit debt extinguishment and interest rate derivative expense  net of tax benefit restructuring and severance charges  net of tax benefit impact of non recurring events ffom  excluding non recurring events real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from wholly owned real estate properties and the company s share of real estate depreciation and amortization from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships

overview the company is a fully integrated  self administered  and self managed reit that invests in specialty office buildings for the medical profession  including medical offices and ambulatory surgery and diagnostic centers 
the company focuses on the ownership  strategic planning  delivery design build  acquisition and management of strategically located medical office buildings and other healthcare related facilities in the united states of america 
the company has been built around understanding and addressing the specialized real estate needs of the healthcare industry  provides services from strategic planning to long term property ownership and management 
integrated delivery service offerings include strategic planning  design  construction  development and project management services for properties owned by the company and for third parties 
the company is building a national portfolio of healthcare properties primarily located on hospital campuses 
since the company s initial public offering in  the company has grown through acquisitions and facility development to encompass a national footprint  including seven regional offices located throughout the united states atlanta  charlotte  dallas  denver  madison  seattle  and washington  dc and property management offices 
client relationships and advance planning services give the company the ability to be included in the initial project discussions that can lead to ownership and investment in healthcare properties 
the company derives a majority of its revenues from two main sources from rents received from tenants under existing leases in medical office buildings and other healthcare related facilities  and from revenue earned from design build construction contracts and development contracts 
to a lesser degree  the company has revenues from consulting and property management agreements 
the company expects that rental revenue will remain stable due to multi year  non cancellable leases with annual rental increases based on the consumer price index cpi 
the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy rate  as of december   for its in service  consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties  due to its focus on customer relationships 
during  the company was able to renew of lease expirations 
generally  the company s property operating revenues and expenses have remained consistent over time except for growth due to property developments and property and business acquisitions 
the demand for the company s design build and development services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature 
financial results can be affected by the amount and timing of capital spending by healthcare systems and providers  the demand for design build and development s services in the healthcare facilities market  the availability of construction level financing  and weather at the construction sites 
in periods of adverse economic conditions  the company s design build and development customers may be unwilling or unable to make capital expenditures and they may be unable to obtain debt or equity financings for projects 
as a result  customers may defer projects to a later date  which could reduce the company s revenues 
due to the adverse economic environment and the volatility in the credit markets experienced in and  the company s design build and development segment experienced delays in client project starts and cancellations 
during  the company signed two design build contracts totaling million related to a project in janesville  wisconsin 
these contracts will generate design build revenue from through the company also signed several advance planning engagements  which may result in future design build contracts 
however  it can take two to months from the time an advance planning project is completed to the time that revenue from a design build contract begins 
as of december   the company expects revenues for the design build and development segment to be comparable to revenues before intersegment eliminations 
however  the company expects a higher percentage of company owned projects to generate revenue compared to third party clients  thus the company expects design build and development revenue after inter segment revenues to decrease compared to the company reviews the value of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
an interim review of the design build and development segment s intangible assets was performed on march   due to a decline in the company s stock price  a decline in the cash flow multiples for comparable public engineering and construction companies  and changes in the cash flow projections for the design build and development segment resulting from a decline in backlog and delays and cancellations of client building projects 
the company has determined an interim review has not been necessary since the previous impairment review performed at march  as a result of the march  review  the company recorded  during the three months ended march   a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million and the company recognized a non cash income tax benefit of million  resulting in an after tax impairment charge of million 
the company s goodwill  amortizing and non amortizing intangible assets  and deferred tax liabilities associated with the design build and development segment have been reduced from the december  carrying amounts as a result of the impairment charge 
there were no subsequent interim reviews and there was no impairment charge recorded as part of the annual review as of december  see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
deterioration of market or economic conditions and volatility in the financial market has and could continue to influence future revenues  interest  and other costs  and could result in future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in june  the company issued million shares of common stock in a public offering  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
the net proceeds were used to fund a million repayment under the term loan  to reduce borrowings under the credit facility  and for working capital purposes 
as of december   the company owned and or managed medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities  totaling million net rentable square feet and serving hospital systems in states 
the company s portfolio consists of properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  each of which the company wholly owns or is a consolidated real estate partnership  three properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  in which the company owns a noncontrolling interest  properties  comprised of million net rentable square feet  that the company manages for third parties  and one property  comprised of  net rentable square feet  of which the company wholly owns  is actively being marketed for sale as of december   and is presented as discontinued operations in this annual report on form k 
as of december   of the company s wholly owned properties  were located on hospital campuses and an additional were located off campus  but were hospital anchored 
the company believes that its on campus and hospital anchored assets occupy a premier franchise location in relation to local hospitals  providing the company s properties with a distinct competitive advantage over alternative medical office space in an area 
as of december   the company s in service  consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties were approximately occupied  with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 
one wholly owned property was classified as held for sale in december and presented as discontinued operations for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report on form k 
the company completed the first fully integrated project with the completion of the woodlands center for specialized medicine during the fourth quarter of the company provided development  design build architectural  engineering and construction  and property management services for the medical office building and outpatient treatment center 
the company owns of the real estate partnership that owns the property and the real estate partnership is a consolidated partnership 
the company s capital projects team also completed alamance regional mebane outpatient center in and completed itscancer center expansion in the third quarter of the company has begun construction on four other on balance sheet investment projects with a total estimated investment of approximately million and holds a pipeline of planning and delivery projects throughout the country 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with gaap 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has provided a summary of the company s significant accounting policies in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those judged to involve accounting estimates or assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of such matters to change 
other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of the company s results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
acquisition of real estate the price that the company pays to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  the company is required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the company s estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to the company 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
the company s calculation methodology is summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on the company s results of operations because if the company were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if the company were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in the company s consolidated and combined statements of operations 
there were no acquisitions of real estate in acquisition of business the price that the company pays to acquire a business is impacted by many factors  including projected future cash flows  customer lists  contracts and proposals  trade names and trademarks  condition of property  plant  and equipment  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  the company is required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in business among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the company s estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of contacts  proposals  customer lists  workforce  trade names and trademarks  receivables  accruals and reserves  and property  plant  and equipment 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
the company s calculation methodology is summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on the company s results of operations because if the company were to allocate more value to goodwill or a non amortizing intangible asset there would be no amortization with respect to such amount or if the company were to allocate more value to a longer lived asset as opposed to allocating to shorter lived asset  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a longer period of time 
there were no acquisitions of businesses in useful lives of assets the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the company s properties and intangible assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record on an annual basis with respect to the company s assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income loss because if the company were to shorten the expected useful lives  then the company would depreciate or amortize such assets over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation or amortization expense on an annual basis 
asset impairment valuation the company reviews the carrying value of its properties  investments in real estate partnerships  and amortizing intangible assets annually and when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that a potential impairment may exist 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate or business investment s use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
these losses have a direct impact on the company s net income loss because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to operating results 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future sales  backlog  occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
because cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss for properties 
if the company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
the company reviews the value of goodwill using an income approach and market approach on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
the company s methodology to review goodwill impairment  which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates  provides a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred 
however  many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of the company s control and it is likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments which could be material 
the goodwill impairment review involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated by utilizing two approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach uses the reporting unit s projected operating results and discounted cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the cash flow projections use estimates of economic and market information over the projection period  including growth rates in revenues and costs and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and profitability characteristics 
additionally  the company reconciles the total of the estimated fair values of all its reporting units to its market capitalization to determine if the sum of the individual fair values is reasonable compared to the external market indicators 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  then an indication of impairment may exist and a second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill calculated in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  then an impairment charge for the difference would be recorded 
for non amortizing intangible assets  the company estimates fair value by applying an estimated market royalty rate to projected revenues and discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate and cause declines in the company s stock price  increases the estimated weighted average cost of capital  changes in cash flow multiples or projections  or changes in other inputs to goodwill assessment estimates  then a goodwill impairment review may be required prior to the company s next annual test 
it is reasonably possible that changes in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions  and estimates could cause the goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets to become impaired 
if goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets are impaired  the company would be required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse affect on its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to non cancelable operating leases is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the rental revenue that would be recognized under the cash flow received  based on the terms of the leases 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for all property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by the company 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
for design build contracts  the company recognizes revenue under the percentage of completion method 
due to the volume  varying complexity  and other factors related to the company s design build contracts  the estimates required to determine percentage of completion are complex and use subjective judgments 
changes in labor costs and material inputs can have a significant impact on the percentage of completion calculations 
the company has a long history of developing reasonable and dependable estimates related to design build contracts with clear requirements and rights of the parties to the contracts 
as long term design build projects extend over one or more years  revisions in cost and estimate earnings during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts which require the revision become known 
at the time a loss on a design build project becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the company receives fees for property management and development and consulting services from time to time from third parties which are reflected as fee revenue 
management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
revenue from development and consulting agreements is recognized as earned per the agreements 
due to the amount of control retained by the company  most joint venture developments will be consolidated  therefore  those development fees will be eliminated in consolidation 
other income shown in the statement of operations generally includes interest income  primarily from the amortization of unearned income on a sales type capital lease recognized in accordance with gaap  and other income incidental to the company s operations and is recognized when earned 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when the company s revenue is earned and the collectibility of the company s accounts receivable related to design build contracts and other sales  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant and customer concentrations  tenant and customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
reit qualification requirements the company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a reit 
if the company does not qualify as a reit  its income would become subject to us federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the company cannot re elect to qualify as a reit for four taxable years following the year it failed to quality as a reit 
the resulting adverse effects on the company s results of operations  liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be material 
changes in financial condition in june  the company issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to fund a million repayment under the term loan  to reduce borrowings under the company s credit facility  and for working capital purposes 
for more information on the credit facility and the term loan  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
assets decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to an after tax  goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of million 
see note within these consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company s income loss from operations is generated primarily from operations of its properties and design build services and to a lesser degree from consulting and property management agreements 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing property performance  changes in the number of properties due to development  acquisition  or disposition of properties  and the operating results of the design build and development segment 
for the year ended december   a significant proportion of the company s loss from operations is due to the million  net of tax  non cash impairment charge discussed previously in the overview section 
the company acquired mea  known then as marshall erdman associates  in march and results for the year ended december   reflect ten months of operating activity related to the subsidiary  reflecting operations from the acquisition date to december  for the year ended december   there are twelve months of operating activity related to the subsidiary 
business segments the company has two identified reportable segments property operations and design build and development 
the company defines business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided 
while the company operates as a single entity  it produces discrete financial information for each segment  which is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make resource allocation decisions and assess performance 
property operations includes real estate investment and rental activities as well as properly management for third parties 
design build and development includes design build construction activities as well as development and consulting activities 
for additional information  see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
property summary the following is an activity summary of the company s property portfolio excluding unconsolidated real estate partnerships for the years ended december  and for the year ended for the year ended december  december  properties at january acquisitions developments discontinued operations held for sale properties at december the above table includes east jefferson mri  which is accounted for as a sales type capital lease 
a property is considered in service upon the earlier of lease up and substantial completion of tenant improvements  or one year after cessation of major construction 
for portfolio and operational data  a single in service date is used 
for gaap reporting  a property is placed into service in stages as construction is completed and the property and tenant space is available for its intended use 
the company had zero properties in lease up at december year ended december  compared to year ended december  funds from operations modified ffom for the year ended december   ffom  excluding non recurring events  increased million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year 
property operations ffom  excluding non recurring events and intersegment eliminations  increased slightly from to however  design build and development ffom  excluding non recurring events and intersegment eliminations and net of taxes  decreased significantly from to the decrease in design build and development ffom was offset by a decrease in interest expense

for the year ended december   ffom  net of intersegment eliminations  attributable to property operations increased million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in rental revenue and property operating and management expenses is primarily due to the addition of the alamance regional mebane outpatient center property  which began operations in june rental revenue also increased due to rental rates associated with cpi increases and reimbursable expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease in occupancy from to the decrease in discontinued operations and impairment of real estate property  before real estate related depreciation and amortization  is due to the company recording a non cash impairment charge of million in order to reduce the carrying value of the harbison medical officer building formerly known as baptist northwest real estate property to its estimated net sale proceeds 
ffom attributable to design build and development  net of intersegment eliminations the design build and development segment includes mea  which the company acquired in march  and results for the years ended december  and  reflect twelve and ten months  respectively  of operating activity related to the subsidiary  reflecting operations from the acquisition date to december  the following is a summary of ffom attributable to design build and development  net of intersegment eliminations  for the years ended december  and in thousands for the year ended december  december  design build contract revenue and other sales  net of intersegment eliminations of  in and  in development management and other income  net of intersegment eliminations of  in and in design build contract and development management expenses  net of intersegment eliminations of  in and  in selling  general  and administrative expenses other income expense depreciation and amortization ffom  excluding impairment charge  net of intersegment eliminations impairment charge ffom  net of intersegment eliminations see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of above segment ffom to net income loss 
for the year ended december   ffom  excluding impairment charge  attributable to design build and development  net of intersegment eliminations  decreased million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year 
further  there were twelve months of activity in compared to ten months of activity in due to the acquisition of mea in march comparing full year ffom to full year ffom  there was a larger decrease in ffom due to a decrease in the volume of project activity 
revenues design build contract revenue and other sales plus development management and other income decreased million  or  from to this decrease is due to a lower volume of activity as the number of active revenue generating design build construction projects has decreased from at december  to at december  the decreased activity is due to the current economic environment  the volatility in the credit markets  and general uncertainty regarding government health care reform bills  which have resulted in clients delaying project starts and client project cancellations 
however  gross margin percentage revenues  as defined above  less design build contract and development management expenses and as a percent of revenues increased from in to in  or an increase of 
this increase is primarily due to cost controls implemented by the company and favorable pricing in the sub contracting market leading to lower overall costs 
development management and other income increased million  or  from to the increase is due to three active third party development engagements during compared to two engagements in one of the development engagements  which accounted for million of the increase  relates to the st 
luke s riverside engagement in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
this was a three building engagement project  of which the company was to wholly own or partially own one of the three buildings 
due to changes in the scope  size  and timing of the project  the company no longer intends to invest in the building under the original terms 
in accordance with the development agreement  the hospital system client paid for all reimbursable projects costs and for development services performed by the company 
selling  general  and administrative expenses attributable to the design build and development segment increased million  or  from to the increase is primarily due to a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  of which million related to one customer 
the increase is also due to two additional months of costs in as compared to because the mea acquisition occurred in march these increases were offset by fewer employees in as compared to due to reductions in force that occurred in december and may  a million expense in resulting from restructuring and severance charges  and a reduction of incentive compensation in due to the decreased profitability related to the business segment 
selling  general  and administrative for the year ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
excluding the increase attributable to the design build and development segment  which is discussed above  selling  general and administrative increased million due to several factors including non recurring costs for consultants  accountants  attorneys  and other service providers associated with the company s exploration of a range of strategic alternatives as well as increased costs associated with a branding marketing campaign 
these costs were offset by a reduction of incentive compensation due to decreased profitability 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in intangible amortization due to lower carrying values due to the impairment recorded in the first quarter of  as discussed below 
the decrease was also due to a decrease in the amortization of acquired in place lease intangible assets associated with properties acquired in as they have become fully amortized  offset by two additional months of expense in as compared to because the mea acquisition occurred in march impairment charge the company reviews the value of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
an interim review of the design build and development s intangible assets was performed as of march   due to a decline in the company s stock price  a decline in the cash flow multiples for comparable public engineering and construction companies  and changes in the cash flow projections for the design build and development business segment resulting from a decline in backlog and delays and cancellations of client building projects 
as a result of the march  review  the company recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million and the company recognized a non cash income tax benefit of million  resulting in an after tax impairment charge of million 
the company s goodwill  amortizing and non amortizing intangible assets  and deferred tax liabilities associated with the design build and development segment have been reduced from the december  carrying amounts as a result of the impairment charge 
there were no subsequent interim reviews and there was no impairment charge recorded as part of the annual review as of december  there was no such charge in the same period in the prior year 
gain on settlement from mea transaction during the year ended december   the final escrow release related to the mea transaction occurred 
pursuant to an agreement between the company and the mea seller representatives  million of the escrow was paid to the company in consideration of full and final settlement of certain claims made by the company in connection with the mea transaction 
the company recorded other income of million related to this settlement 
the company also received cash of million and op units valued at million were not issued

long term liquidity needs the company s principal long term liquidity needs consist primarily of new property development  property acquisitions  and principal payments under various mortgages and other credit facilities and non recurring capital expenditures 
the company does not expect that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet all of these long term liquidity needs 
instead  the company expects to finance new property developments through modest cash equity capital contributed by the company together with construction loan proceeds  as well as through cash equity investments by its tenants or third parties 
the company intends to have construction financing agreements in place before construction begins on development projects 
the company expects to fund property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under its credit facility and traditional secured mortgage financing 
in addition  the company may use op units issued by the operating partnership to acquire properties from existing owners seeking a tax deferred transaction 
although capital markets continued to remain restricted during and will likely remain restricted in  the company continues to expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through additional equity and debt financings  including loans from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other lending arrangements  most of which will be secured by mortgages 
notwithstanding the company s expectations discussed above  financial markets continue to experience unusual volatility and uncertainty 
financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks no longer willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers 
consequently  there is greater uncertainty regarding the company s ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or on any terms 
the company may also issue unsecured debt in the future 
however  with the current deteriorating general economic conditions and the current volatility of the debt and equity markets  there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to raise new debt or equity 
the company does not  in general  expect to meet its long term liquidity needs through dispositions of its properties 
in the event that the company were to sell any of its properties in the future  depending on which property were to be sold  the company may need to structure the sale or disposition as a tax deferred transaction which would require the reinvestment of the proceeds from such transaction in another property or  however  the proceeds that would be available to the company from such sales may be reduced by amounts that the company may owe under the tax protection agreements entered into in connection with the company s formation transactions and certain property acquisitions 
in addition  the company s ability to sell certain of its assets could be adversely affected by the general illiquidity of real estate assets and certain additional factors particular to the company s portfolio such as the specialized nature of its target property type  property use restrictions and the need to obtain consents or waivers of rights of first refusal or rights of first offers from ground lessors in the case of sales of its properties that are subject to ground leases 
the company intends to repay indebtedness incurred under its credit facility from time to time  for acquisitions or otherwise  out of cash flow from operations and from the proceeds  to the extent possible and desirable  of additional debt or equity issuances 
in the future  the company may seek to increase the amount of the credit facility  negotiate additional credit facilities or issue corporate debt instruments 
however  with the current volatility in the debt markets  there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to raise new debt 
any indebtedness incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  short  medium or long term  fixed or variable interest rate and may be subject to other terms and conditions the company deems acceptable 
the company intends to refinance at maturity the mortgage notes payable that have balloon payments at maturity

real estate taxes the company s leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for all real estate taxes 
inflation the company s leases at wholly owned and consolidated partnership properties generally provide for either indexed escalators  based on the cpi or other measures or  to a lesser extent  fixed increases in base rents 
the leases also contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
the company s property management and related services provided to third parties typically provide for fees based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
the revenues collected from leases are generally structured as described above  with year over year increases 
the company also pays certain payroll and related costs related to the operations of third party properties that are managed by the company 
under terms of the related management agreements  these costs are reimbursed by the third party property owners 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the contractual rent increases and tenant expense reimbursements described above 
seasonality business under the design build and development segment can be subject to seasonality due to weather conditions at construction sites 
in addition  construction starts and contract signings can be impacted by the timing of budget cycles at healthcare systems and providers

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates

of the company s total indebtedness  million  or  was subject to fixed interest rates  including variable rate debt that is subject to variable to fixed rate swap agreements 
the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was as of december  if libor were to increase by basis points  the increase in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  the company may take actions to further mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
