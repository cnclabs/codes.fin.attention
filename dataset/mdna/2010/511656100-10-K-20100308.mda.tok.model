item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lakeland financial corporation is the holding company for lake city bank 
the company is headquartered in warsaw  indiana and operates offices in twelve counties in northern indiana and a loan production office in indianapolis  indiana 
the company earned million for the year versus million for  a decrease of 
the decrease was driven primarily by an million increase in the provision for loan losses  a million increase in noninterest expense and a million decrease in noninterest income 
offsetting these negative impacts was a million increase in net interest income 
the company earned million for the year versus million for  an increase of 
the increase was driven primarily by an million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income 
offsetting these positive impacts was a million increase in the provision for loan losses and a million increase in noninterest expense 
basic earnings per share for the year was per share versus per share for and for diluted earnings per share for the year ended was per share versus per share for the year ended and for the year ended diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilutive impact of warrants and stock awards granted under employee equity incentive plans 
basic and diluted earnings per share for were also impacted by the company s issuance of million common shares during the year and the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
the company s total assets were billion as of december  versus billion as of december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in commercial loans from billion at december  to billion at december  results of operations versus the company reported net income of million in  a decrease of  or  versus net income of million in net interest income increased million  or  to million versus million in net interest income increased primarily due to the expansion of the net interest margin from in to in resulting from a large decrease in interest expense that offset an increase in interest income 
in addition  increases in average earning assets contributed to the increase in net interest income 
particularly a increase in commercial loans reflecting our continued strategic focus on commercial lending as a key driver of the business  contributed to the increase 

table of contents interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreases in the yield on average earning assets 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the company s daily cost of funds over the year due to a decrease in market rates over the same time period 
the company s net interest margin increased to in versus in  primarily due to declines in the company s daily cost of funds 
average earning assets increased by million from billion in to billion in as previously stated  an increase in commercial loans accounted for most of the increase 
additionally  most of the loan growth was attributed to significant growth in five counties st 
joseph  kosciusko  allen  hamilton and elkhart and with balanced growth in the bank s other regions 
the capital from the common stock offering and particularly the capital received from the tarp capital purchase program were used to fund the loan growth during in addition  deposits increased to fund the loan growth  driven primarily by increases of million in average certificates of deposit of  or more  million in interest bearing transaction accounts and million in other certificates of deposit 
the increase in interest bearing transaction accounts was driven primarily by the addition of a new product  which pays a higher interest rate on balances up to a maximum balance amount when certain conditions are met during each interest cycle 
management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio will likely continue in a measured  but prudent  fashion as a result of our strategic focus on commercial lending and in conjunction with the general expansion and penetration of the geographical markets the company serves  as well as our expansion in the indianapolis market and the continued progress that we are making in that relatively new market 
interest income was also affected by an increase in nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of there were relationships totaling million classified as impaired as of december  versus relationships totaling million at the end of the increase in nonaccrual loans resulted primarily from the addition of three commercial relationships totaling million 
the increase in impaired loans resulted from the three commercial relationships mentioned previously  as well as one other commercial relationship of million 
net charge offs were million in versus million in  representing and of average daily loans in and total nonperforming loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of the provision for loan loss expense was million in  resulting in an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  which represented of the loan portfolio  versus a provision for loan loss expense of million in and an allowance for loan losses of million at the end of  or of the loan portfolio 
the higher provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors  but was primarily a result of an increase in net charge offs  general growth in the loan portfolio  as well as higher allocations on specific watch list credits 
the level of loan loss provision was also influenced by other factors related to the growth in the loan portfolio  such as the continued emerging market risk  the continued emerging concentration risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss percentages 
in addition  management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans 
noninterest income was million in versus million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was driven in a large part  by a change related to the processing of merchant credit card activities 
prior to the third quarter of  transaction driven revenue and expenses related to this category were reported on a gross basis in merchant card fee income in noninterest income and credit card interchange fees in noninterest expense 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company began converting clients to a new third party processor for this activity 
as a result  only net revenues with the new processor are being recognized in merchant card fee income in noninterest income 
this change was driven by the structure of the agreement with the third party processor  and not due to any change in the company s accounting policies 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or  also affecting noninterest income 
the decrease was due primarily to decreases in retail nsf and overdraft fees as we believe retail customers have been spending less because of the general economic environment 
mortgage banking income increased by million  or  offsetting some of the decreases in noninterest income 
the increase was driven by lower mortgage interest rates  which has led to increased loan refinance volumes as well as a larger pipeline of mortgage loan applications 
loan  insurance and service fees also increased  or  driven by higher fee income on increased debit card activity generated by requirements under a rewards checking program 
additionally  noninterest income in was positively impacted due to a nonrecurring gain of  related to the visa initial public offering and the redemption of some of the shares we owned in connection with the offering 

table of contents noninterest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in other expense increased by million  or  driven by higher fdic insurance premiums 
fdic premiums increased by million in versus we expect our premiums to continue to increase as we increase our deposit base and as the fdic continues to charge all insured institutions higher assessments due to the current troubled economy 
salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or 
the increase was driven by staff additions primarily in revenue producing areas as well as normal salary increases  increased health insurance and performance based incentive expense 
credit card interchange fees decreased due to the agreement with the third party processor which resulted in reporting revenues and expenses on a net basis 
as a result of these factors  income before income tax expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in income tax expense was million in versus million in income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in both and net income decreased  or  to million in versus million in basic earnings per share in was  a decrease of  versus in earnings per share in were impacted by the company s issuance of an additional million shares of common stock  as well as million in dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock related to the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program

interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the company s daily cost of funds over the year due to a decrease in market rates over the same time period 
the company had a net interest margin of in versus in  primarily due to a decline in the prime rate from to during  which was led by changes in the fed fund rate by the federal open market committee 
average earning assets increased by million from billion in to billion in this increase was due primarily to loan growth led by significant growth in five counties st 
joseph  kosciusko  allen  hamilton and elkhart and with balanced growth in the bank s other regions 
deposits increased to fund the loan growth during  driven primarily by increases of million in interest bearing transaction accounts  million in average brokered deposit balances and million in average other time deposit account balances 
the increase in interest bearing transaction accounts was driven primarily by the addition of a new product  which paid a higher interest rate on balances up to a maximum balance amount when certain conditions were met during each interest cycle 
in addition  loan growth was funded by a million increase in the average balance in federal home loan bank advances 
nonaccrual loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of there were relationships totaling million classified as impaired as of december  versus five relationships totaling million at the end of the increase in impaired and nonperforming loans resulted primarily from the addition of four commercial relationships totaling million

management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 

table of contents noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven by a million  or  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase was due primarily to increases in retail nsf fees and account analysis service charges on commercial checking accounts  which are generally higher when the earnings allowance credit rate is lower 
additionally  noninterest income increased due to a nonrecurring gain of  related to the visa initial public offering and the redemption of some of the shares we owned in connection with the offering 
investment brokerage fees increased  or  due to increased trade volume 
loan  insurance and service fees increased  or  driven by higher fee income on debit card activity 
noninterest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in other expense increased by million  or  driven by regulatory expenses which increased by million due to the company s resumption of regular fdic insurance premiums  as prior credits expired early in salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or  driven by normal salary increases  increased health insurance and performance based incentive expense  the addition of revenue producing staff and enhanced staff in administrative positions 
data processing fees and supplies increased  or  driven by the implementation of a new corporate treasury management platform and contractual increases in existing operating services 
net occupancy expense increased by  or  primarily as a result of higher maintenance and repair costs and higher property tax expense that resulted from the indiana property tax reapportionment process 
as a result of these factors  income before income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in income tax expense was million in versus million in income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in versus in the increase in the tax rate was driven by a lower percentage of revenue being derived from tax advantaged sources in versus net income increased  or  to million in versus million in basic earnings per share in was  an increase of  versus in the company s net income performance represented a return on january   stockholders equity versus in the net income performance resulted in a return on average daily assets in versus in financial condition as of december   the company had branches serving twelve counties in northern indiana and one loan production office in indianapolis 
since  the company has added seventeen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities  including fdic assisted transactions  with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of client focused  independent banking  as well as increased penetration in existing markets where opportunities for market share growth exist 
total assets of the company were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  when compared to billion as of december  total cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  total securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the portfolio contained mostly collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities which were either directly or indirectly backed by the federal government or a local municipal government and collateralized mortgage obligations rated aaa by s p or aaa by moody s at the time of purchase 
as of december   the company had million of collateralized mortgage obligations which were not issued by the federal government or government sponsored agencies  but were rated aaa by s p and or aaa by moody s at the time of purchase 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  the increase in securities available for sale was a result of a number of activities in the securities portfolio 
paydowns from prepayments of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was  maturities and calls of securities totaled million 
these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million 
the fair value of the securities increased million due to higher market values for securities which were backed directly or indirectly by the federal government 
the investment portfolio is managed to provide for an appropriate balance between credit risk and investment return and to limit the company s exposure to risk to an acceptable level 
six of the private label collateralized mortgage obligations in the investment portfolio were still rated aaa aaa as of december   but eighteen had been downgraded by s p  fitch and or moody s  including sixteen which were ranked below investment grade by one or more rating agencies 
the company independently  analyzed valuations for these securities that include projections of future performance in the underlying collateral using various scenarios and prepayment assumptions 
the company used bloomberg analytics and other third party assistance in preparing this analysis 
based on the analyses as of december   the company realized 
table of contents  in other than temporary impairment  equal to expected credit losses  on three of the private label collateralized mortgage obligations 
real estate mortgages held for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from  at december  the balance of this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market 
the company generally sells to third parties almost all of the mortgage loans it originates 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to million and million in total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
this general increase in commercial loans was a result of the company s long standing strategic focus toward emphasizing origination of commercial loans 
the portfolio breakdown at year end and reflected commercial and industrial and agri business  residential real estate and home equity and consumer loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable incurred credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following considerations 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses from a wide variety of industries 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk than other types of loans 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  if economic conditions do not stabilize or improve  certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the principal is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation  as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
an appropriate level of general allowance is determined after considering the following factors application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentrations  new industry lending activity and current economic conditions 
federal regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets on a regular basis 
the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard  doubtful or loss  but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish specific allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  the company had loans totaling million on the classified loan list versus million on december  as of december   the company had million of assets classified special mention  million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and classified as loss as compared to million  million  million and at december  in addition  at december  the company had two relationships accounted for as troubled debt restructurings a  mortgage loan with an allocation of  and a million commercial credit with an allocation of million 
the company has no commitments to lend additional funds to either of the borrowers 
there were no troubled debt restructurings at december  allowance estimates are developed by management taking into account actual loss experience  adjusted for current economic conditions 
the company discusses this methodology with regulatory authorities to ensure 
table of contents compliance 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the company s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
for a more thorough discussion of the allowance for loan losses methodology see the critical accounting policies section of this item the allowance for loan losses increased or million  from million december  to million at december  pooled loan allocations increased million from million at december  to million at december   which was a result of an increase in pooled loan balances of million year over year and an increase in loan allocations due to increased historical charge offs and the current economic environment 
specific loan allocations increased million from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the higher classified loan balance 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to the uncertainty in the current economic conditions 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio while the percentage of commercial loans to all loans has remained relatively constant at  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management has historically considered growth and portfolio composition when determining loan loss allocations 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to the loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans increased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled  versus  at december  for december  and  million and million of impaired loans were also included in the total for nonaccrual loans 
total impaired loans increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans resulted primarily from the addition of three commercial relationships totaling million 
as discussed earlier 
the increase in impaired loans resulted primarily from the three commercial relationships mentioned previously  as well as one other commercial relationship of million 
the company allocated million and million of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans percentage was in and in the company s total nonperforming loans were of total loans at year end versus of total loans at the end of however  the company s overall asset quality position can be influenced by a small number of credits due to the focus on commercial lending activity 
management does not foresee a rapid recovery from the current distressed economic conditions in the company s markets as certain industries  including residential and commercial real estate development  recreational vehicle and mobile home manufacturing and other regional industries continue to experience general slow downs and shrinkage from their levels a few years ago 
the company s continued growth strategy promotes diversification among industries as well as continued focus on enforcement of a strong credit environment and an aggressive position in loan work out situations 
while the company believes that the impact of these industry specific issues will be somewhat mitigated by its overall expansion strategy  the economic recession impacting its entire geographic footprint will continue to present challenges 
total deposits decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease resulted from decreases of million in brokered deposits  million in public fund certificates of deposit  million in other certificates of deposit and million in interest bearing transaction accounts 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in certificates of deposit of  and over  million in money market accounts  million in cdars certificates of deposit  
table of contents million in savings deposits and million in demand deposits 
growth in savings and retail transaction accounts was driven by an existing rewards checking product and the introduction of a rewards savings product 
management intends to continue to promote these as premier banking products and expects growth to continue in these products 
total short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from million in borrowings under the federal reserve bank s term auction facility and an million increase in short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the increases were offset by decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million and million in federal funds purchased 
the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by current accounting guidance afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
to further strengthen the company s capital position  the company issued million additional common shares resulting in net proceeds to the company of million in november in addition  on february   the company participated in treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
pursuant to the program  the company issued to treasury  shares of the series a preferred stock 
the million received by the company in connection with this investment qualifies as tier regulatory capital for the company 
in conjunction with this issuance of preferred stock  the company issued a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the warrant has subsequently been adjusted to  shares as a result of the successful common equity offering 
the ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  positive pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   for net treasury stock sold   related to stock option exercises   in stock compensation expense   in stock award exercise expense  million from the issuance of preferred stock  net of accretion  and million from the issuance of common stock 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  an unfavorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  negative pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   for the acquisition of treasury stock  and million related to stock option exercises 
the afs adjustment was primarily related to a basis point increase in the two to five year us treasury rates during management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to help ensure that stockholders equity will be adequate under various scenarios 

table of contents critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principle is uncollectable 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans  although the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged against the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is taken based on management s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance 
a formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted at least monthly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio  emerging market risk  emerging concentration risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss analysis 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
furthermore  management s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision 
the determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
consideration is not limited to these factors  although they represent the most commonly cited factors 
with respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits  management generally considers the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and the valuation of collateral as the primary measures 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits 
with respect to pools of similar loans  we generally use percentage allocations based upon historical analysis 
we may also adjust these allocations for other factors cited above 
an appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined after considering the following application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity and general economic conditions 
it is also possible that the following could affect the overall process social  political  economic and terrorist events or activities 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
as a result of this detailed process  the allowance results in two forms of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration and internal loan review functions 
a credit grade is assigned to each commercial loan by both the commercial loan officer and the loan review department 
these grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a loan may or may not be graded the same 
the grade given by the loan review department is assigned in the company s loan system for individual credits 
the need for specific allocation of the loan loss reserve is considered for individual credits when graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
other considerations with respect to specific allocations for individual credits include  but are not limited to  the following a does the customer s cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan  b is there adequate collateral to repay the loan  c has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination  d is the loan on non accrual  e are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question  or f are there unique loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicate the loan is impaired 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
in addition  general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans 
these general pooled loan 
table of contents allocations are performed for similar portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as the level of classified credits  economic uncertainties  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the company s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the company adopted the current accounting guidance on january   and for sales of mortgage loans beginning in  mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recognized as assets for the full fair value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
subsequent measurement uses the amortization method where all servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and interest rate 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
the servicing assets had a fair value of million at both december  and at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of mortgage servicing rights to an immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows dollars in thousands fair value of mortgage servicing assets constant prepayment speed psa impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should not be relied upon 
as the figures indicate  changes in value based on a and variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the servicing asset is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
on a monthly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and interest rate 
if impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a 
table of contents portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
valuation and other than temporary impairment of investment securities the fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing  which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities 
different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value 
at the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other than temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance 
an impairment is other than temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received 
significant judgments are required in determining impairment  which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments  loss assumptions and the change in interest rates 
we consider the following factors when determining an other than temporary impairment for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future  and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
for the private label mortgage backed securities  additional independent analysis is performed to determine if other than temporary impairment needs to be recorded for these securities 
the independent analysis utilizes third party reports which include projections of the cash flows of the individual securities under several different scenarios based upon assumptions as to collateral defaults  prepayment speeds  expected losses and the severity of potential losses 
based upon the initial review using the third party reports  securities may be identified for further analysis 
if any are identified  management makes assumptions as to prepayment speeds  default rates  severity of losses and lag time until losses are actually recorded for each security based upon historical data for each security and other factors 
cash flows for each security using these assumptions are generated and the net present value is computed using an appropriate discount rate the current accounting yield for the individual security 
the net present value is then compared to the book value of the security to determine if there is any other than temporary impairment that must be recorded 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security will be written down to the then current fair value  and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of other than temporary impairment 
in addition  discount accretion will be discontinued on any bond that meets one or both of the following the rating by s p  moody s or fitch decreases to below a and or the cash flow analysis on a security indicates under any scenario modeled by the third party there is a potential to not receive the full amount invested in the security

liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions as of the filing date of this form k  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal funds lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company had all of its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio at december  therefore  the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold the majority of its originated mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
as a result of the unprecedented activity in the financial markets during the third and fourth quarters of which continued throughout  the company has reviewed its liquidity plan and has taken several actions designed to provide for an appropriate funding strategy in this unsettled environment 
these actions include actively communicating with correspondent banks who provide federal fund lines to ensure availability of these funds  expanded use of brokered certificate of deposits  which have been readily available to the company at competitive rates  allocation of collateral at the federal reserve bank for borrowings under their programs  increased usage of fhlb advances at advantageous rates and an increased focus on attractive core deposit programs

these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and open ended revolving lines of credit 
the company follows the same credit policy including requiring collateral  if deemed appropriate to make such commitments as is followed for those loans that are recorded in its financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance is represented by the contractual amount of the commitments 
management does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments 
off balance sheet transactions are more fully discussed in note 
table of contents inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any significant derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest bearing assets on december   the net interest margin could be expected to decline in both a falling interest rate environment and in a rising rate environment 
during the fomc kept the target federal funds rate at a range of to 
and indicated they expect to keep the rate at that level for an extended period of time 
due to the low rate environment there was a reduction in the company s yield on earning assets of 
this decrease in the yield on earning assets was offset by a decrease in the rates paid on deposit accounts and purchased funds 
the rate paid on deposit accounts and purchased funds decreased for the combined result of the decreases in the yield on earning assets and in the rates paid on deposits and purchased funds was an increase in the net margin from for to for future changes in the net interest margin will be dependent upon multiple factors including further actions by the fomc during in response to economic conditions  competitive pressures in the various markets served  and changes in the structure of the balance sheet as a result of changes in customer demands for products and services 
the company utilizes a computer modeling software to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements 
although management does not consider gap ratios in this planning  the information can be used in a general fashion to look at asset and liability mismatches 
the company s cumulative repricing gap ratio as of december  for the next months using a rates unchanged scenario was a negative of earning assets
