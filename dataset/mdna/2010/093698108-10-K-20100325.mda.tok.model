part i item business introduction overview blonder tongue is a technology development and manufacturing company that delivers encoding  digital transport  and broadband product solutions to the cable markets the company serves  including the multi dwelling unit market  the lodging hospitality market and the institutional market  including hospitals  prisons and schools 
from the cable television pioneers that founded the company in  to the highly experienced research and development team that creates new products today  the company s success stems from working with its customers to provide quality products and support 
for years blonder tongue has been providing real world solutions based on continually advancing technology  enabling the company to maintain its position as a leader in the cable markets it serves 
since its fo unding  blonder tongue has developed technology for niche cable television applications 
with the expansion into high quality high definition hd digital encoding  internet protocol television iptv and most recently edge qam quadrature amplitude modulation  the company is positioned to grow its existing business and continue expanding into new markets 
the cable market has reacted quickly to consumer demands for additional services by integrating multiple technologies into its existing networks to provide consumers high speed data and telephony in addition to video offerings 
today  video offerings have expanded from traditional cable television service to internet protocol ip based video delivery  switched digital video  video on demand  scheduled playback and video storage 
telephone companies have increased their market share in this competitive environment with fiber to the home ftth distribution networks  enabling them to provide traditional cable television  expanded video services and high speed data service s  in addition to telephony offerings 
as a result of these market demands  the lodging and institutional markets continue to upgrade their networks to carry hd channels in order to meet consumers expectations 
this is a significant area of opportunity for the company to market and sell its expanded digital product line 
in  the company took advantage of the federal communications commission s fcc mandated transition from analog to digital broadcasts 
the results in were favorable  as reflected by increased sales of digital transition products 
in early  the fcc extended the digital transition date by months giving customers additional time to make the upgrade to digital 
the company anticipated that it would derive additional business from this extension  but found that most of its customers had been prepared for the earlier date 
the sale of transitional products  products that convert digital to analog  had peaked in customers were now looking towards long term digital product solutions 
the company moved on from its transitional products and continued with its long term product strategy to fill this need 
most of the changes in the market segments that the company serves have recently been centered on the transition to digital technologies  not only in broadcast  but throughout video and broadband transport 
the company identified three significant opportunities in the digital space  encoding  iptv and edge qam 
encoding enables operators to provide standard definition sd or hd content delivery so that those services can be transported over a broadband network 
iptv enables operators to stream video over private data networks with greater dependability and content security 
while already experiencing full scale commercialization in international markets  the united states market is now embracing iptv technology 
the worldwide m arket projections reveal an estimated million subscribers for iptv services by service providers transport both sd and hd video content in mpeg formats over ip networks to network edge devices located in high density serving areas 
the edge device  commonly referred to as edgeqam  allows the conversion from ip to radio frequency rf via qam modulation close to the customer location 
these signals are then transported to the customer using a combination of fiber  hybrid fiber coax and coax systems 
management of the company estimates the market for edgeqam devices to be about million over the next three years 
in the company began marketing and selling iptv products  in shipped its first high quality hd encoder and in began shipping its high quality affordably priced edgeqam product 
the company continues to develop new versions of these products to meet the needs of customers i n the markets that it serves 
recent developments in recent years  the company has continued to advance the implementation of its strategic plan in an effort to maximize shareholder value 
the company s strategic plan consists of the following strengthening its core business  continuing its heritage of technology development  expanding into new markets  enhancing its leadership structure  and increasing gross margins 
in april  the company made the decision to cease operations of its wholly owned subsidiary  hybrid networks  llc hybrid  and to liquidate its assets 
hybrid operated video  high speed data and or telephony systems at four multi unit dwelling communities 
the discontinuation of hybrid s operations is the final step in the company s exit from active operation and management of private cable  data and telephony systems  which the company considers a non core business activity 
based on this decision  in the company recognized a net loss on disposal of approximately  related to the hybrid fixed assets 
during  the company entered into various standard agreements to obtain use of technologies for its new digital encoder line of products 
the first  an implementation and system license agreement with dolby laboratories licensing corporation for dolby digital plus professional encoder  and channel licensed technology  grants the company the right to manufacture  label and sell professional digital encoder products and consumer digital decoder products and to use the dolby trademarks 
this technology was developed specifically for the introduction of hd dvd and blu ray disc and has a number of improvements aimed at increasing quality at a given bit rate compared with legacy dolby digital ac 
most notably  it offers increased bit rates up to mbit s  support for more audio chann els up to  improved coding techniques to reduce compression artifacts  and backward compatibility with existing ac hardware 
in july  the company entered into a license agreement with digital content protection  llc  to become a full adopter of hdcp high bandwidth digital content protection license technology  which agreement allows the company to manufacture hdcp components and products  as well as purchase the hdcp device key sets necessary for manufacturing such products 
hdcp  a specification developed by intel corporation and licensed to digital content protection  llc  prevents copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across  among other connections  high definition multimedia interface hdmi  even if such copying would be permitted by fair use laws 
the specification is proprietary  and requires a license f rom digital content protection for implementation 
the company s revenues to date related to use of this license have not been material 
in may  the company entered into a license agreement with digital transmission licensing administrator  llc dtla to become a full adopter of dtcp digital transmission content protection license technology which aims at encrypting interconnections between devices  such as personal computers or portable media players 
in theory this allows content to be distributed through these other devices  if they also implement the dtcp standards 
dtcp was created jointly by hitachi  intel  matsushita  sony  and toshiba  and is licensed to content providers  electronics manufacturers  and broadcast service providers through dtla 
dtcp specification is proprietary and is only disseminated to members who have entered into agreements with dtla 
the company s revenues to date related to use of this license have not been material 
the company entered into a non exclusive license agreement with zenith electronics  llc now lg electronics as a pro idiom content protection system manufacturer 
the pro idiom digital technology platform was developed by lg electronics  a major supplier of flat panel displays  to provide the hospitality market with a robust  secure digital rights management drm system 
drm ensures rapid  broad deployment of hd television hdtv and other high value digital content to licensed users in the hotel industry 
lodging industry leaders such as lodgenet entertainment corporation and others have licensed the pro idiom drm system 
a growing number of content providers have demonstrated their acceptance of pro idiom by licensing their hd content for delivery to the pro idiom users 
the company s revenues to date related to use of this license have not been material 
in may  the company obtained ownership from the motion picture experts group of an mpeg profile high level video encoder ip core 
this is a unique compression engine capable of creating hd mpeg ip real time encoding of a single channel of i p i video 
the use of this real time encoding technique enables the company to provide broadcast mpeg hd and sd encoding 
mpeg is widely used as the format of digital television signals that are broadcast by terrestrial over the air  cable  and direct broadcast satellite tv systems 
it also specifies the format of movies and other programs that are distributed on dvd and similar discs 
in the company began an initiative to reduce manufacturing costs in order to obtain a competitive advantage in the markets served and facilitate aggressive marketing programs 
this initiative began with the transfer of manufacturing of certain products to the people s republic of china prc  and the implementation of initiatives to decrease material and labor costs in products manufactured in new jersey 
since then  the company s prc initiative has continued with the transfer of manufacturing for certain high volume  labor intensive products to the prc  including many of the company s analog products 
the company anticipates that proprietary products and those requiring less labor will continue to be manu factured at the new jersey facility  including most of the company s digital products 
the company s manufacturing initiative entails a combination of contract manufacturing agreements and purchase agreements with key prc manufacturers that can most fully meet the company s needs 
the company has a manufacturing agreement with a key contract manufacturer in the prc that governs the terms of its manufacture of certain of the company products upon a purchase order being submitted by the company 
the company expects to continue to implement this ongoing transition in phases over the next several years  with the goal that it will ultimately encompass products representing a significant amount but less than a majority of the company s net sales 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to provide manufacturing  research and development and product support to buffalo city center leasing  llc buffalo city for an electronic on board recorder that buffalo city is producing for turnpike global technologies  llc 
the three year agreement is anticipated to provide up to  in revenue to the company 
the company received  and  in revenue from buffalo city in and  respectively 
a director of the company is also the managing member and vice president of buffalo city and may be deemed to control the entity which owns fifty percent of the membership interests of buffalo city 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in november and completed its initial public offering in december strategy it is a constant challenge for the company to stay at the forefront of the technological requirements of the markets that it serves  including the mdu  lodging and institutional markets 
changes and developments in the manner in which information whether video  voice or data is transmitted as well as the use of alternative compression technologies  all require the company to continue to develop innovative new products 
the company continually adds the resources needed to create innovative products to respond to the demand for digital signal generation and transmission 
the company s key product lines are more thoroughly discussed under products beginning on page the ongoing evolution of the company s product lines focuses on the increased needs created in the digital space by iptv  digital video and hdtv signals and the transport of these signals over state of the art broadband networks 
in response to the market pressure to compete with far east manufactured products and to expand its market coverage outside north america  in the company entered into an arrangement with a major contract manufacturer in the prc to manufacture certain of its high volume  labor intensive products 
the initiative has continued and will be ongoing as products merit consideration  in conjunction with the company s domestic manufacturing 
the company s principal end use customers are tv broadcasters cable system operators both franchise and private  as well as cable contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build  lodging hospitality video and high speed data system operators that specialize in the lodging hospitality markets  and institutional system operators that operate  upgrade and maintain the systems that are in their facilities  or contractors that install  upgrade and maintain these systems in a variety of applications including schools  universities  hospitals  prisons  corporations  enterprises  sports stadiums and airports 
a key component of the company s growth strategy is to leverage its reputation across a broad product line  offering one stop shop convenience to the cable  broadcast  and professional markets and delivering products having a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a leading position in the niche cable markets that it serves 
the company provides integrated network solutions for operators in the multi dwelling unit market  the lodging hospitality market and the institutional market 
markets overview the broadband signal distribution industry involving the high speed transmission of television  telephony and internet signals has been dominated by franchise cable television and multiple system cable operators msos 
the penetration of wireless  direct broadcast satellite dbs  such as directv and dish network  in the tv market continues to grow with a combined subscriber count in excess of million 
telephone companies ie verizon and at t also compete with the mso s for high speed data services and continue to expand their fiber optic networks  on a national level  delivering video  high speed data and telephony services di rect to the home or to the curb 
the msos continue to deploy mpeg ip transport to the edge of their networks via fiber optic networks and convert those ip streams to rf channels so they can continue to provide conventional video services over existing two way coax networks 
their plans are to expand the reach of fiber optic networks to take fiber closer to the customer and to the user 
the long term result of these activities is increased competition for the provision of services and a trend toward delivery of these services through fiber using ip technology 
this major market transition has resulted in increased consumer expectations  placing the lodging and institutional markets under pressure to install new infrastructure and upgrade existing networks 
it is not known how long this transition will take but to remain competitive  the company must continue to increase its product offerings for fiber transmission  digital television  encoding and decoding and digital applications 
cable television most cable television operators  both large and small  have built fiber optic networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coaxial cable to deliver television signal programming  data and phone services on one drop cable 
cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in nearly all existing systems 
the system architecture employed to provide analog video  digital video  hdtv  high speed data  vod and telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial hfc network 
in an hfc network  fiber optic trunk lines connect to nodes which typically feed to subscribers  using coaxial cable 
with the proposed adoption of new standards by cablelabs  the cable industry is using edge devices to increase services from each node and to increase the number of subscribers that a node can serve 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting homes and multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of our digital video headend products including  encoders  edgeqam and digital video solutions 
lodging competition among cable operators serving the lodging market to provide more channels especially in hd  vod and enhanced interactivity  has resulted in increased demand for analog  digital and hd television system electronics 
these systems have been and continue to be well received in the market  as property owners have sought additional revenue streams and guests have demanded increased in room technology services 
the leading system integrators in this market rely upon outside suppliers for their system electronics and most are blonder tongue customers 
these companies offer the guests of lodging establishments more free channels as well as vod for a broad selection of movie titles  and interactive services 
most of the systems with vod services or hd channels were initially in large hotels  where the economics of high end systems are more easily justified 
smaller hotels and motels are now being outfitted with enhanced technology  specifically edgeqam  to provide a full suite of hd channels 
the demand for hd and competition are keeping the market growth reasonably steady 
institutional the company identifies the institutional market as education campus environments  correctional facilities  short or long term health service environments  sports stadiums and airport terminals 
what all of these seemingly unrelated facilities have in common is that they all contain private networks that are dependant on either locally generated or externally sourced video and or data content 
as the advanced technologies of distance learning  hdtv and iptv permeate the market  institutional facilities are embracing these technologies to achieve site specific goals 
the company has traditionally benefited from a very strong share of this market with its analog video headend and distribution products 
we anticipate that this trend will continue and evolve into firm adoption of our digita l video headend products  which include hd encoders  edgeqam  digital video solutions and our evolving iptv platforms 
the company developed a distance learning system classroomedge  or cre as an affordable easy to operate system for the education market 
this product line provides two way transport of stored video content over either fiber or coax based rf broadband networks or local area network data systems 
in  the company continued marketing the product and educating specifiers architects  engineers and consultants regarding the features and benefits of the system seeking to take advantage of its brand recognition and educational market penetration 
the company recently received commitments for the delivery of the first deployments of these systems 
international the company has authorized distributors and sales agents throughout the world  but the company primarily manufactures product for sale in the usa 
international sales do not materially contribute to the company s revenue base 
additional considerations the technological revolution with respect to video  data and voice services continues at a rapid pace 
cable tv s qam video is competing with directv and echostar s dbs service and cable modems compete with digital subscriber lines and ftth offered by the regional telephone companies 
the phone companies are building national fiber networks and are now delivering video  data and voice services directly to the home over fiber optic cable  and voice over ip voip is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies 
the convergence of data and video communications continues  wherein computer and television systems merge 
while it is not possible to predict wi th certainty which technology will be dominant at any particular point in time  the company believes that delivery of services using ip and switched digital video technology will eventually dominate the delivery systems of the future and the tremendous bandwidth available through the use of fiber optic cable will eventually be the dominant carrier of video  voice and data communications signals 
since the installed base of united states television sets are for the most part analog not digital  direct satellite television  digitally compressed programming and ip delivery require headend products or set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the transmitted signals back to analog 
the replacement of all television sets with digital sets will be costly and take many years to complete 
the majority of service providers continue to deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
some operators are simulcasting both analog and digital services and charging customers additionally for the use of high definition digital s et top boxes 
key products blonder tongue s products can be separated according to function and technology 
four key categories account for the majority of the company s revenue analog video headend  digital transition headend products  digital video headend  and distribution analog video headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation to create an analog channel lineup for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are satellite receivers  integrated receiver decoders  demodulators  modulators  antennas and antenna mounts  amplifiers  equalizers and processors 
the headend is the brain of an analog television signal distribution system 
it is the central location where multiple channels are initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for analog distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encry pted form or digitized and compressed  a receiver will also be required to decode the signal 
even though these products are mature  blonder tongue continues to develop products to maintain market share 
for example  in several new analog products were launched in response to the calm act 
the commercial advertisement loudness mitigation act calm  hr introduced in congress will require the federal communications commission to preclude commercials from being broadcast at louder volumes than the program material they accompany 
this bill addresses a widespread consumer complaint about the abrupt loudness of television advertisements 
this would ensure that the volume levels of commercial breaks are consistent with the volume level of the programming which it brackets 
the company estimates that analog video headend products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
digital transition headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation to create an analog channel lineup for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are demodulators  modulators and processors 
these products are used in applications where service providers receive local off air digital broadcast channels and or digital channels from cable operators and have a need to continue to provide an analog broadcast tier  or in the case of schools and hospitals where there is a large installed base of analog television sets  making it cost prohibitive to replace large numbers of sets 
use of these products allows service provide rs to defer or phase in over a period of time the switch to all digital as capital is available and the cost of digital television sets decline 
the aqd series allows for the reception and demodulation of qam digital  off air standard digital or off air hdtv signals 
this enables system operators in all of the company s primary markets to benefit from digital transmission  while preserving their analog distribution networks and viewing sites long after the fcc mandatory transition 
the company estimates that digital transition headend products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and respectively 
digital video headend products used by a system operator for acquisition  processing and manipulation of digital video signals 
blonder tongue continues to expand its digital product offerings to meet the changing needs of its customers 
the latest additions include the edgeqam collection and the hde encoder collection which includes a line of hd and sd mpeg encoders and multiplexers 
among the other digital products provided by blonder tongue are the qtm line of transcoders  digital quadrature amplitude modulation qam up converters and multiplexers and digital vsb qam hd television processors for delivery of hdtv programmin g and agile qam modulators 
encoders accept and auto detect various inputs sources analog and or digital and output digitally encoded hd or sd video in various output formats such as an asynchronous serial interface asi signal or a modulated qam signal 
the qam outputs may be used for digital video distribution over typical private coaxial networks in a variety of institutional environments ie sports arenas  broadcast and cable television studios  airports  hospitals  university campuses  etc asi is a streaming data format which carries the mpeg transport stream 
as a complement to the encoder line  blonder tongue also provides a digital qam multiplexer which takes up to four inputs asi or vsb qam and delivers a single multiplexed qam output thereby optimizing the hd channel line up by preserving bandwidth 
edgeqam devices accept ethernet input and capture mpeg over ip transport streams  decrypt service provider conditional access or content protection  provide hd or sd encoding and can insert proprietary conditional access such as pro idiom into the stream 
these streams are then combined and modulated on to qam rf carriers in some cases providing multiple streams on to one mhz digital channel 
inputs to edgeqam devices can come from satellite receivers  set top boxes  network devices or video servers 
the use of these devices add flexibility for the service provider  in part  because all of this routing happens in one device 
scaling is accomplished via software and modules embedded inside the hardware 
since it is a true network device  the edgeqam can be managed over a traditional ethernet network or over the internet 
the qtm line is used for economically deploying or adding a satellite based digital programming tier of digital or hdtv digital programming 
the unit transcodes a satellite signal s modulation from quadrature phase shift key qpsk to qam or from psk hdtv format to qam 
since qpsk and psk are optimum for satellite transmission and qam is optimum for fiber coaxial distribution  precious system bandwidth is saved while the signal retains its digital information 
building upon the innovative design work that brought about the qtm transcoders  qam up converters and hdtv processors  the company launched the aqd series of atsc qam demodulators 
digital video headend product use continues to expand in all of the company  s primary markets  bringing more advanced technology to consumers and operators  and it is expected that this area will continue to grow to become a major element of the company s business 
the company estimates that digital video headend products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
distribution products used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber optic or coaxial cable 
among the products offered by the company in this category are line extenders  broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall taps 
in cable television systems  the distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coaxial cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
the company estimates that distribution products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
other products 
there are a variety of other products that the company sells to a lesser degree either to fill a customer need or where sales have reduced due to changes in company direction  technology  or market influences 
these include fiber products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber optic cable 
among the products offered are optical transmitters  receivers  couplers and splitters 
these products convert rf frequencies to light or infrared frequencies and launch them on optical fiber 
at each receiver site  an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers 
sales of products in this category have not historically contributed significantly to the company s revenues 
reception products used to receive television frequency modulated and satellite transmission from off the air prior to headend processing 
sales of products in this category have not historically contributed significantly to the company s revenues  however with the fcc mandate for broadcasters to change from analog to digital  the company experienced a significant increase in the sales of these products during and nevertheless  the company does not expect sales of these products to contribute significantly to the company s revenues in addressable products used to control access to programming at the subscriber s location 
the products offered in this category are interdiction and addressable multi tap amt products 
interdiction products limit the availability of programs to subscribers through jamming of particular channels 
a consumer version of this product  the tv channel blocker parental control  provides local at the consumer level control of the full analog block of channels 
amt products remotely control all access to programming for a particular subscriber 
sales of these products presently do not contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
high speed data products used to provide internet access and transfer data over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable system 
products in this category include standard docsis cable modems  docsis euro docsis cable modem termination systems cmts  and the megaport solution for providing broadband internet access to hospitality and multi dwelling unit environments 
sales of products in this category have not contributed significantly to the company s revenues 
test products used for measuring signals in the headend and distribution system 
among the products offered by the company in this category are analog and digital qpsk analyzers  palm held analog and digital analyzers and signal level meters 
while the company expects to continue selling test products to meet the needs of its customers  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter the functionality of the products 
thus  the inability of a customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand features of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater capability  iii license new technology  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders from such customer s or customer prospects 
projects may also be a result of new technologies that become available  or new market application of existing technology 
in the new product development process  the vast experience of the company s engineering group is leveraged to ensure the highest level of suitability and widest acceptance in the marketplace 
products tend to be developed in a functional building block approach that allows for different combinations of blocks to generate new relevant products as changes in the market demand 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties 
the company will also license technology if it can obtain technology quicker  or more cost effectively from third parties than it could otherwise develop on its own  or if the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december  the company spent  and  on research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products primarily to the following markets the multi dwelling unit market  the lodging market and the institutional market 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through premier authorized stocking distributors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal 
these distributors serve multiple markets 
direct sales to cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal the company s sales and marketing function is predominantly performed by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects or target market opportunities 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes salespersons in old bridge  new jersey  one salesperson in round rock  tx and sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time  when circumstances warrant  such as a commitment to a large blanket purchase order  the company will extend payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows  conferences and maintains a robust website 
the company also publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and train ing to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
customers blonder tongue has a broad customer base  which in consisted of approximately active accounts 
approximately and of the company s revenues in fiscal years and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively of the company s revenues 
in addition  world cinema accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in a third customer  advanced media technologies accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in both and there can be no assurance that any sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed hi storical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
during  the company renewed contracts in regard to its premier distributor program 
this program began in and has been successful for the company 
under this program  a limited group of larger distributors who stock a significant amount of the company s products in their inventory were given access to a special purchase incentive program allowing them to achieve volume price concessions measured on a year to year basis 
many of the company s smaller business customers with whom the company had formerly dealt on a direct basis now purchase the company s products directly from these premier distributors 
in the company s direct sales to system integrators  the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and as such the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators that may replace the present lead ing customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives some revenues from customers outside the continental united states  primarily in canada and to a more limited extent  in underdeveloped countries 
television service is less developed in many international markets  particularly latin america  eastern europe and asia  creating opportunity for those participants who offer quality products at a competitive price 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately of the company s revenues in both fiscal years and all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the continental united states are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no material foreign currency transactions 
in connection with the company s initiatives in the prc  the company may have foreign currency transactions and may be subject to various currency exchange control programs related to its prc operations 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risk of foreign operations 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s manufacturing operations are presently located at the company s headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the programming  assembly  and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chasses and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement improvements to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor to accommodate increasingly fine pitch surface mount electronic components 
in  these improvements included xmil ball grid arrays and packaged siz ed components 
these advancements required investment in upgrading automatic placement equipment as well as automated optical inspection and testing systems 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
in the company entered into a manufacturing agreement with a key contract manufacturer in the prc that governs the production of certain of the company s products upon a purchase order being submitted by the company 
the initiative continued in and further implementation in phases is expected over the next few years 
outside contractors supply standard components  etch printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the compone nt shortage 
on an as needed basis  the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as echostar digital receivers for delivery of dish network programming  and directv digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of certain of these components would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the company 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which monitors and controls manufacturing processes  and extensively tests samples throughout the process 
samples of component parts purchased are tested  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis

blonder tongue performs final product tests prior to shipment to customers 
in  the company was certified to perform underwriters laboratories ul witness testing of products to ul international standard the company is working towards complete certification to perform all ul testing 
competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue that have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance  quality  price  terms  service  technical support and administrative support 
the company believes it differentiates itself from competitors by continuously offering innovative products  providing excellent technical service support and delivering high performance to cost ratio products 
intellectual property the company currently holds united states patents and foreign patents  none of which are considered material to the company s present operations because they do not relate to high volume applications 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable television industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products that are designed to meet its customers needs and that have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has a registered trademark on blonder tongue and also on a bt logo 
in  the company obtained licenses for a variety of technologies in concert with its new digital encoder line of products 
the licenses are from a number of companies including dolby laboratories licensing corporation expires august  digital content protection  llc expires april  dtla expires april   and zenith electronics  llc expires december 
these standard licenses are all non exclusive and require payment of royalties based upon the unit sales of the licensed products 
with regard to the licenses expiring in  the company expects to renew these standard licenses on similar terms 
dolby laboratories licensing corporation licensed the company to use the dolby digital plus professional encoder channel license technology which is an enhanced coding system based on the ac codec 
the company became a full adopter of hdcp license technology from digital content protection  llc  which allows the company to manufacture hdcp components and products  as well as purchase the hdcp device key sets necessary for manufacturing these products 
the company became a full adopter of dtcp license technology from dtla  which aims at encrypting interconnections between devices 
the company has entered into a license agreement with zenith electronics  llc as a pro idiom content protection system manufacturer 
the pro idiom digital technology platform was developed by zeni th electronics  now lg electronics 
the company owns an mpeg profile high level video encoder ip core 
this is a unique compression engine capable of creating hd mpeg ip real time encoding of a single channel of i p i video 
this real time encoding technique is based on a fast hardware technology which enables the company to provide broadcast mpeg hd and sd encoding 
the company is also a licensee of philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate  philips broadband networks  inc  motorola  hughes and several smaller software development companies 
under the philips license agreements  the company is granted a non exclusive license for remote interdiction equipment for a term which expires in  concurrently with the last to expire of the relevant patents 
the philips license agreements provide for the payment by the company of a one time license fee and for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
however  upon expiration of these patents  this becomes a fully paid  royalty free and perpetual license 
during  the company entered into several software development and license agreements for specifically designed controller and interface software necessary for the operation of the company s video central remote interdiction control system  which is used for remote operation of videomask signal jammers installed at subscriber locations 
these licenses are perpetual and require the payment of a one time license fee and in one case additional payments  the aggregate of which are not material 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
the fcc originally mandated that all analog broadcasts were to cease by february   however  this date was extended to june  in anticipation of this analog shut down  the fcc also granted second licenses to all broadcasters to begin simulcasting digital signals 
as a result  during the company experienced an increase in sales of digital transition headend products 
going forward  the company anticipates a continuing shift in product mix from analog products to digital products  although the timeframe is uncertain 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company did not incur in and does not anticipate incurring in material capital expenditures for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company has authorization to discharge wastewater under the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system discharge to surface waters general industrial stormwater permit  permit no 
nj this permit will expire may  employees as of february   the company employed approximately people  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in a general and administrative capacity 
of these employees are full time employees 
of the company s employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  which has a three year labor agreement with the company expiring in february  item a risk factors the company s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following risk factors highlights some of these risks 
additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company now deems immaterial may also affect the company and the value of its common stock 
the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
solely for purposes of the risk factors in this item a  the terms we  our and  us refer to blonder tongue laboratories  inc and its subsidiaries 
any substantial decrease in sales to our largest customer may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to this customer will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
we anticipate  however  that this customer will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods  although it is not obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
with respect to our direct sales to system integrators  the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
we believe that many integrators will grow rapidly  and  as such  our success with them will depend in part on the viability of those customers  our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects  and our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to our five largest customers 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  their inability to pay their trade accounts owing to us  or our inability to develop solid relationships with integrators that may replace the present leading customers  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to reduce expenses or increase revenues may cause continued net losses 
we have had annual net losses each year since while management believes its plan to reduce expenses and increase revenues will improve profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant increase to inventory reserves due to inadequate reserves in a prior period or to an increase in excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we continually analyze our slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices  we establish reserves 
if we do not meet our sales expectations  these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
we recorded an increase in reserve of  and  during and respectively 
although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value  there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future 
significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to develop  or acquire the rights to  technology  products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability 
both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to be successful  we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs  through the timely development and introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties 
this is particularly true at this time as the company must develop and market new digital products to offset the expected decline in sales of analog products 
although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own  or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party 
there can  however  be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally  we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs  technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed  or successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
anticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than us  which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we have 
we expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional compet ition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through price reductions  loss of market share  delays in the timing of customer orders  and an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market 
our sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the cable infrastructure operators that we serve in the mdu  lodging and institutional cable markets 
the vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years and came from sales of our products for use by cable infrastructure operators 
demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
capital spending by private cable operators and  therefore  our sales and profitability  are dependent on a variety of factors  including access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures  demand for their cable services  availability of alternative video delivery technologies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over build existing cable system infrastructures  or constructing  rebuilding  maintaining and upgrading their systems 
there can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining  or upgrading their systems 
any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions 
during the second half of  through  and into the first quarter of  the us economy has experienced a significant downturn that has resulted in elevated levels of financial market volatility  customer uncertainty and widespread concerns about the us and world economies 
this may negatively impact the demand for our products and our allowance for doubtful accounts  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  this economic crisis has had a material and direct impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital  which may impact our ability to borrow funds to support operations or other liquidity needs under our credit facility or otherwise borrow or raise capital 
moreover  our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business  financial condition or results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn 
any significant casualty to our facility in old bridge  new jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations 
we operate out of one manufacturing facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility 
while we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance  a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of the ability to manufacture at  or otherwise use  that facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices 
we purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as certain components of echostar s digital satellite receiver decoders  which are specifically designed to work with the dish network  and certain components of hughes network systems digital satellite receivers which are specifically designed to work with directv programming 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  our receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices  or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products 
our contract manufacturing in the prc may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political  regulatory  legal and labor conditions in the prc 
during the fourth quarter of  we began manufacturing and assembling some of our products in the people s republic of china  or prc  under a contract manufacturing arrangement with a certain key chinese manufacturer 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to  or any other problems arising from  having our products manufactured in the prc  including the following risks political  economic and labor instability  changes in foreign government laws and regulations  infringement of our intellectual property rights  and difficulties in managing foreign manufacturing operations 
although the prc has a large economy  its potential economic  political  legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks 
in the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to manufacture in the prc after products have been successfully transitioned out of the united states  our business will suffer 
shifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense 
over time we may shift a significant amount of our manufacturing operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency 
this could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future  which in turn could entail significant one time earnings charges to account for severance  equipment write offs or write downs and moving expenses 
competitors may develop products that are similar to  and compete with  our products due to our limited proprietary protection 
we possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
patent infringement claims against us or our customers  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant costs 
while we do not believe that our products including products and technologies licensed from others infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted against us or our customers 
damages for violation of third party proprietary rights could be substantial  in some instances damages are trebled  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims  we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances  a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to obtain a license to a third party s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental regulation of the cable markets that we serve  including the mdu  lodging and institutional markets  may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the mdu  lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry  which represents the vast majority of our business  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on these cable markets resulting in  among other things  barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures 
any such regulations  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
private cable system operation is not presently burdened with significant government regulation  other than  in some cases  certain fcc licensing requirements 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted which would re impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in  among other things  the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas 
any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
we do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us 
further  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations 
any failure by us to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
losing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees  or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees  could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel  including james a 
luksch  chief executive officer  and robert j 
pall  president and chief operating officer 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  manufacturing  marketing and managerial personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our organizational documents and delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in additi on  our restated certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting  does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors  does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings  provides for a classified board of directors  and imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to affect certain corporate actions 
these provisions and the board s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire our company  preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock  or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company 
we are also afforded the protection of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  impede a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
it is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our loan agreement with sovereign business capital prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our common stock 
potential fluctuations in the stock price for our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and market conditions for cable industry stocks in general  potential fluctuations in the stock price for our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and market conditions for cable industry stocks in general  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
delays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement or other difficulties in our relationship with our union employees may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations 
all of our direct labor employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local the union  under a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in february in connection with negotiations to renew this agreement in february  the union instituted a work stoppage for approximately two business days prior to signing the agreement and returning to work 
while we believe any differences with the union were resolved when the agreement was signed and the employees returned to work  there can be no assurance that further work stoppages will not occur or that we will be able to agree upon terms for future agreements with the union 
any further work stoppages could have a material adve rse effect on our business operations  results of operations and financial condition

critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
you should also review note to the financial statements for further discussion of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company records revenue when products are shipped 
legal title and risk of loss with respect to the products pass to customers at the point of shipment 
customers do not have a right to return products shipped 
products carry a three year warranty  which amount is not material to the company s operations 
inventory and obsolescence the company periodically analyzes anticipated product sales based on historical results  current backlog and marketing plans 
based on these analyses  the company estimates and projects those products that are unlikely to be sold during the next twelve months 
inventories that are not anticipated to be sold in the next twelve months  have been classified as non current 
this procedure has been applied to the december  and inventories and  accordingly   and  respectively  have been classified to non current assets 
approximately of the non current inventories are comprised of finished goods 
the company has established a program to use interchangeable parts in its various product offerings and to modify certain of its finished goods to better match customer demands 
in addition  the company has instituted additional marketing programs to dispose of the slower moving inventories 
the company continually analyzes its slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes for finished goods  historical and projected usage of raw materials  and anticipated selling prices  the company establishes reserves 
if the company does not meet its sales expectations these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
during and  the company recorded an increase to its reserve of  and  respectively 
the increases in the inventory reserve during and were primarily the result of an increase in certain obsolete raw materials 
the company believes reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable valu e 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from customers to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectability of those balances 
management s estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowances and net earnings 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions  these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value may be impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
if impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the long lived asset 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each long lived asset are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in their impairment analyses may not be achieved 
valuation of deferred tax assets management periodically evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income tax assets considering several factors  including the estimate of the likelihood that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse 
due to the uncertainties related to  among other things  the extent and timing of future taxable income  which indicated that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize the benefits related to the deferred tax assets  the company recorded a valuation allowance equal to a significant portion of the net deferred tax assets as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb  in june  issued new accounting guidance that established the fasb accounting standards codification  codification or asc as the single source of authoritative gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities  except for the rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead the fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
accounting st andards updates will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the codification 
these changes and the codification itself do not change gaap 
this new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of these changes did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance  under asc topic on subsequent events  which sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material eff ect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb issued asc topic consolidation variable interest entities asc topic  to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the company will review the requirements of asc topic and comply with its requirements 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic transfers and servicing sale of financial assets asc topic  to improve the reporting for the transfer of financial assets resulting from practices that have developed since the issuance of asc topic  transfers and servicing  that are not consistent with the original intent and key requirements of that statement and concerns of financial statement users that many of the financial assets and related obligations that have been derecognized should continue to be reported in the financial statements of transferors 
asc topic must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the company does not currently engage in the transfer of financial assets and  therefore  does not expect that the adoption of asc topic will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  fasb issued accounting standards update which includes amendments to subtopic  fair value measurements and disclosure overall 
the update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the techniques provided for in this update 
the amendments in this update clarify that a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liab ility when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the fasb has published fasb accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation an d requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and also requires expanded disclosures 
fasb accounting standards update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the fasb  the emerging issues task force and the sec have issued certain other accounting standards updates and regulations as of december  that will become effective in subsequent periods  however  management of the company does not believe that any of those updates would have significantly affected the company s financial accounting measures or disclosures had they been in effect during or  and it does not believe that any of those pronouncements will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements at the time they become effective
