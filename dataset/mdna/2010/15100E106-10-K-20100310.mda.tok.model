item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following management s discussion and analysis is to provide an overview of the business of celera to help facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing our historical operating results  financial condition  and liquidity and also to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known trends  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to impact our future results 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods 
business overview we are a healthcare business focusing on the integration of genetic testing into routine clinical care through a combination of products and services incorporating proprietary discoveries 
we are organized into three reporting segments a clinical laboratory testing service business lab services  a products business products  and a segment that includes other activities under corporate management corporate 
our lab services business  conducted through berkeley heartlab  inc bhl  offers a broad portfolio of clinical laboratory tests and disease management services designed to help physicians improve cardiovascular disease treatment regimens for their patients 
our products business develops  manufactures  and oversees the commercialization of molecular diagnostic products 
most of this business is conducted through distribution and royalty agreements with abbott molecular  a subsidiary of abbott laboratories 
our corporate segment includes revenues from royalties  licenses  funded collaborations and milestones related to the licensing of certain intellectual property and from our former small molecule and proteomic programs 
relationship with applied biosystems now life technologies prior to july   we operated as a reporting unit of applied biosystems  formerly known as applera  and not as a stand alone company 
applied biosystems established the following two classes of common stock  sometimes referred to as tracking stocks  which were intended to reflect separately the relative performance of applied biosystems two businesses applied biosystems group common stock that was intended to reflect the relative performance of the applied biosystems group  and celera group common stock that was intended to reflect the relative performance of the celera group 
on july   applied biosystems separated the celera group reporting unit from applied biosystems remaining businesses by means of a redemption of each outstanding share of celera group common stock in exchange for one share of common stock of celera corporation 
upon the separation  we held all of the businesses  assets and liabilities attributed to the celera group and became an independent  publicly traded company 
our common stock began trading on the nasdaq stock market on july  under the symbol cra 
in november  applied biosystems merged with invitrogen corporation to form a new company  life technologies corporation life technologies 
the contractual and commercial relationships we had with applied biosystems are now held with life technologies as successor to applied biosystems 
applied biosystems is referred to as life technologies in this annual report on form k and our original contractual relationships with applied biosystems are referred to as contractual relationships with life technologies  its successor 
prior to the split off  we received substantial administrative services and management from life technologies  and engaged in some related party transactions with life technologies 
we also benefited from free access to all of life technologies technology and know how  and license agreements that life technologies had entered into with third parties related to intellectual property 

table of contents although we are now an independent public company  we continue to have contractual and commercial relationships with life technologies 
we entered into a separation agreement and several related agreements with life technologies in connection with the split off 
these agreements govern our relationship with life technologies after the split off and provide for the allocation of employee benefit  tax and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods before the split off 
these agreements also include arrangements with respect to intellectual property and a number of ongoing commercial relationships 
basis of presentation prior to the split off  celera was a reportable segment of life technologies and our financial information was included in life technologies consolidating financial information 
our consolidated financial statements prior to july  include the assets and liabilities of life technologies that were specifically attributed to us 
following the split off  on july   we became a stand alone company with our own consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the comparability of certain items has been affected  including stockholders equity 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of bhl  and substantially all of the assets of atria genetics inc atria  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the results of these operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of their acquisition 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
all significant intracompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
fiscal year change in july  our board of directors approved a change of the company s fiscal year from a june fiscal year end to a or week fiscal year generally ending on the last saturday in december 
we filed a transition report on form kt with the sec on march  to report our results for the six months ended december  this annual report on form k is for the year ended december  business developments in february  bhl s clia registered laboratory was accredited by the college of american pathologists 
in february  we established an agreement under which qiagen will distribute a celera molecular multiplex assay 
the assay is the next generation version of qiagen s resplex ii assay for detection of respiratory pathogens 
in february  bhl entered into a national contract with aetna  which has approximately million members  for bhl s test services 
in january  we licensed our kif discoveries to the university of california on behalf of its san francisco campus ucsf 
under the terms of the agreement  ucsf will be allowed to develop and perform its own kif test for three years in california 
in october  bhl entered into collaborative agreements with geisinger medical center and proven diagnostics  a clinical laboratory service recently launched by geisinger health system 
proven diagnostics will provide select diagnostic tools from bhl s menu of proprietary cardiovascular tests and services 
in october  bhl launched a laboratory developed test that identifies a variant in the lpa gene 

table of contents in october  we entered into non exclusive intellectual property license agreements with three laboratory partners to enable them to develop  offer and market a kif test 
the institute for medical diagnostics in berlin  bonn medical laboratories in bonn  and synlab laboratory services in heidelburg are each expected to start offering and marketing a kif test in early in september  we entered into a research collaboration with medco to evaluate whether testing for kif increases patient adherence with statin therapy 
as part of this collaboration  a prospective  randomized  open label  multi center study akrobats  or additional kif risk offers better adherence to statins will be conducted over months to address the primary question of whether patient adherence with newly prescribed statin therapy is higher in those patients tested for kif status than in those who are not offered the test 
in july  we implemented cost saving measures  which included a restructuring program to reduce headcount by approximately full time positions nationally  or of the workforce 
this included a major redeployment of resources at bhl as we realigned our disease management program to a model focused on web and telephone support  which we expect to be more efficient 
in april  bhl entered into an agreement with blue cross and blue shield of alabama to become a preferred medical laboratory pml 
the agreement establishes coverage across blue cross and blue shield s plans in alabama for individuals who are already at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease 
in april  we entered into separate patent license agreements with decode genetics  inc and perlegen sciences  inc 
providing us access to certain genetic markers in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
in january  life technologies granted licenses to two life science companies under its patents relating to real time technology in the human in vitro diagnostics field 
under our agreement with life technologies  revenues from these third party licenses are shared between us and life technologies 
we recorded million in license fees for the year ended december  and expect to record a further million in the quarter ending march  litigation developments in january   bhl filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief and damages in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  against health diagnostic laboratory  inc hdl and several former employees of bhl  including five sales representatives who left the company on january   and two former laboratory employees 
in the litigation  bhl has asserted a number of contractual  tort and statutory claims against the defendants  including claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference with bhl s client relationships 
the defendants activities have been concentrated in the southeast  which historically has been the highest volume sales territory for bhl 
we anticipate an impact of approximately million on revenues as a result of the expected loss of business from accounts serviced by the sales representatives identified in the hdl litigation 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
in preparing these statements  we are required to use estimates and assumptions 
while we believe we have considered all available information  actual results could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment revenues and accounts receivable  asset impairment  
table of contents income taxes  and share based compensation revenues and accounts receivable the following describes only the areas that are most subject to our judgment 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in the normal course of business  we enter into arrangements whereby revenues are derived from multiple deliverables 
in these revenue arrangements  we record revenue as the separate elements are delivered to the customer if the delivered item is determined to represent a separate earnings process  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially in our control 
revenues from multiple element arrangements involving license fees  upfront payments and milestone payments  which are received and or billable in connection with other rights and services that represent our continuing obligations  are deferred until all of the multiple elements have been delivered or until objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements has been established 
we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements based on the prices charged when the similar elements are sold separately to third parties 
if objective and verifiable evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but objective and verifiable evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the revenues from delivered elements are not recognized until the fair value of the undelivered element or elements has been determined 
contract interpretation is normally required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to begin to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
our service revenues include patient test revenues associated with bhl s operations 
we recognize this revenue on completion of the testing process and when the test results are sent to the ordering healthcare provider 
billings for services reimbursed by medicare  private insurance companies and managed care organizations  commonly referred to  collectively  as third party payors  are recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payors 
adjustments to estimated receipts are recorded on settlement either in revenue or in bad debt expense depending on various factors including the type of payor and the age of the underlying receivable 
disease management revenue is deferred and recognized over the period when disease management services are available to the patient 
our product revenues include sales to abbott 
our strategic alliance agreement with abbott was terminated effective october   and replaced with distribution and royalty agreements 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  we recognize product revenue  net of estimated sales returns and allowances  at the time of shipment 
royalties are recognized as earned under the terms of the royalty agreement 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our relationship with abbott 
prior to the termination of the abbott alliance agreement  all revenues  costs and expenses of the alliance were shared equally by both parties 
research and development and administrative costs incurred by us in connection with the abbott alliance prior to its termination are presented on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
at the end of each reporting period  the two companies compared a statement of revenues and expenses for alliance activities recorded by each party 
a calculation was made to determine the amount that needed to be paid to evenly split both the revenue and expenses 
the payment to us was referred to as the equalization payment  which we recorded as revenue 
the timing and nature of equalization revenue led to fluctuations in both reported revenues and gross margins from period to period due to changes in end user sales of alliance products and differences in relative operating expenses between the alliance partners 

table of contents we recognize royalty revenues when earned over the term of the agreement in exchange for the grant of licenses to use our products or some technologies for which we hold patent rights 
we recognize revenue for estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period  based on management s best estimate  which takes into account historical activity  and make revisions for actual royalties received in the following quarter 
historically  these revisions have not been material to our consolidated financial statements 
for those arrangements where royalties cannot be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue based on royalty statements or the receipt of cash from our licensees 
upfront nonrefundable license fees are recognized when due under contractual agreement  unless there are specific continuing performance obligations requiring deferral of all or a portion of these fees 
if we cannot conclude that a license fee is fixed and determinable at the outset of an arrangement  revenue is recognized as payments from third parties become due 
bad debt expense is recorded in sg a expenses in order to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables are reserved based on specific identification and on their respective aging categories 
our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment  and considers the age of the underlying receivables  type of payor  historical and projected collection experience  current economic and business conditions  and other external factors that could affect the collectability of our receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
an account is fully reserved when reasonable collection efforts have been unsuccessful and it is probable the receivable will not be recovered  or when the account is greater than days outstanding 
asset impairment inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
reserves for obsolescence and excess inventory are provided based on historical experience and estimates of future product demand 
if actual demand is less favorable than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required 
investments publicly traded minority equity investments are recorded at fair value  with the difference between cost and fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
when the fair values of these investments decline below cost  and the decline is viewed as other than temporary  the cost basis is written down to fair value  which becomes the new cost basis  and the write down is included in current earnings 
we determine whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary based on the extent to which cost exceeds fair value  the duration of the market decline  the intent to hold the investment  and the financial health of  and specific prospects for  the investee 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually  or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have concluded that our operating segments should be considered as our reporting units for goodwill impairment purposes 
if the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired  the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired 
a two step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if 
table of contents the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired  and the second step of the test is not required 
if necessary  the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill has been assigned 
in determining the fair value of the reporting units  we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting units is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
under the market approach  we estimate the value of the reporting units by comparison to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market 
this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies and or comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
we acquired the atria and bhl trade names in october  these assets are not subject to amortization and are evaluated for impairment using the relief from royalty method 
this requires management to make estimates including forecasted revenue  discount rates and royalty rates 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
we calculate estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  resulting from the use of the asset and its estimated value at disposal and compare it to its carrying value in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based on a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
income taxes deferred taxes represent the difference between the tax bases of assets or liabilities  calculated under tax laws  and the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets include items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations or items that have already been included in our tax return income but have yet to be recorded as income in our consolidated statements of operations 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these assets to offset future taxes 
we determine if a valuation allowance is necessary based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses  tax planning strategies and other positive and negative evidence 
prior to the split off  we were included in the consolidated return of life technologies 
we recorded federal income tax provisions based on life technologies consolidated return approach taking into account our relative contribution positive or negative to life technologies consolidated federal taxable income  tax liability  and tax credit positions 
prior to june   we recorded tax benefits for tax assets that could be used in the 
table of contents current or future periods based on life technologies consolidated return approach 
tax benefits we acquired in business combinations that were used on a life technologies consolidated basis were reimbursed to us 
tax benefits generated by us since july   which could be used on a consolidated basis  were also reimbursed to us by life technologies up to a limit of million 
prior to the split off  life technologies filed state and local income taxes on either a separate  consolidated  or combined basis  depending on the tax laws of the respective jurisdictions 
we recorded state and local income tax provisions and related tax payments or refunds based on our contributions to state or local tax liabilities on a separate return basis 
however  deferred tax assets determined on a separate return basis that were utilized on life technologies consolidated or combined returns due to the income of other members of the consolidated or combined group were eliminated from the deferred tax accounts through our net worth 
therefore  the state deferred tax attributes  as reported  reflect those that are available for carryforward on returns as filed 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
determining an appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
in june  the fasb issued guidance defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position 
this is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required 
both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes 
we adopted the guidance as of july   and as a result we recognized a decrease of million to our accumulated net loss relating to our uncertain tax positions refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation our board of directors has approved the celera corporation stock incentive plan the plan and reserved million shares of our common stock for issuance under the plan 
prior to the split off  our employees  as part of life technologies  were granted stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units related to celera group common stock 
life technologies also sponsored an employee stock purchase plan for celera group common stock 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
similar to other option pricing models  this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options  and changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
the expected term of our stock options is determined based on historical exercise patterns  which factor in the historical weighted average holding period from grant date to settlement date and from vest date to exercise date 
the historical exercise patterns are used to project future settlement of outstanding stock options 
the forfeiture assumption rates are also based on historical experience 
the expected volatility over the expected term is determined based on the historical volatility of our stock 
testing for impairment goodwill we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of  we reduced our forecasted financial results due to a combination of factors  including broad economic pressures and the effects of changing business conditions 
we considered this 
table of contents reduction in our forecast to be an impairment indicator requiring an interim goodwill impairment test to be performed as of june  for each of our reporting units  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent upon a number of assumptions including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
under the market approach  we estimate the value of the reporting units by comparison to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market 
this requires management to make judgments about the selection of comparable companies and or comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
the fair values obtained by these valuation methods are weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value 
based on the results of step one of the impairment test  we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit at june  exceeded its carrying value  and therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no goodwill impairment was recognized 
our annual impairment analysis was performed during the fourth quarter of based on the results of step one of the impairment test  we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit at december  exceeded its carrying value  and therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no goodwill impairment was recognized 
as part of step one of the impairment test  we performed various sensitivity analyses on certain of the assumptions used under the income approach  including forecasted revenues and the discount rate 
we will continue to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in each reporting period in which indicators of impairment are present 
intangible and other long lived assets in connection with the acquisitions of bhl and atria in october  trade names were acquired that were determined to be indefinitely lived 
an impairment analysis for indefinite lived intangible assets is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
the trade names were evaluated for impairment during the fourth quarter of as part of our annual impairment test 
it was determined that the fair value of each trade name exceeded its carrying value  and therefore  no impairment was recognized 
as a result of the impairment indicators described above  we evaluated trade names for impairment at june  using the relief from royalty method 
it was determined that the carrying values of the trade names exceeded their fair values and we recorded pre tax non cash impairment charges for the second quarter of in our corporate segment of million for the bhl trade name and million for the atria trade name 
a total charge of million was recorded in impairment of intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  significant judgments inherent in our analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue growth rates  discount rates and royalty rates 
we will continue to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in each reporting period in which indicators of impairment are present 
we review other long lived assets  including our intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be 
table of contents recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
as a result of the impairment indicators described above  we tested our other long lived assets for impairment at june  and determined that there was no impairment 
we have not performed an additional impairment test of our other long lived assets at december  we will continue to test long lived assets for impairment in each reporting period in which indicators of impairment are present 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our results of operations for the years ended december  and december   the six months ended december  and december   and the years ended june  and as a result of our change in fiscal year end  we reported audited results for the year ended december  and for the six months ended december  unaudited results for the year ended december  and for the six months ended december  have been presented for comparability purposes 
the selected financial information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
dollar amounts in millions years ended six months ended years ended june  december  december  december  december  unaudited unaudited net revenues cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets employee related charges  asset impairments and other legal settlements impairment of intangibles assets operating loss loss on investments interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income 
table of contents the following table sets forth the components of our net revenues from external customers by segment dollar amounts in millions years ended six months ended years ended june  december  december  december  december  unaudited unaudited lab services products corporate net revenues from external customers the following table summarizes our operating income loss by segment dollar amounts in millions years ended six months ended years ended june  december  december  december  december  unaudited unaudited lab services products corporate elimination of intersegment income operating loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  unaudited revenues revenues from our lab services segment for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the prior year 
although sample volume increased marginally  revenue decreased primarily due to lower reimbursement rates  reflecting the impact of denied tests and historical collection activities 
revenues from our products segment for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   revenues were primarily from sales of celera manufactured products and from royalties from sales of realtime tm assays used on the m tm system from abbott 
for the year ended december   revenues for the period ended october  were recorded based on our alliance agreement with abbott and included equalization and related revenues of million 
prior to the termination of our alliance agreement with abbott  effective october   the revenues of our products segment included product sales to abbott at cost and equalization revenue received under the alliance agreement 
equalization revenue resulted from an equal sharing of alliance profits and losses between the alliance partners and varied each period depending on the relative income and expense contribution of each partner 
effective october   the alliance agreement was replaced by a distribution agreement and a royalty agreement 
under the terms of our distribution agreement  abbott is the exclusive distributor for a specified group of our diagnostic products 
sales under the distribution agreement are made to abbott at a price that is based on abbott s end user sales price to third parties 
under the terms of our royalty agreement with abbott  we receive royalties on sales by abbott of m reagents  instruments  service and related consumables 
abbott receives royalties on the sale of certain of our genetic tests 
research and development and administrative costs incurred by us under the terms of the abbott alliance agreement were presented on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
all revenues  costs and 
table of contents expenses of the alliance  prior to its termination  were shared equally by both parties 
the timing and nature of equalization payments led to fluctuations in both reported revenues and gross margins from period to period due to changes in end user sales of alliance products and differences in relative operating expenses between the alliance partners 
corporate revenues  which primarily consist of royalties  licenses and milestones  decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the reduction in revenue was due primarily to a decrease in royalty revenue received from a licensee 
corporate revenues for the year ended december  included licensing revenue of million from life technologies related to human in vitro diagnostics licenses entered into by life technologies during the first quarter of in january  life technologies granted licenses to two life science companies under its patents relating to real time technology in the human in vitro diagnostics field 
under our agreement with life technologies  revenues from these third party licenses are shared between us and life technologies 
we expect to record a further million in the quarter ending march  for these licenses 
revenues for the year ended december  also included million from pharmacyclics  inc related to the execution of an amendment to our licensing agreement 
the year ended december  included licensing revenues of million from beckman coulter  inc beckman coulter  the last payment under this license was received in the three months ended december  gross margin gross margin for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our lab services and corporate segments  partially offset by increased revenue and lower costs in our products segment 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was for both the year ended december  and the year ended december  operating expenses sg a expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to increases in our lab services segment  including a million increase in allowance for doubtful accounts expense and increased costs of million associated primarily with the expansion of our accounts receivable collection activities and the build out of our genetics business 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to a provision for accounts receivable over days outstanding and tests that have been denied for reimbursement 
these balances were primarily due from patients 
sg a expenses decreased by million in our products segment primarily due to reduced employee related costs and the termination of the strategic alliance with abbott  and by million in our corporate segment 
research and development expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period primarily due to the completion of certain discovery research projects  including reduced proteomic based target discovery and validation related activities  and associated lower employee related costs in our corporate and products segments  and the termination of our strategic alliance with abbott 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended december  and december  related to our acquisitions of bhl and atria in october a charge of million was recorded in employee related charges  asset impairments and other expenses for the year ended december  primarily related to the restructuring program announced in july costs associated with the restructuring program included severance and related costs of million  million of which related to our lab services segment  million to our products segment and million to our corporate segment 
in addition  property related costs of million were recorded in our lab services segment 
our corporate segment also included severance and related costs of million and property related costs of million  partially offset by a gain on sale of equipment of million  associated with the closure of our rockville  maryland facility and million related to tax costs associated with the split off from life 
table of contents technologies in july these costs were partially offset by the reversal of a previous charge of million for certain severance related benefits associated with the restructuring of our proteomics based activities in the year ended june  employee related charges  asset impairment and other expenses were million for the year ended december  our lab services segment included severance costs of million  partially offset by the reversal of a previous charge in our corporate segment of million for certain severance related benefits associated with the restructuring of our proteomics based activities in the year ended june  our products segment included restructuring charges of million related to a reduction in our proteomic based activities and million related to a patent infringement suit with innogenetics nv innogenetics 
our corporate segment included million for professional fees related to the split off from life technologies and million related to the realization of pension costs as a result of the split off from life technologies 
our corporate segment also included million for severance costs resulting from the realigning of our r d resources and an asset impairment charge of million 
we recorded a charge of million in our products segment for the year ended december  related to a legal settlement 
our corporate segment included a gain of million for the year ended december  related to the settlement of a litigation matter associated with our former online information business  an information products and service business 
we recorded a million non cash charge for the year ended december  in our corporate segment for the impairment of intangible assets relating to the trade names of bhl and atria 
a non cash charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  in our corporate segment for the impairment of intangible assets relating to the trade name of atria 
operating income loss our lab services segment had an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts expense  a decrease in revenues and increased employee related charges  asset impairments and other expenses 
these changes are further described above 
our products segment had operating income of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  this change was due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in sg a  r d and employee related charges  asset impairments and other expenses  partially offset by a legal settlement charge of million recorded in the year ended december  these changes are further described above

as a result of the split off  we are no longer a member of life technologies consolidated return 
due to our post split off separate taxpayer status and history of losses  management determined at the time of the split off that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets distributed to us in conjunction with the split off would not be realized 
this assessment required significant judgment and analysis of all the positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized 
our history of losses was considered significant negative evidence that was difficult to overcome and outweighed the positive evidence as it related to the future realizability of the net federal and state deferred tax assets 
consequently  a full federal valuation allowance was established after having considered reversing deferred tax liabilities 
these deferred tax assets are expected to expire between and  if not used before then

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are changes in interest rates and changes in equity prices 
changes in interest rates will affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  as well as the value of those investments 
our primary objectives for these investments are to ensure the preservation of capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize returns 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were invested in a diversified  liquid portfolio of corporate bonds  treasury and agency securities  as well as asset backed securities and money market instruments 
to provide an assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we considered the volatility of interest rates experienced in prior years as well as the duration of the holdings in our portfolio 
we determined that it is reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of million 
this loss would only be realized if these investments were sold prior to maturity 
the decline reflects only the direct impact of the change in interest rates 
other market fluctuations  such as changes in credit risk  could result in additional declines in the value of our investment portfolio 
we do not hedge our equity positions in other companies or our short term investments 
our exposure on these instruments is limited to changes in quoted market prices 
for marketable equity securities  a reasonably possible decline in market prices of approximately in the near term would result in a decrease in their fair value of million 
we have minimal direct exposure to foreign currency risk as our operations are primarily in the us and overseas sales are typically billed in us dollars 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation and changing prices are monitored and we attempt to minimize the impact of inflation by improving productivity and efficiency through review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels 
when operating costs increase  we attempt to recover such costs by increasing  over time  the selling price of our products and services 
we believe the effects of inflation have been appropriately managed and therefore have not had a material impact on our historic consolidated operations and resulting financial position
