overview the year ended december  was another difficult year for the us economy and for the financial services industry 
high credit costs  primarily the result of loan portfolio pressure stemming from ongoing deterioration in real estate values  as well as increasing unemployment and other factors  continued to negatively impact earnings 
property value declines  which began in late  continued throughout and while whitney did not have material exposure to many of the issues that originally plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles and collateralized debt obligations  the company s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily residential development activity in the florida market  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and foreclosed asset expenses 
as the economic downturn continued  consumer confidence and weak economic conditions began to impact areas of the economy outside of the housing sector 
under these conditions  whitney reported a net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ended december   or per diluted share  compared with earnings to common shareholders of million for  or 
per diluted share

table of contents loans and earning assets total loans at the end of were down million  or  from december   with reduction in all of the bank s geographic regions and most portfolio segments 
total earning assets at december  were down approximately from the end of the decline in total loans included charge offs of million and foreclosures of approximately million 
as was anticipated and previously disclosed  economic conditions restrained loan demand through whitney continues to seek and fund new credit relationships and to renew existing ones  but the level of overall demand has been insufficient to cover repayments and maturities along with charge offs  foreclosures and other problem loan resolutions 
management believes this situation will continue for the first half of with hope for some slow growth during the second half of in an economy beginning to recover and strengthen 
deposits and funding total deposits at december  decreased approximately  or million  from december   but with a favorable shift in the deposit mix 
noninterest bearing demand deposits grew  or million  from year end  and comprised of total deposits at december  lower cost interest bearing deposits grew  or million  over the same period  reflecting funds attracted to a special money market deposit product introduced in the first half of higher cost time deposits at december  were down  or million  compared to year end  mainly from declines in competitively bid public fund deposits and deposits held in treasury management sweep products used by corporate customers 
the sustained period of low market interest rates has tended to reduce the attractiveness of time deposits compared to alternative deposit products and investments 
the balance of short term borrowings at december   was down  or million  from year end  reflecting mainly restrained loan demand and the overall reduced level of earning assets 
net interest income whitney s net interest income te for decreased million  or  from average earning assets were up between these periods  while the net interest margin te contracted basis points to 
asset yields decreased basis points in mainly from a steep reduction in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loans portfolio 
the cost of funds decreased basis points from mainly from the impact of the sustained low rate environment on both deposit and short term borrowing rates and a favorable shift in the funding mix 
the lost interest on nonaccruing loans reduced the net interest margin by approximately basis points in compared to approximately basis points in provision for credit losses and credit quality whitney increased its provision for credit losses to million in compared to million in provisions related to impaired loans accounted for approximately half of the total provision for credit losses in more than million of the impaired loan provisions came from whitney s florida and alabama markets and reflected in large part the continued decline in the value of underlying real estate collateral 
the remainder of the provision for credit losses for was related to the increase in total criticized loans  the impact of elevated charge off levels on historical loss factors  smaller consumer charge offs and qualitative adjustments 
net loan charge offs were million  or  of average loans in  compared to million  or

the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by million during  which increased the allowance for loan losses to of total loans at december  from at december  the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process was billion at december  this represented of total loans and a net increase of million from december   although the criticized total at year end was down million from its peak at september  criticized commercial and industrial c i relationships increased million from year end this increase came mainly from loans to oil and gas industry customers  although less than of the o g portfolio was considered to be nonperforming at december  criticized commercial real estate loans increased

employee compensation was stable as increases from normal salary adjustments and higher sales based incentives were offset by a reduction in management incentive compensation from tightened performance criteria and the difficult operating environment 
the cost of employee benefits grew approximately million  before considering parish s impact  driven mainly by pension benefits 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section 
allowance for credit losses whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the section below entitled loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in national and local economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 

table of contents goodwill impairment test goodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
the impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value 
whitney has assigned all goodwill to one reporting unit that represents the overall banking operations 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based on valuation techniques that market participants would use in an acquisition of the whole unit  such as estimated discounted cash flows  the quoted market price of whitney s stock including an estimated control premium  and observable average price to earnings and price to book multiples of our competitors 
if the unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  an estimate of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the goodwill s carrying value 
given the volatility in market prices due in part to significant uncertainty about the financial services industry as a whole and limited activity of healthy bank acquisitions  management has placed greater reliance on the discounted cash flow analysis for the annual test 
this analysis requires significant assumptions about the economic environment  expected net interest margins  growth rates and the rate at which cash flows are discounted 
no impairment was indicated when the annual test was performed on september  given the current economic environment and potential for volatility in the fair value estimate  management has been updating the impairment test for goodwill quarterly throughout no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in these interim tests 
for the most recent impairment test as of december   the discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a fair value estimate approximately higher than book value 
either a basis point reduction in the expected net interest margin  a 
lower projected growth rate or a 
higher discount rate would reduce the estimated fair value by approximately 
accounting for retirement benefits management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets

the c i portfolio is diversified over a range of industries  including oil and gas o g  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  marine transportation and maritime construction  hospitality  financial services and professional services 
loans outstanding to o g industry customers declined approximately million during  but still represented approximately  or million  of total loans at december  management monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the majority of whitney s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the bank seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
loans outstanding to the exploration and production sector comprised approximately of the o g portfolio at december  management continues to monitor the impact of weak global economic activity on commodity prices and has made what it believes to be appropriate adjustments to whitney s credit underwriting guidelines with respect to o g loans and the management of existing relationships

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee includes the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the chief risk officer  the president and the chief executive officer 
c i credits and cre loans are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
c i loans are typically relationship based 
table of contents rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with reference to the customer s debt capacity and with the support of automated credit scoring tools  including appropriate secondary review procedures 
lending officers are primarily responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function  which reports to the audit committee of the board of directors  assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a monthly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management as well as the chief executive officer and chief risk officer  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and will assign relationships to a special credits department when appropriate 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is reflected in its estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for credit losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment  and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
this methodology is described in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of the annual report on form k 
the process for determining the recorded allowance involves three key elements establishing specific allowances as needed for loans evaluated for impairment  developing loss factors based on historical loss experience for nonimpaired commercial loans grouped by geography  loan product type and internal risk rating and for homogeneous groups of residential and consumer loans  and determining appropriate adjustments to historical loss factors based on management s assessment of current economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 
during the third quarter of  management enhanced the allowance methodology by expanding the qualitative and environmental factors that are considered and by evaluating and applying loss factors to the loan portfolio at a more granular level to better capture regional distinctions and distinctions among the loan types 
the monitoring of credit risk also extends to unfunded credit commitments  such as unused commercial credit lines and letters of credit  and management establishes reserves as needed for its estimate of probable losses on such commitments 
credit quality statistics and components of credit loss allowance and reserve the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process was billion at december  this represented of total loans and a net increase of million from december   although the criticized total at year end was down million  or  from its peak at september  the range of criticized ratings covers loans with well defined weaknesses that would likely lead to a default if not corrected as well as loans with a high probability of loss but not yet charged off due to specific pending events 
criticized ratings also identify loans that deserve close attention because of potential weaknesses as evidenced by  for example  the borrower s recent operating trends or adverse market conditions

other short term borrowings  which have included purchased federal funds  short term federal home loan bank fhlb advances and borrowing through the federal reserve s term auction facility  decreased million from year end  reflecting the overall reduced level of earning assets and the funds available from the company s recent common stock offering

shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity totaled billion at december   which represented an increase of million from the end of as noted earlier  whitney raised million in the fourth quarter of in an underwritten public offering of million of the company s common shares 
shareholders equity was reduced by the million net loss for and by common dividends declared of million and preferred dividends of million

as a result of the current difficult operating environment and recent operating losses  the bank has committed to its primary regulator that it will implement a plan to maintain higher capital ratios with a leverage ratio of at least  a tier regulatory capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   the bank exceeded the requisite capital levels to both satisfy these target minimums and to qualify as well capitalized by its regulators 
the capital raised by the company in its recent common stock offering strengthens its capacity to serve as a source of financial support to the bank 
voluntary stress test most economic indicators point toward the overall us economy either remaining in a potentially prolonged recessionary period or transitioning to a gradual recovery period 
as a result  during the third quarter of  whitney elected to perform a stress test of the loan portfolio using a similar methodology employed in the supervisory capital assessment program scap  which was designed by banking regulators to stress a financial institution s loan portfolios under different economic scenarios 
the company engaged outside consultants to assist with the details of the scap methodology and to advise the company how to effectively build a model to estimate the bank s potential losses in its loan portfolio 
as a result  whitney s management built a sophisticated model and used it to calculate potential losses at a granular level based upon recent charge off history and adjusted for certain qualitative factors 
whitney segregated each portfolio by geography  loan product type and risk rating and then computed a base loss percentage for each segment based upon a weighted average of charge offs over the past two years 
whitney then adjusted the calculation for qualitative and macroeconomic factors 
finally  it applied the resulting two year charge off percentages to the december  loan portfolio by segment 
actual net charge offs for were less than the most likely base case for the first year of the stress test period and below the most adverse case 
the results of the internal stress test using the original loss projections indicate that the current level of tier common capital is adequate to absorb losses under either the most likely or the most adverse case scenarios 
dividends the company declared a nominal quarterly dividend of 
per share to common shareholders throughout the company must currently obtain regulatory approval before increasing the common dividend rate above this level 
regulatory policy statements provide that generally bank holding companies should only pay dividends out of current operating earnings and that the level of dividends  if any  must be consistent with current and expected capital requirements 
preferred dividends totaled million for in addition to these regulatory requirements and restrictions  whitney s ability to pay common dividends is also limited by its participation in the treasury s cpp 
prior to december   unless the company has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in the cpp or the treasury has transferred the preferred stock to a third party  whitney cannot pay a quarterly common dividend above 
per share 
furthermore  if whitney is 
table of contents not current in the payment of quarterly dividends on the preferred stock  it cannot pay dividends on its common stock 
the common dividend rate will be reassessed quarterly in light of credit quality trends  expected earnings performance and capital levels  limitations resulting from treasury s cpp or regulatory requirements  and the bank s capacity to declare and pay dividends to the company 
given the current operating environment  it is unlikely that whitney will increase its common dividend in the near term 
liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios  including credit stressed conditions 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
at december   securities available for sale with a carrying value of billion  out of a total portfolio of billion  were sold under repurchase agreements  pledged to secure public deposits or pledged for other purposes 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above entitled deposits and borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in in october  the fdic temporarily increased deposit insurance coverage limits for all deposit accounts from  to  per depositor through december  and also offered to provide unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts and certain other specified deposits over the same period 
whitney elected to participate in the unlimited coverage program  including a recent extension of this coverage through june  in june  the fdic extended the period for the expanded  coverage through december  these steps were taken as part of the federal government s response to severe disruption in the credit markets and were designed to support deposit retention and to enhance the liquidity of the nation s insured depository institutions and thereby assist in stabilizing the overall economy 
wholesale funding currently available to the bank includes fhlb advances  federal funds purchased from correspondents and borrowings through the federal reserve s term auction facility 
the bank s unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb at december  totaled approximately billion and is secured by a blanket lien on loans secured by real estate 
the bank s unused borrowing capacity from the federal reserve discount window totaled approximately 
billion at december   based on the collateral pledged 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this funding source to date 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows located in item of this annual report on form k present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  
table of contents in the fourth quarter of  whitney raised million in an underwritten public offering of million of the company s common shares  as was discussed earlier 
at december   the company had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for future dividend payments to its common and preferred shareholders and other corporate purposes 
whitney reduced its quarterly common dividend to 
per share throughout  and the company must currently obtain regulatory approval before increasing the common dividend rate above this rate 
dividends received from the bank have been the primary source of funds available to the company for the declaration and payment of dividends to whitney s shareholders  both common and preferred 
there are various regulatory and statutory provisions that limit the amount of dividends that the bank can distribute to the company 
because of recent losses  the bank currently has no capacity to declare dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
contractual obligations table summarizes payments due from the company and the bank under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts and short term borrowings are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section entitled deposits and borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
during  whitney announced an initiative to replace the bank s core data processing application systems and invest in new customer service technology which will be implemented over a two year period 
obligations under contracts associated with this initiative are included with purchase obligations in table the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and employee compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than in thousands total year years years years loan commitments revolving loan commitments nonrevolving credit card and personal credit lines standby and other letters of credit total revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
a number of such commitments are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although not all are expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments  including the prospect of temporarily increased levels of draws on back up commercial facilities during periods of disruption in the credit markets  are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
historically  the bank has had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
certain financing arrangements supported by letters of credit from the bank are structured as variable rate demand notes that are periodically remarketed to reset the interest rate 
when disruption in the credit markets led to unsuccessful remarketing efforts for some of these financings  the bank assisted its customers by purchasing the underlying instruments until credit market conditions improved sufficiently to restart remarketing efforts or the instruments were refinanced under new arrangements 
the bank no longer held any of these instruments by the end of outstanding letters of credit supporting variable rate demand notes totaled approximately million at december  
table of contents asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity over the near term primarily by running net interest income simulations 
management also monitors longer term interest rate risk by modeling the sensitivity of its economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s investment and asset and liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
based on the simulation run at december   annual net interest income te would be expected to decrease approximately million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased from current rates by basis points 
the sensitivity is measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses forecasts of earning assets and funding sources as of the measurement date and that assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
a comparable simulation run as of december  produced results that indicated a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  from a basis point rate increase 
although whitney has historically tended to be moderately asset sensitive over the near term  the more recent simulations indicate a somewhat liability sensitive position in a rising market rate scenario 
this shift reflects to a large extent the increased use of rate floors on variable rate loans and the extent to which these floors exceed the indexed rate in the current low rate environment 
additional information on variable rate loans and loans with rate floors is included in the following section on net interest income te 
the simulation assuming a basis point decrease from current rates was suspended at both december  and december  in light of the historically low rate environment 
the results of the december  simulation reflect adjustments to the underlying model in light of the unusually low rate environment and they differ from those previously disclosed 
the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on a number of factors 
these factors include whitney s ability to achieve any expected growth in earning assets and to maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing of the repricing of assets and liabilities  the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads  and the level of success of asset liability management strategies that are implemented 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section entitled investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k contain information regarding fair values 
the company has made minimal use of derivative financial instruments as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes  but management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of these instruments 
during  the bank began offering interest rate swap agreements to commercial banking customers seeking to manage their interest rate risk 
for each customer swap agreement  the bank has entered into an offsetting agreement with an unrelated financial institution 

table of contents results of operations net interest income te whitney s net interest income te decreased million  or  in compared to average earning assets were  or million  higher in  largely reflecting the parish acquisition in late  while the net interest margin te contracted basis points to 
the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
tables and provide details on the components of the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
the loan totals in table include loans held for sale 
the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to in this decline resulted mainly from a steep reduction in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio compared to there was a small favorable shift in the earning asset mix between these periods 
the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio declined basis points between and loan yields te for declined basis points compared to the rates on approximately  or billion  of the loan portfolio at year end vary based on libor benchmarks  with another tied to prime 
these percentages are consistent with those at year end the bank has increased the use of rate floors on its loan products which has helped limit the impact of declining benchmark rates on loan yields 
at the end of  approximately of the outstanding balance of its libor prime based loans was subject to rate floors compared to at the end of the disruption in credit markets in the latter part of was reflected in wider than normal spreads for libor rates  which benefited whitney s net interest income and margin for the fourth quarter of and parts of the third quarter 
management estimates that the wider than normal libor spreads added basis points to the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of and basis points to s annual margin 
the higher level of nonaccruing loans in has also reduced net interest income and lowered the effective asset yield 
nonaccruing loans reduced whitney s net interest margin by approximately basis points for  which was basis points more than the estimated impact on the margin for the cost of funds decreased basis points from to 
in the decline reflected mainly the impact of the sustained low rate environment on both deposit and short term borrowing rates

short term borrowing costs decreased basis points over this same period 
noninterest bearing demand deposits funded a favorable of average earning assets in and in  although the benefit to the net interest margin was somewhat muted by the lower rate environment in the current period

table of contents there are several factors that will challenge whitney s ability to increase net interest income and expand the net interest margin in the near future 
continued weak loan demand will make it difficult to grow earning assets and maintain the proportion of loans in the earning asset mix 
the rates on many variable rate loans with rate floors currently exceed the underlying indexed market rates 
this will limit the benefit to whitney s loan yields from any rise in market rates as the economy recovers 
whitney continues to manage its deposit rates and funding mix to maintain a favorable net interest margin  but the ability to further reduce funding costs has become limited after the sustained period of low market rates 
net interest income te decreased million  or  in compared to average earning assets were  or million  higher in  while the net interest margin te contracted basis points to 
the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to in  again mainly from a steep reduction in benchmark rates for variable rate loans 
the higher level of nonaccruing loans in lowered the effective yield by approximately basis points  but this was offset by the impact of the wider than normal libor spreads discussed earlier 
loan yields te for declined basis points compared to there was a favorable shift in the earning asset mix between these periods  with loans comprising of average earning assets for compared to in the yield te on the fixed rate investment portfolio was stable between and the overall cost of funds decreased basis points from to noninterest bearing demand deposits funded of average earning assets in both and  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources was in compared to in rates on interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings during were down sharply from  consistent with general market rate movements that were driven by the slowing economy and the trend toward liquidity and safety by investors and savers 
the reduction in funding costs from declining rates was partially offset by the impact of a shift between these years toward higher cost sources  which includes time deposits and borrowings 
this shift mainly reflected the increased use of short term borrowings to support earning asset growth 
provision for credit losses whitney increased its provision for credit losses to million in compared to million in provisions related to impaired loans accounted for approximately half of the total provision for credit losses in more than million of the impaired loan provisions came from whitney s florida and alabama markets and reflected in large part the continued decline in the value of underlying real estate collateral 
the remainder of the provision for credit losses for was related to the increase in total criticized loans  the impact of elevated charge off levels on historical loss factors  smaller consumer charge offs and qualitative adjustments 
net loan charge offs were million  or  of average loans in  compared to million  or 
of average loans  in florida loans generated approximately million of the million of gross charge offs for the gross charge offs were heavily concentrated in residential related real estate loans 
the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by million during  which increased the allowance for loan losses to of total loans at december  from at december  for a more detailed discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses  the reserve for losses on unfunded credit commitments  nonperforming assets and general credit quality  see the earlier section entitled loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
the future level of the allowance and reserve and the provisions for credit losses will reflect management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk  based on established internal policies and practices 

table of contents noninterest income table shows the components of noninterest income for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
in  whitney recognized a million gain from the mandatory redemption of a portion of its visa shares in connection with visa s restructuring and initial public offering

reduced overall economic activity and conservative behavior by whitney s customers in response to economic uncertainty limited the opportunity for growth in certain income categories in  including deposit service charges and bank card fees 
the company is monitoring recent legislative proposals that would impose limits on certain deposit and other transaction fees and potentially reduce the bank s fee income 
income from service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  in on higher commercial account fees and the impact of parish 
this followed an  or million  increase between and also on higher commercial account fees 
service charges include periodic account maintenance fees for both commercial and personal customers  charges for specific transactions or services such as processing return items or wire transfers  and other revenue associated with deposit accounts such as commissions on check sales 
the fees charged on a large number of whitney s commercial accounts are based on an analysis of account activity  and these customers are allowed to offset accumulated charges with an earnings credit based on balances maintained in the account 
the growth in commercial fees in each period was driven in large part by a reduction in the earnings credit allowance in the low market rate environment  although the impact was muted by higher account balances maintained in personal account service charges have been relatively stable  with aggressive competition holding down the pricing for fees charged to service these deposit accounts 

table of contents charges earned on specific transactions and services in increased  or 
million  compared to charges had decreased  or 
million  in compared to without parish s contribution  there would have been a decrease of over million in reflecting in part the conservative customer behavior discussed above 
broad trends in how customers execute transactions have also been reducing charging opportunities in recent years 
the main component of this income category is fees earned on items returned for insufficient funds and for overdrafts 
fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations grew million in  nearly double the level in this fee income category was stable between and the low interest rate environment prompted increased refinancing activity in and results for the year also benefited from the addition of parish s mortgage operations 
relatively broad weakness in the overall housing market was apparent in the latter part of and continued throughout and into the market improved as progressed  but it is unclear if continued improvement will generate loan production sufficient to offset an anticipated decrease in refinancing activity 
whitney has positioned resources in those parts of its market area with the best potential for loan production 
the parish acquisition also benefited bank card fees  although most of the increase in this income category in reflected a change in the reporting of certain transactions by a new processor  with the offset in the atm fees category 
excluding the impact of this change in  bank card fees increased  or 
million  in and  or million  in this income category includes fees from activity on bank issued debit and credit cards as well as from merchant processing services 
trust service fees declined  or million  in and were essentially unchanged between and under difficult financial market conditions 
whitney has positioned relationship officers to attract and service trust and wealth management customers across its market area 
whitney implemented a bank owned life insurance program in may earnings on the million used to purchase policies under this program increased million in compared to in the latter part of  the bank began offering interest rate swap agreements to commercial banking customers seeking to manage their interest rate risk 
income related to this service added 
million to other operating income in the visa share redemption gain and the insurance settlement gain mentioned above are included in the totals for other operating income for and  respectively

this followed an increase of  or million  from to  when acquired operations contributed approximately million to the total change 
the increase in compensation unrelated to acquisitions of million reflected normal salary adjustments and higher sales based incentive program compensation related mainly to secondary mortgage operations 
the average full time equivalent staff level was down slightly between and  excluding the impact of acquired staff 
the compensation added for normal salary adjustments in was partly offset by the favorable impact of a reduction in the average full time equivalent staff level compared to  excluding the acquired staff 
sales based incentive program compensation increased only slightly in  consistent with the level of growth in fee based income categories discussed earlier 

table of contents compensation expense associated with management incentive programs decreased by million in and million in  largely as a result of tightened performance criteria coupled with the current difficult operating environment 
no bonus was earned under the cash bonus incentive program for or reduced share based compensation has reflected in part the lower estimated cost of more recent awards relative to the cost of prior awards that vested in and share based incentives currently include restricted stock units  both performance based and tenure based  and stock options

employee benefits expense increased  or million  in  following a decrease of  or 
million  in the major components of employee benefits expense  in addition to payroll taxes  are the cost of providing pension benefits through both the defined benefit plans and a k employee savings plan and the cost of providing health benefits for active and retired employees 
the increase in employee benefits expense in was driven mainly by the cost of providing pension benefits 
the addition of the parish staff added approximately million to benefits expense for the performance of the pension trust fund for was substantially below the long term expected rate of return  reflecting conditions in the equity and corporate debt markets 
this level of fund performance contributed to an increase of million in the actuarially determined periodic expense for the defined benefit pension plan in as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  whitney amended its qualified defined benefit pension plan in late to limit future eligibility and to freeze benefit accruals for certain current participants 
at the same time  the employee savings plan was amended to authorize the company to make discretionary profit sharing contributions  beginning in  on behalf of participants in the savings plan who are ineligible to participate in the qualified defined benefit plan or subject to the freeze in benefit accruals 
the discretionary profit sharing contribution added million to expense 
net occupancy expense increased  or million  in  following a  or million  increase in compared to the incremental impact of acquired operations totaled approximately million in and 
million in increased expenses related to de novo branch expansion and higher energy costs drove most of the remaining increase for equipment and data processing expense increased  or 
million  in the incremental costs for acquired operations totaled approximately million in costs added in related to the initiative to replace the core data processing system  the opening of a new operations center and various new and enhanced applications  were offset by savings achieved on certain major contract renewals and the elimination of some costs associated with the bank s response to operational difficulties encountered in the aftermath the major hurricanes in equipment and data processing expense in was up over  driven in large part by the cost of new customer oriented applications associated with strategic initiatives and by branch expansion 
acquired operations contributed 
million to the increase 
the total expense for professional services  both legal and other services  increased million in and million in legal expense increased million to a total of million in and was up million in each increase came mainly from higher costs associated with problem loan collection efforts

table of contents other costs associated with problem loan collections and foreclosed assets increased million in  including a million additional provision to increase the valuation allowance on foreclosed property 
these costs were up million in compared to expenses associated with problem loan collections and foreclosed assets are expected to remain elevated in the near term 
the million reduction in telecommunications and postage expense in mainly reflected the elimination of some redundant communication services used during an upgrade project in this was part of the overall efforts to improve operational resiliency in the event of a natural disaster 
amortization of intangibles is associated mainly with the value of deposit relationships acquired in bank and branch acquisitions 
amortization expense of million is scheduled for note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k reviews recently completed acquisitions and note presents additional information on intangible assets subject to amortization 
the expense for deposit insurance and other regulatory fees in was up million compared to recent bank failures and economic conditions have put pressure on deposit insurance reserve ratios and led the fdic to introduce a higher rate structure in whitney also elected to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program that provides for full deposit insurance coverage for specified deposit categories
