critical accounting policies and estimates the company strives to report its financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
it follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing its consolidated financial statements  which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations 
there have been no material changes in the company s policies or estimates since december  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances  there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable is followed 
actual collections may differ  requiring adjustments to the reserves 

table of contents inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  judgments are made as to future demand requirements and compared with current inventory levels 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory based on material movement  market conditions  and technological advancements 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted for by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the company accounts for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with asc  which requires the company to test the recorded amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for recovery on an annual basis  or more frequently if a triggering event occurs 
the company tests for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
impairment indicators could include a significant adverse change in the business climate  operating performance indicators  or the decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment analysis goodwill is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
as such  the company has determined that the color measurement and color standard segments meet the requirement of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill evaluation 
in step one of the goodwill evaluation process  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value 
the company must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value  and a combination of present value techniques and quoted market prices are used to determine fair value 
if the fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is not impaired for that reporting unit  and no further testing would be required 
if the fair value is less than book value  a step two analysis must be completed 
step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 
the following valuation methodologies and assumptions were used in the goodwill impairment analysis as of and for the year ended january  discounted cash flow method under the income approach whereby cash flows were discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the application of the discounted cash flow method required the development of discrete cash flow projections for the color measurement and color standard reporting units 

table of contents the company considered the value indicators provided by the guideline company method gcm under the market approach  in addition to the implied control premium in evaluating the reasonableness of the fair value results 
discount rates for the reporting units ranged from percent to percent 
the discount rate was developed utilizing the capital asset pricing model through which a weighted average cost of capital was derived 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
based on the results of our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill  the fair values of the color measurement and color standard reporting units exceeded book value  and accordingly  there was no impairment of goodwill as of and for the year ended january  based on the results of the annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill  the fair value of the color measurement reporting unit exceeded book value  and accordingly  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the color standard reporting unit fair value was less than the book value  and the company completed a step two analysis 
the results of the step two analysis resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the total impairment loss in amounted to million  of which related to the impairment of goodwill and the remaining related to the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs 
differences in the company s actual future cash flows  results of operations  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for purposes of calculating the respective reporting unit fair values could affect the results of the annual goodwill evaluation and could potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges 
indefinite lived intangible impairment analysis indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the discounted cash flows 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value  and an impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying value 
the following valuation methodologies and assumptions were used in the analysis of the indefinite lived intangible asset the income approach  utilizing the relief from royalty method  was used to estimate fair value 
relief from royalty rate considered publicly disclosed arm s length licensing agreements  review of internal licensing agreements  and other factors 
future projections are based on past performance estimate of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates weighted average cost of equity the methodology for valuing indefinite lived intangible assets is applied consistently 
the company believes the discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the indefinite lived intangible assets projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company s intangible assets in an orderly transaction 

table of contents the company did not recognize an impairment loss on its indefinite lived intangible assets in  and recognized an impairment loss of million in financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  debt and interest rate caps 
the company s estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of january  and january  the company applies the fair value measurement guidance in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
asc applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis and provides the framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to movements in interest rates 
derivatives are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
the company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging 
as a result the company recognizes derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of the instruments 
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective hedges  are originally recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in earnings immediately 
deferred income tax valuation allowance the company periodically evaluates its deferred income tax assets to assess the probability of ultimate realization 
upon determination that a deferred income tax asset may not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the potential unrealizable amount 
this evaluation process requires a review of the underlying transaction to determine that the conditions that led to the creation of the asset still exist and that the related tax benefit will be realized 
uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of asc  income taxes  as it relates to uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the company deems the estimates related to this provision to be reasonable  however no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not vary from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
software development costs development costs incurred for research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is achieved 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
after technological feasibility is achieved  any additional development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and then amortized using the straight line method over a three year period 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of products and services is recognized when a purchase order has been received  the product has been shipped or the service has been performed  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of any resulting receivable is probable 

table of contents for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has no significant off balance sheet transactions other than operating leases for equipment  real estate  and vehicles

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  and market volatility in its derivative and insurance portfolios 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established procedures to evaluate its risks and take corrective actions when necessary to manage these exposures 
the company does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rates the company is subject to interest rate risk principally in relation to variable rate debt 
the company previously utilized interest rate swap contracts to manage the potential variability in interest rates associated with debt incurred in connection with past acquisitions 
the company terminated the interest rate swap agreements on april  on december   the company replaced these swap agreements with an interest rate cap 
the interest rate cap limits the company s exposure to an increase in the month libor rate above percent per annum 
the counterparty to the company s interest rate cap is a major financial institution with which the company also has other financial relationships 
the counterparty exposes the company to credit loss in the event of non performance 
if the counterparty fails to meet the term of the agreement  the company s exposure is limited to the cost of a replacement agreement 
the company does not anticipate non performance by the counterparty  and no material loss would be expected from non performance by the counterparty 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates during the year ended january  would have increased the interest expense reported in the consolidated financial statements by million 
foreign exchange foreign currency exchange risks arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency and from foreign denominated transactions translated into us dollars 
the company s largest exposures are to the euro and swiss franc 
as these currencies fluctuate relative to the dollar  it may cause profitability to increase or decrease accordingly 
the hypothetical effect on net income caused by a percent change in all foreign currencies would be approximately and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
there were no foreign currency hedges or derivative financial instruments to offset foreign currency exchange risk exposure in place as of january
