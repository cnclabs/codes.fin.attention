item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages all aspects of the timberlands including harvesting and sale of timber  timberland sales and acquisitions  oil and gas mineral revenues  and hunting land leases  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant and consistent source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands in accordance with sustainable forest initiative sfi standards  which provide guidance for deltic in managing these assets 
deltic s goal in managing its timber assets is to increase productivity and maximize the long term value 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market in its operating regions 
deltic derives additional revenues from its timberlands in the form of hunting leases  mineral lease rentals  mineral royalties  and land easements 
in late  the company implemented a timberland acquisition program to enable it  when desired  to increase harvest levels  while expanding its timber inventory 
the company continues to focus its acquisition program on timberland within its current operating area 
additionally  as market conditions allow  deltic will sell tracts of land where market values exceed that of the tracts worth as a timber growing platform replacing the non strategic acres with strategic southern yellow pine sawtimber producing acres 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality  with safety being one of its highest priorities 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the company s timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  timbers  and boards 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  large retailers  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the southern and mid western united states and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to maximize the value of former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a premier planned community consisting of  acres of residential and commercial properties 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and is developing red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 

table of contents the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began in the plant is designed to have a rated annual production capacity of million square feet mmsf on a inch basis  making it one of the largest plants of its type in north america 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  store fixture  laminate flooring  and molding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  pressed and held together by an adhesive bond 
executive overview deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment  with a major diversification in real estate development 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  availability and costs of credit  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  new and existing home inventories  home foreclosures  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw materials  cost of fuel  and weather conditions 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no influence over the market s pricing levels for its wood products 
accordingly  the company has and will continue to make increasing productivity and reducing controllable costs and expenses from its manufacturing processes a major goal 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions  interest rates  home foreclosures  new and existing home inventories  and the availability and cost of credit  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
significant accomplishments for the company s operating segments during the year of include the woodlands segment successfully acquired approximately  acres of strategic pine timberland within its areas of operations  the woodlands segment closed on sales of approximately  acres of non strategic  recreational use hardwood bottomland  the mills segment achieved positive cash flow through operating efficiencies  lower log supply cost  and improved hourly productivity rates  and the real estate segment completed an acre commercial real estate acreage sale to a major health care provider in the state of arkansas for  per acre 
the woodlands segment continued to be the company s established core operating segment  even though operating income decreased from by million  or percent 
the decline was mainly due to lower per ton sales prices for pine sawtimber and pulpwood and fewer acres of non strategic hardwood bottomland sold with a lower per acre sales price 
the sawtimber harvest volume decreased slightly to  tons when compared to s volume of  tons  and the average sales price decreased percent to per ton 
according to some analysts  the housing market may have reached bottom during and the market could improve gradually during  which may result in increased demand and higher prices for stumpage 
the pine pulpwood harvest volume was  tons  a percent decrease from s harvest volume of  tons  as a result of wet logging conditions  while s average per ton sales price of was a percent decrease from s price of per ton as pulpwood prices decreased from the near record prices of as pulpwood supply availability improved 
while lumber production levels within a region can influence pine sawtimber prices  lumber prices themselves typically do not 
over the long term  there is a fundamental correlation between lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices 
however  in the short term  the geographical size differential between the lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate within local areas with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of demand for raw materials that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
changes in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have an immediate effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  therefore  the resulting impact on pine sawtimber prices will usually lag in timing and be less volatile than the market for lumber 
this trend would also be true in the short term during times of a depressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
the company continues to manage the harvest level of its forests on a sustainable yield basis 

table of contents timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a pine timber growing platform 
deltic s approximately  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward growth corridor of little rock  arkansas  is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of hardwood bottomland acreage not suitable for the growing of pine timber  tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  or any other acreage not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
approximately  acres of non strategic hardwood bottomland were sold during additional sales of these acres will continue in and beyond as market conditions allow 
the sales of the non strategic hardwood bottomland were accomplished in conjunction with acquiring approximately  acres of pine timberland 
by utilizing tax deferring  like kind exchanges  deltic was able to minimize tax consequences and has invested or will invest timberland sale proceeds into more desirable pine timberland 
in addition to pine and hardwood timber sales  the company receives additional values of land ownership  such as revenues from hunting leases  mineral lease rentals and royalties  and land easements that have historically provided additional income to deltic s woodlands segment 
deltic currently has under lease approximately  net mineral acres in the area known as the fayetteville shale play  an unconventional natural gas reservoir in the state of arkansas now being developed 
in  the company received million in royalty payments from the defined fayetteville shale play area compared to million in the total of all royalty income  including the fayetteville shale play  in was million compared to million in even though natural gas prices on average during were less than in  the price decrease has been offset by higher production volumes due to an increased number of wells 
the ultimate benefit to deltic from these mineral leases remains speculative and unknown to the company and is contingent on the level of natural gas prices and the successful extraction and sale of natural gas from the area 
income from mineral lease rentals and hunting leases was million during  compared to million during the mills segment results continued to be affected by sluggish housing and lumber markets  which have resulted in a percent decline in average lumber prices over the last three years 
the segment s average lumber sales price declined ten percent when compared to lumber sales volume decreased nine percent compared to  as the company balanced lumber production with market demand 
recent detailed data on housing starts  new home sales  and the level of home inventories indicates a modest upward trend in the housing market  which may result in increased demand and higher prices for the company s commodity softwood lumber products 
as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future  and management will respond with timely decisions to take advantage of the market supply and demand situations 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
the company has achieved improved production efficiencies at both of its sawmills  largely as a result of an intensive capital upgrade program from to this improvement has been more significant at the ola mill  as the upgrade program there has focused on maximizing hourly productivity rates with the smaller log size available as raw material for the mill 
deltic will continue to seek opportunities that will enable it to increase operating efficiencies  while reducing controllable cost 
the current economic uncertainty and housing market declines have contributed to lower demand for residential lots as evidenced by sales of lots  fewer than in the average sales price for residential lots sold in was  which was a decrease of six percent when compared to  due to the current year sales mix 
deltic s lot development plans are designed to provide for lot availability in many price ranges to fulfill the planned community program 
deltic opened new residential lots 
table of contents during to maintain an appropriate mix of lot offerings 
at december   developed but uncommitted residential lots in chenal valley  red oak ridge  and chenal down were   and  respectively 
the company continues to focus on the long term financial returns from the total build out of the chenal valley development  and deems the recent negative trends to reflect anticipated fluctuations  which will have minimal impact on the overall real estate business model

future pricing trends for commercial real estate sales are difficult to predict and are influenced by multiple factors  which include intended use of the site and property location and acres 
red oak ridge includes a small amount of commercial property  depending upon actual final land usages 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal down development 
a tabular summary of deltic s commercial real estate activity is as follows commercial acres acres sold in acres sold since inception acres remaining estimated total acres development market chenal valley little rock deltic real estate activities primarily involve residential lots and commercial acreage  however  the company has constructed a small number of speculative homes in the red oak ridge development to serve as a catalyst for increasing lots sales activity 

table of contents a tabular summary of deltic s speculative home activity is as follows development market homes sold in homes constructed since inception homes sold since inception homes unsold red oak ridge hot springs operating results for del tin fiber are affected by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
del tin continued to operate at a profitable level during  although the market weakened during the fourth quarter 
the demand for thin board  used in laminate flooring  weakened  forcing del tin to realign its product mix to meet changing demands 
this realignment had a negative effect on the average sales price of mdf sold 
del tin will continue to concentrate on improving hourly production rates and plant operating efficiencies  while continuing to make reductions to the plant s cost structure where possible 
in may of  the tree act was enacted to provide a reduced federal income tax rate on timber gains 
under the provisions of this act  gains on qualified timber sales had the potential to be taxed at a percent alternate rate for corporations 
this provision was adopted for one year and expired on may  deltic s effective tax rate for reflects the effects of this temporary reduction in tax rates during the prorated portion of significant events on october   deltic delivered a notice of voluntary prepayment to all participants in the million note purchase agreement dated december   as amended 
in the agreement  the company requested that the note purchasers waive any prepayment penalty or other requirement to pay any make whole fees 
all participants except modern woodmen of america accepted the terms on october  as a result  million of the million notes were paid in full on november   and cancelled 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with metropolitan life and a group of other domestic insurance companies to amend the existing note agreement of the  private placement senior notes

on august   deltic amended its revolving credit agreement with sun trust bank and other banks whereby the unsecured and committed revolving credit facility was increased from million to million 
an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments from million to million was reinstated 
the agreement  which was set to expire on september   was extended to september  the funds available through this agreement will enable the company to take full advantage of value added growth opportunities as they present themselves 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with american agcredit pca to amend and restate the terms of the company s series a senior notes notes in the principal amount of million 
under the new agreement  the notes are due and payable december  prior to the agreement  the notes would have become due on december   pursuant to a note purchase agreement effective december  the interest rate for the notes remains the same as under the agreement percent through december   and after that date  the rate was reduced to percent for the balance of the term of the notes

under the new credit agreement  the lenders  on september   loaned del tin fiber million which was paid in full in the third quarter of  and issued on del tin fiber s behalf  a letter of credit in the amount of million to support the remaining industrial revenue bonds originally issued in by union county  arkansas 
concurrent with this event  on august   deltic executed a guarantee agreement in connection with the refinancing of the debt of del tin fiber 
under deltic s guarantee agreement  deltic unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of percent million at december  of del tin fiber s obligations under its credit agreement 
deltic considers the current status of the payment performance risk of this guarantee to be low based on history and the length of time remaining on the guarantee 
the company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover the majority of its employees 
the plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary 
deltic also has other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its employees

table of contents outlook deltic s management believes that cash provided from its operations  the remaining amount available under its credit facility  and its ability to access the credit markets  will be sufficient to meet its expected cash needs and planned expenditures  including those of the company s continued timberland acquisition and stock repurchase programs  and capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 
the preceding discussion of the company s liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements which were made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy  new and existing housing inventories  lending restrictions  and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does consider  on occasion  the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates  however  the company entered into no such instruments during the three year period ended december  deltic held various financial instruments at december  and  consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets and off balance sheet exposures resulting from contractual debt guarantees and letters of credit issued for the benefit of deltic  primarily in connection with its purchased stumpage procurement and real estate operations 
for additional information regarding these financial instruments  refer to the previous tabular summary of the company s other commercial commitment expirations and to note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  and letters of credit at december  were million  and 
million  respectively 

table of contents a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million  while the fair value of contractual guarantees and the company s letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk 
equity security price risk none of the company s financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk 
the preceding discussion of the company s estimated fair value of its financial instruments and the sensitivity analyses resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve uncertainties 
these forward looking market risk disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact deltic s business as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity security prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified seven of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s three development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf courses at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a 
table of contents reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent professional engineering consultants 
independent appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
deltic s investment in real estate held for development and sale primarily consists of residential lots  commercial tracts  and undeveloped acreage marketed to others for further development 
deltic periodically evaluates its holdings for indications of conditions that would lead to an impairment analysis as required by accounting for subsequent measurement of property  plant  and equipment 
our investment in real estate is mainly comprised of former legacy timberland and thus has a low cost basis 
margins on deltic s residential real estate average  while commercial real estate margins are 
the central arkansas area  where deltic s developments are located has one of the strongest housing markets in the country  therefore  deltic has not and does not plan to reduce the current pricing structure for its real estate 
based on these factors  the company does not foresee impairment losses in its real estate held for development or sale 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of del tin fiber s undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of equity method accounting for investments in partnerships  unincorporated joint ventures  and limited liability companies 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes timberland  fee timber  purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  are stated at cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost 
the cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs  which includes site preparation  seedlings  and labor 
the cost of fee timber harvested is 
table of contents based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
fee timber carrying costs  commercial thinning  silviculture and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred 
the company classifies its timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non strategic 
strategic timberland including pine forest and pine plantations are prime pine sawtimber growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the company sawmill s operating regions 
deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and quality of its pine sawtimber 
the company harvests sawtimber and pulpwood in accordance with its harvest plans and generally converts sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pulpwood in the market 
upon harvest  strategic timberlands are reforested 
the company s timberland acquisition program is focused on the acquisition of timberland in its current operating regions 
the company considers the acquisition and the occasional sale of strategic timberlands as investing activities 
the company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which cannot be harvested for conversion in company sawmills  reforested as pine plantations  or both 
these legacy timberlands have been identified as non strategic and or higher and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time 
the woodlands segment manages an annual program to sell a portion of these non strategic timberlands and or harvest hardwoods for the sale to third parties 
the company considers this program as an operating activity of its woodlands segment 
in order to acquire and sell assets  primarily timberlands  in a tax efficient manner  the company enters into like kind exchange lke tax deferred transactions 
the company generally enters into forward transactions  in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property  and reverse transactions  in which property is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold 
a qualified lke intermediary is used to facilitate lke transactions 
proceeds from forward lke transactions are held by the intermediary and are classified as restricted cash because the funds must be reinvested in similar properties 
if the acquisition of suitable lke properties is not completed within days of the sale of the company owned property  the proceeds are distributed to deltic by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash and applicable income taxes are determined 
amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in other investments and non current receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing activity in funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flow 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of proceeds from land sales deposited with a lke intermediary 
an exchange accommodation titleholder  a type of variable interest entity  is used to facilitate reverse like kind exchanges 
the acquired assets are held by the exchange accommodation titleholder until the exchange transactions are complete 
if the company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the exchange accommodation titleholder  deltic includes the assets held by the exchange accommodation titleholder in timber and timberlands assets on the consolidated balance sheet and recognizes any income or expense attributed to the property in the consolidated income statement 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine 
table of contents sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been 
million more in  
million less in  and the same in  
million  
million  and zero  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the recognized cost of fee timber harvested is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
assets used in a business shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the asset 
impairment recognition and measurement would occur at the lowest level for which we have identifiable cash flows 
at december   the composite basis in fee timber is per ton assuming no future growth 
gross margin on pine sawtimber for  when the average sales price was per ton  was 
a harvest cycle  which ranges between and years would be used to evaluate the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
due to the long life and low basis  the company does not expect to incur impairment loss in the future for its timber and timberlands 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management also evaluates any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations 
for additional information about the company s property  plant  and equipment  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation on january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions for share based payment transactions 
under the fair value recognition provisions for share based payments  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
for the valuation of stock options  deltic elected to use a binomial model to estimate fair value 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date 
table of contents of grant 
for restricted stock performance units  the monte carlo simulation is used to estimate fair value 
the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the company s total stockholder return compared to the total return of a paper and forest products index the index selected by the compensation committee and calculated by standard and poor s 
determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgement  including forecasting future financial results 
this estimate may be revised periodically due to changes in awards 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
the company uses historical volatility over the ten year trading life of its stock to determine volatility assumptions 
risk free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected dividend yield is based on the company s average dividend yield from to the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected option term is based on the term of the option and historical exercise  and expiration experience 
assumptions for the   and valuation of stock options and restricted stock performance units consisted of the following weighted expected volatility dividend yield expected term of options in years risk free interest rate options risk free interest rate restricted stock revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board fob shipping point 
revenue from the sale of timber cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser  which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber 
revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested 
such intersegment sales  which are made at prices which generally approximate market  are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist 
deltic s management periodically evaluates the company s ability to realize future benefit of deferred tax assets by reviewing the expected turnaround of deferred tax liabilities and the amount of future taxable income and by evaluating tax planning strategies that could possibly be implemented to realize deferred tax assets 
the company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in its tax return 
these liabilities are estimated based on judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances 
changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change 
related party transactions the company has committed to provide to del tin fiber a portion of the plant s fiber and wood supply at market prices 
this arrangement benefits del tin fiber by ensuring a portion of its raw material needs while providing the company with a purchaser of residual by products produced by its lumber mills  if needed 
the market price that deltic receives for these transactions is determined by the average price paid during the immediate preceding year by del tin fiber to other suppliers of the products purchased from the company 
during   and  deltic sold del tin fiber approximately million  million  and million each year  respectively  of these residual by products
