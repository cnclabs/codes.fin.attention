item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail consumers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floor plan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail consumers  providing our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to optimize operating results and reduce risk in the event of a further downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly when deemed appropriate  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  monitoring the activities and financial condition of the third party floor plan lenders who finance our dealers inventories and of our dealers  maximizing stockholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to stockholders  and the repurchase of the company s common stock on the open market  and aligning the interests of our management and stockholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our historical and forecasted financial results  market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
during  the industry continued the trend of lower wholesale and retail sales that began in the fourth quarter of high fuel prices and the problems in the residential mortgage market which came to light in had a continuing impact on both consumer confidence as a whole  as well as consumer spending decisions in popular boating areas such as florida and southern california 
in addition  the financial crisis which intensified in late and continued through reduced the availability of floor plan credit for our dealers  which in turn reduced their capacity to accept deliveries of new products from us 
the company believes that the current boating cycle has reached a trough  but there are no near term catalysts which will improve the retail selling environment for our products 
however  as a result of our prior curtailment of production  our dealer inventories have reached historically low levels 
as a result  we have increased production during the fourth quarter of in order to meet dealer and expected retail demand for new models 
during  the weak financial condition of a number of our dealers  combined with the lack of availability of floor plan lending  required us to assist our dealers in the liquidation of their inventory of non current models 
this financial support negatively impacted our financial results during  but we do not believe that there will be any additional impact on our financial results from further financial support of our dealer network to liquidate non current models 
however  management will continue to monitor dealer inventory levels and the risk of additional dealer defaults and resulting repurchase obligations 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  an increase from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this increase was concentrated in the larger to foot size boats in our market 
we believe this was the result of two factors the execution of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats  and the strategy of certain of our competitors  who have built and sold a large number of entry level smaller boats which are constructed in offshore manufacturing plants with lower cost labor 
although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that net sales will increase in compared to and that our operating results will improve 
this belief is based on indications that the downturn in recreational boating has ended  and the fact that our dealer inventories are at historically low levels 
while retail demand may not increase significantly in  our production and sales to dealers will increase because retail demand will have to be fulfilled by production from our manufacturing plants rather than by sales of dealer inventory to retail consumers 
early indications from winter boat shows are that attendance and sales are equal to  or slightly higher than  our operating results should improve due to an improved gross margin from increased production and significantly lower incentive costs 
in addition  the availability of credit from third party floor plan lenders who provide inventory financing to the vast majority of our dealers has improved for financially stable dealers 
also  the prolonged drought in several of marine products major southeastern markets is over  which enhances the navigability of waterways as well as access to docks  boat ramps and other recreational facilities 
however  we do not believe that retail sales will increase significantly in due to the prolonged recession and continued weak consumer confidence  which will dampen the enthusiasm for purchases of large discretionary items such as pleasure boats 
in addition  consumer credit remains tight and fuel prices are somewhat higher than at this time last year 
in addition  the current financial crisis may have long term effects on consumer behavior with regard to pleasure boating 
current and potential future lower returns on financial assets may force consumers to delay retirement  or to choose more modest lifestyles when they do retire 
in such a case  consumers may not purchase boats  may purchase boats later in their lives  or may purchase smaller  less expensive boats 
over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have been improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
in addition  the recreational boating industry began a promotional program several years ago which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts  as well as other activities designed to increase the potential consumer market for pleasure boats 
many manufacturers  including marine products  are participating in this program 
management believes that these efforts will benefit the industry and marine products 
we have implemented a marketing program for potential new dealers which emphasizes our financial strength and product quality as an alternative to many competitors who are less financially stable and less able to support their dealers with quality products and good service 
during we gained a number of new dealers who had previously sold competitors products  which served to offset the number of our dealers who exited the business due to bankruptcy or for other reasons 
as in past years  marine products enhanced the design of a number of its product lines for the model year which began on july  for this model year  marine products is emphasizing fewer models with more standard features and fewer options  which will allow dealers with limited financial resources to reduce the quantity of inventory which they are required to carry 
our financial results in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  consumer confidence  the availability of credit to our dealers and consumers  fuel costs  the continued acceptance of our new products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials 
we anticipate that the company will continue to be challenged by the effect of an uncertain level of consumer demand during the winter boat show and retail selling seasons

the company participates in a multiple employer retirement income plan  sponsored by rpc  inc rpc 
we expect that additional contributions to the retirement income plan of approximately  will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
on april   the board of directors voted to suspend the quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders 
the company has agreements with two employees  which provide for a monthly payment to the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
on january   the board of directors authorized an additional  shares that the company may repurchase for a total aggregate authorization of  shares 
as of december   the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market under this program and there are  shares that remain available for repurchase 
the company did not repurchase any shares under this program during the company has entered into agreements with third party floor plan lenders where it has agreed  in the event of default by the dealer  to repurchase mpc boats repossessed from the dealer 
these arrangements are subject to maximum repurchase amounts and the associated risk is mitigated by the value of the boats repurchased 
the company incurred obligations for inventory repurchases totaling approximately million during resulting from dealer defaults on floor plan financing 
as of december   there were no payables due to lenders related to repurchased inventory 
there are no repurchased boats remaining in inventory as of december  as all of these boats have been redistributed among existing and replacement dealers 
if additional dealers experience financial difficulty as a result of the current market conditions  the company may incur additional repurchase obligations under current programs or programs initiated in the future for the model year 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations due to floor plan lenders other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for warehouse space and various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
the company has agreements with various third party lenders where it guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
as of december   there are no payables outstanding to floor plan lenders 
additionally  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties was  as of december  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters 
fair value measurements the company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy level  or based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as level the company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as level for defined benefit plan assets classified as level  the values are computed using inputs such as cost  discounted future cash flows  independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculated by the fund and not publicly available 
in  the company transferred trading securities from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs because significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices were used to value these trading securities 
also in  due to market disruptions that led to decreased availability of quoted prices for identical assets  the company classified available for sale securities  consisting primarily of municipal bonds  from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various third party floor plan lenders whereby the company guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
the company s obligation under these guarantees becomes effective in the case of a default under the financing arrangement between the dealer and the third party lender 
the agreements provide for the return of all repossessed boats in new and unused condition subject to normal wear and tear  as defined  to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on those boats  up to certain contractually determined dollar limits which vary by lender 
during  mpc became contractually obligated to repurchase inventory of approximately million as a result of dealer defaults  none of which remains outstanding as of december  all of these repossessed boats have been redistributed among existing and replacement dealers 
management continues to monitor the risk of additional defaults and resulting repurchase obligation based primarily upon information provided by the third party floor plan lenders and will adjust the guarantee liability at the end of each reporting period based on information reasonably available at that time 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  an amendment to the current agreement with one of the company s lenders was executed with a contractual repurchase limit of million effective january  which will expire june  the company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation of approximately million with expiration dates from june  to december  as of december   the company had an aggregate remaining repurchase obligation of million with these financing institutions  although in certain situations  the company may decide for business reasons to repurchase boats in excess of these contractual amounts 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in  and  in the company s liability to rpc for these services as of december  and was approximately  and  the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the company s executive officers with the exception of one are employees of both the company and rpc 
the employee benefits agreement provides for  among other things  the company s employees to continue participating subsequent to the spin off in two rpc sponsored benefit plans  specifically  the defined contribution k plan and the defined benefit retirement income plan

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although historically very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends and management estimates  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are primarily based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives recorded in net sales as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in  and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating loss by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and the company s enforcement of those terms over time  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on several factors including the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent in  and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales increased in compared to due primarily to approximately million in additional warranty expense recognized during relating to the unusually high number of claims associated with prior model year boats sold at retail requiring unanticipated repair costs 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately  income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which the earnings and deductions are realized  variations in the relationship of tax exempt income or losses to income before taxes and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  the effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed 
the company considers future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
the company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marine products holds no derivative financial instruments which could expose marine products to significant market risk 
marine products maintains an investment portfolio  comprised primarily of municipal debt and corporate debt securities  which are subject to interest rate risk exposure 
this risk is managed through conservative policies to invest in high quality obligations 
marine products has performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis using a duration model over the near term with a percent change in interest rates 
marine products portfolio is not subject to material interest rate risk exposure based on this analysis 
marine products does not expect any material changes in market risk exposures or how those risks are managed 
management s report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of marine products corporation the management of marine products corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 
marine products corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance  at a reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures  an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel 
this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any controls system 
a controls system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met 
also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls 
under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting  as of december  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
based on this evaluation  management s assessment is that marine products corporation s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of the material weakness related to accounting for certain dealer incentive costs as of december  a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   related to the accounting for certain dealer incentive costs 
these dealer incentive costs were improperly classified as selling  general and administrative expenses rather than as a reduction in net sales 
although the company believes that it had designed effective controls related to accounting for dealer incentive costs  the operating effectiveness of these controls was inadequate 
in order to improve the operating effectiveness of these controls  in march  the company implemented extensive and comprehensive technical accounting reviews of certain dealer incentive costs on a monthly basis 
in march  management has determined the appropriate classification of the aforementioned dealer incentive costs and believes the reinforced monitoring and review will remediate this material weakness
