item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview landauer is a leading global provider of technical and analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure and is the leading domestic provider of outsourced medical physics services 
for over years  the company has provided complete radiation dosimetry services to hospitals  medical and dental offices  universities  national laboratories  nuclear facilities and other industries in which radiation poses a potential threat to employees 
landauer s services include the manufacture of various types of radiation detection monitors  the distribution and collection of the monitors to and from customers  and the analysis and reporting of exposure findings 
these services are provided to approximately million individuals globally 
in addition to providing analytical services  the company may lease or sell dosimetry detectors and reading equipment to large customers that want to manage their own dosimetry programs  or into smaller international markets in which it is not economical to establish a direct service 
through its global physics solutions  inc gps subsidiary  which was acquired in november  the company provides therapeutic and imaging physics services to the medical physics community 
landauer s radiation monitoring business is a mature business and growth in numbers of customers is modest 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been to expand into new international markets  primarily by partnering with existing dosimetry service providers with a prominent local presence 
in addition  the company has been developing new platforms and formats for its osl technology  such as inlight r  to gain access to markets where the company previously did not have a significant presence  such as smaller in house and commercial laboratories  nuclear power facilities  tactical military monitoring and hospitals to support monitoring of patient exposure to radiation 
revenue growth in recent years has occurred as a result of entry into new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions  modest unit growth  sale of inlight equipment and badges  and new ancillary services and products 
the company believes pricing in the domestic market has become more competitive and opportunities to obtain regular price increases from its customers may be more limited in the future 
the continued economic downturn and uncertain impact of healthcare reform has resulted in increased pricing pressure with the company s healthcare customer base  which is expected to continue into the future 
on november   the company completed the acquisition of gps 
gps  with primary offices in ohio and upstate new york  has operations throughout the midwest and texas 
gps is the leading nationwide provider of medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers 
medical physics services is a large fragmented market 
market growth is expected to be driven by the utilization of radiation in the provision of healthcare  trends towards outsourcing of services in healthcare settings  and a tightening domestic supply of qualified medical physicists 
the company reports these operating results in the recently formed medical physics reporting segment 
also  in november  landauer completed the acquisition of gammadata matteknik ab gdm  a swedish provider of radon measurement services 
gdm is based near stockholm  sweden and provides measurement services throughout the scandinavian region and europe 
in october  landauer acquired a dosimetry service in sweden  now called landauer persondosimetri ab pdm 
the acquisitions of gdm and pdm are reported in the radiation monitoring reporting segment 
in june  landauer completed the acquisition of the assets of upstate medical physics  a provider of imaging physics services in upstate new york 
this acquisition is reported in the medical physics reporting segment 
results of operations in connection with the acquisition of gps  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began to operate in two reportable segments  radiation monitoring and medical physics 
historically the company operated in the radiation monitoring segment exclusively 
the company evaluates performance of the individual segments based upon  among other metrics  segment operating earnings or loss 
segment operating income or loss is segment revenue less segment cost of sales and segment selling  general and administrative expenses 
given the recent addition of the medical physics segment  the company currently does not perform allocations between the segments 
corporate expenses for shared functions  including corporate management  corporate finance and human resources  are recognized in the radiation monitoring segment where they have historically been reported 
the company anticipates that  as it progresses along the integration of transaction processing  human resources and benefits administration and business development activities  among other areas  the degree of expense allocation between the segments may change 
additional information on the company s reportable segments is contained under the footnote segment information in item of this annual report on form k 
current year segment performance is discussed with the consolidated results of operations due to the lack of comparability for the new medical physics segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or compared with revenues of million for fiscal the increase in revenue was driven by the contribution from the medical physics segment of million and growth in the radiation monitoring segment of million 
within radiation monitoring  domestic revenue increased million  with growth in inlight equipment revenue of million offset by reduced demand of million in the homebuyer s radon monitoring business due to the weakness in the housing market and declines of million in occupational monitoring services driven by the impact of the economy 
international revenue growth was million  or  driven by the contributions from gdm and pdm of million  organic growth in most regions of million  and the impact of the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the dollar of million 
the domestic inlight equipment revenue included sales to the canadian government agency responsible for occupational monitoring and radiation emergency preparedness for the citizens of canada 
in march  the company executed a multi year contract valued at approximately million  which represents an estimate of purchases over the contract term  with commitments to be established annually  subject to annual funding by the canadian government 
during fiscal  the company recognized revenue of million under the agreement  compared with million during fiscal radiation monitoring revenue included sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to nagase landauer  ltd  the company s unconsolidated joint venture in japan  of badges and services to support its fiscal transition of the japanese service market from the luxel badge to a next generation badge based upon the inlight platform 
with the completion of the transition in the third fiscal quarter of  the venture will no longer be purchasing service badges 
the reduction of historical luxel badge revenue of approximately million will be partially offset by a royalty arrangement of approximately million annually 
total cost of sales for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with cost of sales of million for fiscal the addition of the medical physics segment contributed million of the increase in cost of sales 
radiation monitoring contributed million of the increase in cost of sales primarily due to the addition of gdm and pdm 
gross margins for fiscal were of revenues  compared with in fiscal the decline in gross margin rate is primarily a result of revenue mix due to the increased contribution of lower margin medical physics revenue  which had a gross margin of 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million or  compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was driven by the addition of the medical physics segment of million  and million increase in the radiation monitoring segment 
the primary factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense for the radiation monitoring segment include million increase in international spending due to the contribution of acquired companies  gdm and pdm  and the impact of the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the dollar  and million of increased expense spending to replace the company s information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle  offset by reduced incentive compensation 
in conjunction with the acquisitions completed during fiscal  the company incurred million million  after tax of acquisition related transaction and reorganization costs 
the transaction costs of approximately million were primarily for professional fees with accounting  financial  legal and tax advisors to support the due diligence  transaction structure and accounting for the acquisitions 
in addition  the charges included million in reorganization costs for severance to support changes in selected roles within the gps organization 
on february   the board of directors approved changes to the company s retirement benefit plans to transition from a defined benefit philosophy for retirement benefits to a defined contribution approach 
the company anticipates that the redesign of its retirement plans will result in future cost savings while offering market based retirement benefits to its employees 
as a result of the changes  the company recognized million million after tax of non recurring pension curtailment and transition costs during fiscal further details are contained under the footnote net defined benefit plan curtailment loss and transition costs in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the company initiated a management reorganization plan to strengthen selected roles within the organization 
as a result  the company recognized million million after tax of non recurring reorganization charges during fiscal operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal for fiscal  the medical physics segment had an operating loss of million  and the radiation monitoring segment had operating income of million 
net other income  including equity in income of joint venture  for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with net other income of million for fiscal the decrease in net other income was due to increased interest expense on outstanding borrowings to support the acquisitions completed during the fiscal year and a decline in recognized foreign currency gains 
the effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate increased primarily due to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition costs and the elimination of certain tax credits realized in fiscal net income for the fiscal year was million  an increase of  compared with net income of million for fiscal  with resulting diluted earnings per share for the current fiscal year of  compared with reported for fiscal adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal were million  a increase compared with million reported for fiscal a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda is included below 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of compared with revenues of million for fiscal domestic revenue growth for fiscal was million  or  attributable primarily to gains in the core radiation monitoring business driven by increased pricing for certain services and increases in domestic inlight equipment revenue 
international revenue increased million  or  as a result of growth in volume in most regions  inlight equipment revenue  and the sale of inlight badges to nagase landauer  ltd 
to support its fiscal transition of the japanese service market from the luxel badge to a next generation badge based upon the inlight platform 
the impact of the strengthening of the dollar against most foreign currencies reduced revenue by approximately million 
as disclosed above  the domestic inlight equipment sales increase was driven primarily by sales to the canadian government agency responsible for occupational monitoring and radiation emergency preparedness for the citizens of canada 
during fiscal  the company recognized revenue of approximately million from this customer  compared with approximately million in fiscal the company recorded deferred revenue of million under the contract as of september  total cost of sales for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with cost of sales of million for fiscal  due to increased cost of materials to support growth in inlight product sales 
gross margins for fiscal were of revenues  compared with in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million or  compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal factors contributing to the increase included million for increased incentive compensation costs and higher salary and benefits related to staff additions  million of increased professional fees related primarily to international patent and trademark activities  and million of increased expense spending to replace the company s information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
as a result of changes to the company s retirement benefit plans  previously disclosed herein  the company recognized million million after tax of non recurring pension curtailment and transition costs during the second fiscal quarter of also as disclosed above  the company initiated a management reorganization plan to strengthen selected roles within the organization

net other income  including equity in income of joint venture  for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with net other income of million for fiscal the decrease in net other income was due to lower interest and investment income as a result of declines in market rates  substantially offset by increased nagase landauer  ltd 
equity earnings  favorably impacted by foreign exchange  during fiscal the effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the reduction was due primarily to a change in the state tax rate driven by changes in the illinois state tax law effective for fiscal additional benefits were realized from the reduction of state tax reserves related to the filing of voluntary disclosures in certain states and the tax benefit of funding the frozen pension plan 
net income for the fiscal year was million  an increase of  compared with net income of million for fiscal  with resulting diluted earnings per share for the current year of  compared with reported a year ago 
the fiscal net income increase was minimized by the effect of the pension curtailment and transition costs and the reorganization charges  in the amount of million  or per diluted share 
fourth quarter results of operations revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of were million  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the fourth fiscal quarter of the increase in revenue was driven by the contribution from the medical physics segment of million and growth in the radiation monitoring segment of million 
within radiation monitoring  domestic revenue increased million  or  driven primarily by inlight product growth 
international revenue growth was million  or  driven by the contributions from gdm and pdm of million and organic growth in most regions  offset by the impact of the weakening of most foreign currencies against the dollar 
cost of sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal the addition of the medical physics segment contributed million of the increase in cost of sales 
gross margins for the fourth quarter of fiscal were of revenues  compared with in fiscal the decline in gross margin rate is primarily a result of revenue mix due to the increased contribution of lower margin medical physics revenue  which had a gross margin of in the quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared with expense of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was driven by the addition of the medical physics segment of million  offset partially by a decline of million in the radiation monitoring segment 
the company incurred million of acquisition and related costs during the fourth fiscal quarter of for severance to support changes in selected roles within the gps organization 
operating income for the fourth fiscal quarter of was million  a decrease of million compared with million in the fourth fiscal quarter of for the fiscal fourth quarter  the medical physics segment had an operating loss of million and the radiation monitoring segment had operating income of million 
net other income for the fourth quarter decreased by million to million in fiscal reflecting primarily increased interest expense on outstanding borrowings 
the effective tax rate was and  in the fiscal fourth quarter of and  respectively 
the fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate increased primarily due to the elimination of certain tax credits realized in fiscal net income for the fiscal fourth quarter of was million  compared with net income of million for fourth quarter fiscal  with resulting diluted earnings per share for the quarter of compared with reported in the fiscal fourth quarter of outlook for fiscal landauer s current business plan for fiscal anticipates consolidated net revenue for the year to be in the range of to million  including to million in sales to the u 
s military and first responder markets 
military and first responder market sales are dependent on military and other governmental appropriations and approvals which have yet to be obtained 
the business plan anticipates spending of to million  with to million of expense spending to support the successful completion of the company s systems initiative and the related post implementation support 
based upon the above assumptions  the company anticipates reported net income for fiscal in the range of to million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash decreased million during fiscal to end the year with million in cash on hand 
cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the decline in operating cash flow was driven primarily by the use of cash for the increase in prepaid taxes and the decline in deferred contracts offset by the reduction in funding in long term pension and postretirement obligations in fiscal investing activities included million in fiscal for the company s acquisitions  as described under the footnote business combinations in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the company had acquisitions of property  plant and equipment in the amounts of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the fiscal year  the company initiated a project to replace its information technology systems 
the project has extended beyond its initial timeline and planned costs due to increased customization of the software to capture the unique business requirements of the company

the amendment  among other changes to the original terms  extended the maturity date to june  and increased the aggregate amount of funds available to million subject  with respect to amounts borrowed in excess of million  to certain criteria outlined in the credit agreement 
in february  the company executed a second amendment to its loan agreement 
the second amendment  among other changes to the original terms  extended the maturity date to february   added global physics solutions  inc as a borrower  added a prepayment penalty equal to should the company voluntarily terminate the facility prior to february   and modified the interest rate on outstanding amounts from either libor plus or the bank s prime rate plus to either libor plus or the bank s prime rate minus 
effective october   the company executed a third amendment to its loan agreement 
the third amendment  among other changes  increased the aggregate amount of funds available to the company to million  subject  with respect to amounts borrowed in excess of million to a borrowing base test  extended the maturity date to october   modified the manner in which the interest rate on outstanding amounts would be determined  and extended the applicable date of the prepayment penalty such that the penalty would be due if the company should voluntarily terminate the facility prior to october  the company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  as calculated pursuant to the terms of the first amendment to the credit agreement  as of the end of each calendar quarter of not less than to  and a funded debt to ebitda ratio less than or equal to to 
as of september   the fixed charge coverage ratio was approximately  and the company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement 
the debt is classified as current as the agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause as well as a company elected arrangement which provides for automatic draws or pay downs on the credit facility on a daily basis after taking into account operating cash needs

from time to time  the company may have the opportunity to make investments for acquisitions or other purposes  and borrowings can be made under the current credit facility to fund such investments 
landauer requires limited working capital for its operations since many of its customers pay for services in advance 
such advance payments  reflected on the balance sheets as deferred contract revenue  amounted to million and million  respectively  as of september  and while these amounts represent approximately and of current liabilities  respectively  as of september  and  such amounts generally do not represent a future cash obligation 
customers are invoiced primarily in accordance with the company s standard terms  with payment due thirty days from date of invoice 
landauer also offers radiation monitoring services in australia  brazil  canada  china  france  japan  mexico  sweden and the united kingdom 
the company s operations in these markets generally do not depend on significant capital 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the reporting currency 
the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates is not material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
use of non gaap financial measures in evaluating the company s financial performance and outlook  management uses adjusted ebitda 
adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is a non gaap measure 
management believes that such measure supplements evaluations using operating income  net income  and diluted earnings per share and other gaap measures  and is a useful indicator for investors 
this indicator can help readers gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects without the effect of non cash or other one time items and the company s ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes  capital expenditures  and debt repayment 
investors should recognize that these non gaap measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  any measure of performance  cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

the debt is classified as current as the agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause as well as a company elected arrangement which provides for automatic draws or pay downs on the credit facility on a daily basis after taking into account operating cash needs 
based on current business plans and projected operating cash flows  the company anticipates continued usage of the revolving facility beyond the next twelve months 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of the payments or the amount by which its gross unrecognized tax benefits of million will be settled

further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes in item of this annual report on form k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved amended guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie 
the guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether a company s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
a company would be required to assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
in addition  on going reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in vies are required 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after november  the company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb approved the issuance of new guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the new guidance will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics and will often result in earlier revenue recognition 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under the new guidance 
the new guidance for arrangements that include software elements removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  resulting in the recognition of revenue similar to that for other tangible products 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively 
the company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance to improve the disclosures that a company provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  a company is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for landauer for its fiscal first quarter ending december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for landauer beginning with its fiscal second quarter ending march  the new guidance impacts only financial statement disclosures  and  therefore  will not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective october   the company adopted guidance that amends the accounting for business combinations  and the accounting and reporting for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
the amended guidance aims to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for and reporting of business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the company applied the amended guidance for business combinations to its fiscal acquisitions 
additional disclosures regarding the business combinations are contained under the footnote business combinations in item of this annual report on form k 
upon adoption of the guidance for a noncontrolling interest  the company reclassified amounts formerly presented as minority interest to noncontrolling interest as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of income 
inflation the company strives to reflect the inflationary impact of materials  labor and other operating costs and expenses in its prices 
the market for the services and products that the company offers  however  is highly competitive  and in some cases has limited the ability of the company to offset inflationary cost increases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make assumptions and estimates that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements as well as related disclosures 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
below are the critical accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the source of radiation monitoring segment revenues for the company is radiation measuring and monitoring services including other services incidental to measuring and monitoring 
the measuring and monitoring services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business in the radiation monitoring segment as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly  quarterly  semi annually or annually that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the company  through its medical physics segment  offers full scope medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers 
services offered include  but are not limited to  clinical physics support in radiation oncology  commissioning services  special projects support and imaging physics services 
delivery of the medical physics services can be of a contracted  recurring nature or as a discrete project with a defined service outcome 
recurring services often are provided on the customer s premises by a full time employee or fraction of a full time employee 
these services are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
fee for service projects revenue is recognized when the service is delivered 
contracted services are billed on an agreed upon recurring basis  either in advance or arrears of the service being delivered 
customers may be billed monthly  quarterly  or at some other regular interval over the contracted period 
the amounts recorded as deferred revenue represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service 
management believes that the amount of deferred contract revenue fairly represents remaining business activity with customers invoiced in advance 
fee for service revenue is typically associated with much shorter contract periods  or with discrete individual projects 
invoicing is usually done after completion of the project and customer acceptance thereof 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to million and million  respectively  as of september  and property  plant equipment and other assets maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  five to eight years for internal software and thirty months to eight years for other assets 
the company assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
the company capitalizes costs of software which is acquired  internally developed  or modified solely to meet the company s internal needs 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage as well as training costs and maintenance costs during the postimplementation operation stage are expensed 
capitalized costs of software amounted to million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and in fiscal  million of the capitalized software costs was related to the company s initiative to replace various business processes and replace components of its information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents  trademarks  tradenames and goodwill 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe  sapra landauer and gps as well as other smaller investments 
goodwill as well as trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives 
fasb authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
reporting units are business components one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
per guidance  two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics and are economically interdependent  among other factors 
as a result of this aggregation  the company has two reporting units  radiation monitoring and medical physics 
the company performs an impairment test for each of its reporting units with goodwill annually and  for goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include  but are not limited to  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a product  technology  or service introduced by a competitor  or a loss of key personnel 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company performs a financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by asset or asset group 
impairment testing is performed in two steps 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  the company compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit  step two of the test would be performed to determine the amount of impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow analysis establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from a reporting unit over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon 
a range of discount rates and perpetuity growth rates is considered 
to further substantiate the estimated fair value  the company compares the aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its market capitalization
