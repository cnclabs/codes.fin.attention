item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of surgical and non surgical products for the spine  orthopedics  sports medicine and vascular market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are invasive and minimally invasive spinal implant products and related human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  non invasive bone growth stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  bone cement and devices for removal of bone cement used to fix artificial implants and airway management products used in anesthesia applications 
in  our publicly stated financial goals were primarily related to improvements in the operating performance of the spinal implants biologics segment  including an acceleration in the growth of revenue  an increase of the gross profit margin  and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales the acceleration of revenue growth was driven by the introduction of a number of key new products in  including the trinity evolution allograft  the firebird pedicle screw system  the pillar sa interbody device  and the ascent le posterior cervical spine system 
our gross profit margin increased as a result of the introduction of the key new products indicated above  primarily trinity evolution 
while we record of the sales price of trinity evolution allograft versus recording of the sales price of the old trinity product  we recognize a gross profit margin from the marketing fees earned from the sales of this allograft  compared to approximately gross profit margin on our previous trinity product 
this is due to the fact that we are not required to purchase inventory of trinity evolution  whereas  previously  we were required to purchase inventory of the old trinity product and record the associated cost of sales 
our operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales as we leveraged our operating infrastructure against the increase in net sales noted above 
additionally  we initiated a reorganization and consolidation plan  during the fourth quarter of  to reduce operating expenses by eliminating redundancies and increasing operating efficiency 
this plan includes the consolidation of operations in our springfield  ma and wayne  nj locations into the company s operations in the dallas  tx area 
for a further discussion about this reorganization and consolidation plan  please refer to the explanation provided in our liquidity and capital resources section of this management discussion and analysis 
we have administrative and training facilities in the us and italy and manufacturing facilities in the us  the united kingdom  italy and mexico 
we directly distribute our products in the us  the united kingdom  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico  brazil  and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
however  sales associated with products for elective procedures appear to be influenced by the somewhat lower level of such procedures performed in the late summer 
certain of the breg bracing products experience greater demand in the fall and winter corresponding with high school and college football schedules and winter sports 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar denominated income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our operations as four business segments domestic  spinal implants biologics  breg  and international 
domestic consists of operations of our subsidiary orthofix inc spinal implants and biologics consist of our blackstone subsidiary and its domestic and international operations 
breg consists of breg inc s operations and domestic and international distributors 
international consists of operations which are located in the rest of the world as well as independent export distribution operations 
group activities are comprised of the operating expenses and identifiable assets of orthofix international nv and its nv holding company subsidiary  orthofix holdings  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  derivatives and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized as income in the period in which title passes and the products are delivered 
revenues exclude any value added or other local taxes  intercompany sales and trade discounts 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
royalty revenues are recognized when the royalty is earned 
for bone growth stimulation and certain bracing products that are prescribed by a physician  the company recognizes revenue when the product is placed on or implanted in and accepted by the patient 
for domestic spinal implant and hct p products  revenues are recognized when the product has been utilized and a confirming purchase order has been received from the hospital 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify that title passes on delivery 
revenues for inventory delivered on consignment are recognized as the product is used by the consignee 

table of contents in  the company entered into an agreement with the musculoskeletal transplant foundation mtf to develop and commercialize a new stem cell based bone growth biologic matrix 
with the development process completed in  the company and mtf operate under the terms of a separate commercialization agreement 
under the terms of this year agreement  mtf sources the tissue  processes it to create the bone growth matrix  and packages and delivers it in accordance with orders received directly from customers and from the company 
the company has exclusive global marketing rights for the new allograft and receives a marketing fee from mtf based on total sales 
this marketing fee is recorded on a net basis within net sales 
the company derives a significant amount of revenues in the us from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
certain billings are subject to review by the third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory adjustments in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment formerly known as sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets with definite lives  such as orthofix s developed technologies and distribution network assets  are tested for impairment if any adverse conditions exist or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  the company tests the intangible asset for recoverability 
for purposes of the recoverability test  the company groups its intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group  the company will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
the company generally calculates fair value of intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows the company expects to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows associated with intangible assets  the company uses estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
table of contents the company tests goodwill and certain trademarks at least annually 
the company tests more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
these indicators include  among others  declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
consistent with prior years  the company has identified four reporting units  which are consistent with the company s reporting segments  domestic  spinal implants and biologics  breg and international 
in performing the annual impairment test  the company utilizes the two step approach prescribed under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other formerly known as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of each reporting unit s carrying value to the fair value of the respective unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
carrying value in order to calculate the respective carrying values  the company records goodwill based on the purchase price allocation performed at the time of acquisition 
corporate assets and liabilities that directly relate to a reporting unit s operations are ascribed directly to that reporting unit 
corporate assets and liabilities that are not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  are allocated based on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
fair value income approach the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated  entirely or predominantly  using an income based approach 
this income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow dcf  which estimates after tax cash flows on a debt free basis  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company believes the dcf generally provides the most meaningful fair value as it appropriately measures the company s income producing assets 
the company may consider using a cost approach but generally believes it is not appropriate  given the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units 
in circumstances when the dcf indicator of fair value is not sufficiently conclusive to support the carrying value of a reporting unit  or when other measures provide a more appropriate indicator  we may consider a market approach in our determination of the reporting unit s fair value 
in performing a dcf calculation  the company is required to make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates and in connection therewith considers the following the determination of expected cash flows is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts which  to the extent reasonably possible  reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
revenue growth rates represent estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions 
the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on historical margins  the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in the dcf 
this rate reflects the company s estimates for stable  perpetual growth for each reporting unit 
the discount rates are based on the reporting unit s risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  using assumptions consistent with publicly traded guideline companies operating within the medical device industry as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit 
these inputs represent the company s best estimate  however  different cash flows  growth and discount rate assumptions could generate different fair values  potentially impacting the company s impairment assessment 

table of contents domestic  breg and international reporting units the fair value of the domestic  breg and international reporting units have been established using a dcf method 
these dcf results concluded the fair value of the domestic  breg and international reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values at december  and december  the assumptions used in the december  dcf results were consistent with the dcf results used in the prior year  reflecting appropriate adjustments for changes in the economic climate 
spinal implants and biologics reporting unit during the third quarter of  the company indentified indicators of impairment with respect to the spinal implants and biologics reporting unit  prompting an interim impairment test 
the determination of the spinal implants and biologics fair value was calculated using a combination of income and market approaches  weighted based on guidance provided by an independent appraisal firm 
the income approach was based on a dcf model 
the market approach was based on the guideline transaction method  which derived applicable market multiples from the prices at which comparable companies have been acquired in the marketplace 
the company applied a weighted average percentage of  placing greater weight on the income approach  which provided a lower fair value 
this calculation resulted in a million impairment loss  reducing the related goodwill balance to million as of december  the company used a dcf to determine the fair value of the spinal implants and biologics reporting unit as of december  this resulted in no significant changes to the spinal implants and biologics fair value assumptions 
accordingly  the annual impairment test as of december  resulted in no further impairment of the spinal implants and biologics reporting unit 
derivatives we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange within the consolidated financial statements according to our hedging policy 
under the policy  we may engage in non leveraged transactions involving various financial derivative instruments to manage exposed positions 
the policy requires us to formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction 
for instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  we formally assesses both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that is used in the hedging transaction has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item and whether such derivative may be expected to remain effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be effective as a hedge  we will discontinue the related hedge accounting prospectively 
such a determination would be made when the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item  the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
we follow asc topic derivatives and hedging asc topic formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that all derivatives be recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s change in fair value ie  gains or losses is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  and subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings 
we utilize a cross currency swap to manage our foreign currency exposure related to a portion of our intercompany receivable of a us dollar functional currency subsidiary that is denominated in euro 
the cross currency swap has been accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with asc topic 
table of contents litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve a substantial number of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
as part of the total blackstone purchase price  approximately million was placed into an escrow account  against which we can make claims for reimbursement for certain defined items relating to the acquisition for which we are indemnified 
the company has certain contingencies arising from the acquisition that we expect will be reimbursable from the escrow account should we have to make a payment to a third party  including legal fees incurred related to the matter 
we believe that the amount that we will be required to pay relating to the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account  however  there can be no assurance that the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic income taxes formerly known as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  as such  we determine whether it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of each position 
at december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared with million of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and accrued interest and penalties of million and million at december  and  respectively 
share based compensation the company recognizes share based compensation in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation asc topic formerly known as sfas no 
r revised  share based payment 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted is estimated based on a number of factors  including the vesting term of the award  historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired  the expected volatility of the company s common stock and an employee s average length of service 
the risk free interest rate is determined based upon a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the compensation expense recognized for all equity based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures

the increase in domestic s net sales was partially the result of a increase in sales in our spine market sector  which was mainly driven by increased sales of our spinal stim and cervical stim products 
the increase in domestic s net sales was also attributable to a increase in our orthopedics market sector which included a increase in sales of physio stim products  an increase in sales of our external fixation products as compared to and a increase in sales of our hct p products  specifically trinity evolution

the increase in breg s net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of our breg bracing products when compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of the sales of our new products which include spine bracing 
further  sales of our cold therapy products increased in compared to which is due to the recent introduction of our kodiak cold therapy products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our pain therapy products as a result of the sale of operations related to our pain care line of ambulatory infusion pumps during march all of breg s sales are recorded in our sports medicine market sector

in october  we transitioned out of our agreement to distribute the laryngeal mask product in italy 
we will transition out of our agreement to distribute the laryngeal mask product in the united kingdom in june other product sales were and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percent of net sales in was compared to in in the year ended december   due to reduced projections in revenue  distributor terminations  new products  and the replacement of one of our products with a successor product  the company changed its estimates regarding the inventory allowance at spinal implants and biologics  primarily based on estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the change in estimate resulted in an increase in the reserve for obsolescence of approximately million 
in addition  the company recorded approximately million of expense related to spinal implants and biologics instrumentation equipment  also as a result of the replacement of one of our products with a successor product 
gross profit  excluding the additional reserve recorded at spinal implants and biologics was for the year ended december  excluding the negative impacts in the prior year  the increase in the gross profit is primarily due to the increased sales of higher margin stimulation products and spinal implants biologics products 
the gross margin in the year ended december  was unfavorably impacted by a million increase in our inventory reserve  which related primarily to the remaining supply of trinity allograft on hand at the expiration of the company s distribution agreement on june  sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense  which includes commissions  certain royalties and the bad debt provision  generally increases and decreases in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percent of sales  sales and marketing expense was and for and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an increase in sales tax expenses of million resulting from an audit that covered a period of months 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million  or  in to million compared to million in the increase is primarily due to a million restructuring charge to consolidate substantially all of blackstone s operations previously conducted in wayne  nj and springfield  ma into the same facility housing its spine stimulation and us orthopedics business in the dallas  tx area 
in addition  the company also incurred legal and other professional services associated with a proxy contest with one of the company s shareholders 
the contest was settled in a special shareholder meeting on april  as a result  the company does not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with this matter going forward 
the company also recorded an million accrual during for potential royalties payable in connection with litigation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses were also higher compared with the prior year due to infrastructure increases in some faster growing international markets

we expect to incur a milestone payment of million to iis in early and a milestone payment of million to stout medical group in see liquidity and capital resources for further detail 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased million for the year ended december  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributed to the impairment of million of definite lived intangible assets at blackstone during impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets during the year ended december   we incurred million of expense related to the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
as part of our debt refinancing completed in september  five year projections were prepared for blackstone 
these projections provided an indication of impairment 
accordingly  an interim impairment test was performed in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
based on this interim test  we determined that the blackstone trademark  an indefinite lived intangible asset  was impaired by million 
in addition  we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill related to blackstone exceeded its implied fair value  and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million 
in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment  we determined that a triggering event had occurred with respect to the definite lived intangible assets at blackstone 
we compared the expected cash flows to be generated by the definite lived intangible on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the intangible asset 
we determined the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flow and impaired the distribution network and technologies at blackstone to the fair value which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
gain on sale of pain care operations gain on sale of pain care operations was million for the year ended december  and represented the gain on the sale of operations related to our pain care line of ambulatory infusion pumps during march no such gain was recorded in the same period of interest expense  net interest expense  net was million in compared to million in included in interest expense  net for the year ended december  and was interest expense of million and million related to the senior secured term loan used to finance the blackstone acquisition 
although our overall senior secured term loan balance has decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year  our effective interest rate has increased which is generating the additional interest expense 
loss on refinancing of senior secured term loan in the year ended december   we incurred million of expense related to the refinancing of the senior secured term loan used to finance the blackstone acquisition 
this included a million non cash write off of previously capitalized debt placement costs and million of fees associated with the amendment 
we anticipated that we would not remain in compliance with certain financial covenants included in the senior secured credit facility and  consequently  negotiated an amendment of our financial covenants  among other things  with our lenders effective september  unrealized non cash gain loss on interest rate swap in june  the company entered into a three year fully amortizable interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of june  during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized in earnings an unrealized  non cash loss of approximately million when it was determined that the swap was no longer deemed highly effective 
therefore  special hedge accounting is no longer applied and mark to market adjustments are required to be reported in current earnings through the expiration of the swap in june for the year ended december   the company recorded an unrealized non cash gain of million on the consolidated statements of operations 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million in compared to million in the decrease can be mainly attributed to the effect of foreign exchange 
during the year ended december   we recorded foreign exchange losses of million principally as a result of a strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies including the euro  pound  peso and brazilian real 
several of our foreign subsidiaries hold trade payables or receivables in currencies most notably the us dollar other than their functional local currency which results in foreign exchange gains or losses when there is relative movement between those currencies 

table of contents income tax benefit expense our worldwide effective tax rate was at december  as compared to a tax benefit of as of december  the effective tax rate is impacted by a mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions  state taxes and other items 
the effective tax rate for reflected discrete items resulting from the impairment of goodwill for which we receive no tax benefit  the sale of operations related to our pain care operations and the lapse of an asc topic income taxes reserve item 
excluding these discrete items  our effective tax rate for would have been 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to  excluding discrete items  primarily relates to a benefit recorded in related to the release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations

accordingly  an interim impairment test was performed in accordance with asc topic based on this interim test  we determined that the blackstone trademark  an indefinite lived intangible asset  was impaired by million 
in addition  we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill related to blackstone exceeded its implied fair value  due to the recent trend of decreasing revenues at blackstone 
we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million 
in accordance with asc topic  we determined that a triggering event had occurred with respect to the definite lived intangible assets at blackstone

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of sales  costs of operations  and the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had a currency swap in place to minimize foreign currency exchange risk related to a million euro intercompany note 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior secured term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility if any  which bear interest at floating rates based on libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we had an interest rate swap in place as of december  to minimize interest rate risk related to our libor based borrowings 
as of december   we had million of variable rate term debt represented by borrowings under our senior secured term loan which can have a floating interest rate of libor plus a margin  with a libor floor of  or the prime rate plus a margin 
as of december   the entire term loan obligation of million is at the prime rate plus a margin of  which is adjusted based upon the credit rating of the company and its subsidiaries 
in june  we entered into a swap with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of june  the amount outstanding under the swap as of december  was million 
under the swap we will pay a fixed rate of and receive interest at floating rates based on the three month libor rate at each quarterly re pricing date until the expiration of the swap 
as of december   the effective interest rate on the debt related to the swap was 
as of december   our overall effective interest rate  including the impact of the swap  on our senior secured debt was 
based on the balance outstanding under the senior secured term loan combined with the swap as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the variable rate debt would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we are subject to cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we are subject to transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency 
as of december   we had an un hedged intercompany receivable denominated in euro of approximately million million 
we recorded a foreign currency gain during the year ended december  of million  which resulted from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during the period 
we also are subject to currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was unfavorably impacted during the year ended december  by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the strengthening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency during this period 
during the year ended december   the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency during this period 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results
