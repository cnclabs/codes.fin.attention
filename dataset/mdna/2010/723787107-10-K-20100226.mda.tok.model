mission and strategies the company s mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns through strategies that maximize pioneer s long term profitability  net asset value and net asset value per share 
the strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility and capital allocation discipline while enhancing net asset value per share through accretive drilling programs  acquisitions  debt reduction  dividend distributions and share repurchases 
these strategies are anchored by the company s long lived spraberry oil field and hugoton  raton and west panhandle gas fields  which have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of years 
underlying these fields are approximately percent of the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  business activities the company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
pioneer s purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for  develop and produce oil and gas reserves 
in so doing  the company sells homogenous oil  ngl and gas units that  except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences  cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the company s competitors 
competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well trained experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions  embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management 
petroleum industry 
beginning in the second half of and continuing throughout  the united states and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown  which led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand 
during this same time period  north american gas supply increased as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional gas production 
the combination of lower energy demand due to the economic slowdown and higher north american gas supply resulted in significant declines in oil  ngl and gas prices 
while oil and ngl prices started to steadily improve beginning in the second quarter of  gas prices remained volatile throughout due to high storage levels and increasing gas supply 
the outlook for a worldwide economic recovery in remains uncertain and  therefore  the timing of a recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict 
as a result  it is likely that commodity prices during will continue to be volatile 

table of contents for the several years preceding the economic slowdown  the petroleum industry had generally been characterized by volatile but upward trending oil  ngl and gas commodity prices 
during that period  world oil prices increased in response to increases in demand from developing economies and the perceived threat of supply disruptions in the middle east  nigeria  venezuela and other areas 
in and the first half of  oil prices increased due to supply uncertainty surrounding middle east conflicts and increasing world demand for both oil and refined products 
a significant increase in refinery outages led to tightness in products markets  which was responsible for oil price strength throughout much of and the early part of north american gas prices increased during the first half of as a result of reduced inventory levels and a perceived shortage of north american gas supply and an anticipation that the united states would become a larger importer of lng  which was selling at a substantial premium to united states gas prices in the world market 
however  by mid year it became increasingly apparent that the capital investment in gas drilling and discoveries of significant gas reserves in united states shale plays would be more than sufficient to meet the unites states demand 
coupled with the economic slowdown experienced in the second half of  the increased supply of gas resulted in a sharp decline in north american gas prices 
significant factors that the company expects to impact commodity prices include the effect of economic stimulus initiatives being implemented in the united states and worldwide in response to the worldwide economic slowdown  developments in the issues affecting the middle east in general  demand of asian and european markets  the extent to which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas  and overall north american gas supply and demand fundamentals 
to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the company s net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value  pioneer utilizes commodity derivative contracts 
although the company has entered into derivative contracts on a large portion of its forecasted production through  a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future 
as a result  the company s internally generated cash flows would be reduced for affected periods 
significant or extended price declines could also adversely affect the amount of oil  ngl and gas that the company can produce economically 
the duration  timing and magnitude of any period of lower commodity prices cannot be predicted 
a sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows  which could negatively affect the company s liquidity  financial position and future results of operations
