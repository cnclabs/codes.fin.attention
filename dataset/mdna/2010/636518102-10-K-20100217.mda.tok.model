overview national instruments corporation we  us or our is a leading supplier of measurement and automation products that engineers and scientists use in a wide range of industries 
these industries comprise a large and diverse market for design  control and test applications 
we provide flexible application software and modular  multifunctional hardware that users combine with industry standard computers  networks and third party devices to create measurement  automation and embedded systems  which we also refer to as virtual instruments 
our approach gives customers the ability to quickly and cost effectively design  prototype and deploy unique custom defined solutions for their design  control and test application needs 
we sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of our sales in  or the key strategies that management focuses on in running our business are the following expanding our broad customer base we strive to increase our already broad customer base by serving a large market on many computer platforms  through a global marketing and distribution network 
we also seek to acquire new technologies and expertise from time to time in order to open new opportunities for our existing product portfolio 
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative  modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network 
we strive to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility across different platforms in order to preserve the customer s investment in our products 
in this time of intense global competition  we believe it is crucial that we continue to offer products with quality and reliability  and that these products provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
leveraging external and internal technology our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology  supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and by leveraging our core technologies such as custom application specific integrated circuits asics across multiple products 
we sell into test and measurement t m and industrial embedded applications in a broad range of industries and as such are subject to the economic and industry forces which drive those markets 
it has been our experience that the performance of these industries and our performance is impacted by general trends in industrial production for the global economy and by the specific performance of certain vertical markets that are intensive consumers of measurement technologies 
examples of these markets are semiconductor capital equipment  telecom  defense  aerospace  automotive and others 
in assessing our business  we consider the trends in the global purchasing managers index pmi published by jp morgan  global industrial production as well as industry reports on the specific vertical industries that we target 
starting in august  the pmi has had readings above which are indicative of expansion in the industrial global economy 
however  we believe there is still a substantial amount of uncertainty about the global industrial economic conditions 
we are unable to predict whether the current expansion cycle  as measured by the pmi  will be sustained throughout this continuing uncertainty in the global industrial economy is likely to continue to have an adverse effect on the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues and therefore harm our business and result of operations 
we distribute our software and hardware products primarily through a direct sales organization 
we also use independent distributors  oems  vars  system integrators and consultants to market our products 
we have sales offices in the us and sales offices and distributors in key international markets 
sales outside of the americas accounted for approximately  and or our revenues in  and  respectively 
the vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers local currency  which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from international sales 
see 
note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales  operating income  interest income and long lived assets 
we manufacture a substantial majority of our products at our facilities in debrecen  hungary 
additional production primarily of low volume or newly introduced products is done in austin  texas 
our product manufacturing operations can be divided into four areas electronic circuit card and module assembly  chassis and cable assembly  technical manuals and product support documentation  and software duplication 
we manufacture most of the electronic circuit card assemblies  and modules in house  although subcontractors are used from time to time 
we currently use subcontractors in asia to manufacture a significant portion of our chassis but we review these arrangements periodically 
we manufacture some of our electronic cable assemblies in house  but many assemblies are produced by subcontractors 
we primarily subcontract our software duplication  our technical manuals and product support documentation 
we believe that our long term growth and success depends on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis 
accordingly  we focus significant efforts on research and development 
we focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and developing new products that incorporate appropriate features and functionality to be competitive with respect to technology  price and performance 
our success also is dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights related to technologies used in our products 
we have engaged in litigation and where necessary  will likely engage in future litigation to protect our intellectual property rights 
in monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights  we have been and may be required to spend significant resources 
we have been profitable in every year since however  there can be no assurance that our net sales will grow or that we will remain profitable in future periods 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period due to changes in global economic conditions and a number of other factors 
as a result  we believe historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales americas europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income net foreign exchange gain loss other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales 
consolidated net sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a decrease of in compared to following an increase of in compared to the decrease in can be attributed to declines in sales volume across all regions of our business 
instrument control products which comprised approximately of our revenues for the year ended december   saw a year over year decline of 
products in the areas of virtual instrumentation and graphical system design which comprised approximately of our revenues for the year ended december   saw a year over year decline of 
revenues from our instrument control products are the most sensitive to the cycles of the global industrial economy 
for the year ended december   our order backlog increased by approximately million 
backlog is a measure of orders that were received but that had not shipped to customers at the end of the quarter 
we did not take any significant action with regard to pricing during the year ended december   and thus  the decrease in revenues is attributable to a decrease in customer orders 
the increase in net sales in  compared to can be attributed to volume growth in the areas of modular instruments  particularly rf test products  pxi  software and compactrio which performed very well in light of the industry contraction 
the increases in these areas were offset by declines in revenue from instrument control products which are the most sensitive to downturns in the global pmi

we intend to continue to expand our international operations by increasing our presence in existing markets  adding a presence in some new geographical markets and continuing the use of distributors to sell our products in some countries 
almost all sales made by our direct sales offices in the americas  outside of the us  in europe and in asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates

these decreases were offset by personnel costs related to a net headcount increase of people during for  the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel costs from the hiring of additional product development engineers as well as increases related to stock based compensation and was consistent with our plan to continue to grow our research and development capacity in line with the overall revenue growth of the company 
during  we had a net headcount increase of people in our worldwide research and development group

we expect that general and administrative expenses in future periods will fluctuate in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a decrease of in compared to following a decrease of in compared to for  the decrease is attributable to significant decreases in investment yields for high grade treasury  municipal and corporate bonds 
for  the decrease is attributable to a decrease in invested funds as well as to the rapid rate of decrease in interest rates during the second half of the primary source of interest income is from the investment of our cash and short term investments 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
net foreign exchange gain loss was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these results are attributable to movements in the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in countries where our functional currency is not the us dollar 
we recognize the local currency as the functional currency in virtually all of our international subsidiaries 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated net foreign currency balance sheet positions to protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically hedge up to of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivable or payable positions and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately days 
the gain or loss on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item net foreign exchange gain loss 
our hedging strategy reduced our foreign exchange gains by million in  reduced our foreign exchange losses by million in and reduced our foreign exchange gains by million in to protect against the change in the value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales and expenses over the next one to two years  we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our forecasted revenue and forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward and option contracts 
for forward contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges 
for purchased option contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the option contracts designated as hedges  net of the premium paid 
our foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
we purchase foreign currency forward and option contracts for up to of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies primarily in euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and hungarian forint and limit the duration of these contracts to months or less 
as a result  our hedging activities only partially address our risks from foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we do not invest in contracts for speculative purposes

provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was driven by changes in our valuation allowances  tax charges related to inter company profits and an increase in equity compensation expense as a percentage of pre tax book income

our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous financial institutions throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside of the us  however  the majority of our cash and investments that are located outside of the us are denominated in the us dollar 
most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
in some countries repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments in future years 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed 
cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the following table summarizes the proceeds and uses of cash in thousands december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year our operating activities provided million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a increase

accounts receivable decreased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of lower sales volumes during this decrease in revenue also caused our days sales outstanding to increase to days at december   compared to days at december  we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient funding or credit 
consolidated inventory balances decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns decreased to per year at december  compared to per year at december  the decrease in inventory during was driven by a reduction in our manufacturing activities in response to the decreased demand for our products 
our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon our anticipated demand for products and our need to keep sufficient inventory on hand to meet our customers demands 
we attempt to balance such considerations against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
rapid changes in industrial demand could have a significant impact on our inventory balances in future periods

for  financing activities used million which was the result of million used to repurchase our common stock and million used to pay dividends to our shareholders  offset by million received as a result of the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
from time to time our board of directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions and other factors 
under such programs  we repurchased a total of   and  shares of our common stock at weighted average prices of  and per share  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
on january   our board of directors approved a new share repurchase plan which increased the aggregate number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to repurchase from  to million 
at december   there were  shares remaining available for repurchase under this plan 
this repurchase plan does not have an expiration date 
during  we received reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options compared to the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our practice to issue restricted stock units and not stock options to eligible employees which will reduce the number of stock options available for exercise in the future 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to us 
contractual cash obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total beyond guarantees purchase obligations total commercial commitments we have commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office facilities throughout the world 
certain leases require us to pay property taxes  insurance and routine maintenance  and include escalation clauses 
as of december   we have non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million compared to million at december  rent expense under operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase obligations primarily represent purchase commitments for customized inventory and inventory components 
as of december   we had non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million over the next twelve months 
at december   we had non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million 
guarantees are related to payments of customs and foreign grants 
as of december   we have outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
as of december   we have outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments  payment of dividends to our shareholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next months 
however  we may choose or be required to raise additional funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
historically  we have not had to rely on debt  public or private  to fund our operating  financing or investing activities 
we could also choose or be required to reduce certain expenditures  such as payments of dividends or repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the industrial economy  current general economic volatility and trends in the industrial economy in various geographic regions in which we do business  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  repurchases of our common stock  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb updated fasb asc providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
this update also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
we adopted the update on april  as required and concluded it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb updated fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles fasb asc 
the update establishes the fasb standards accounting codification codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
this update is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the update on july   as required and concluded it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb updated fasb asc  revenue recognition fasb asc that amended the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments will change the application of the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb updated fasb asc  software fasb asc that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in subtopic in addition  the amendments require that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be materially different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale licensing of integrated hardware and software solutions 
independent sales of application software licenses include post contract support services 
in addition  training services are sold separately 
the products and services are generally sold under standardized licensing and sales arrangements with payment terms ranging from net days in the us to net days and up to net days in some international markets 
approximately of our product license sales include both hardware and software in the customer arrangement  with a small percentage of sales including other services 
we offer rights of return and standard warranties for product defects related to our products 
the rights of return are generally for a period of up to days after the delivery date 
the standard warranties cover periods ranging from days to three years 
we do not generally enter into contracts requiring product acceptance from the customer 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value as determined by the sales price of each element when sold separately 
when vsoe of fair value is available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangements  sales revenue is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped  using the residual method under fasb asc  with a portion of revenue recorded as deferred unearned due to applicable undelivered elements 
undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer are generally restricted to post contract support and training and education 
the amount of revenue allocated to these undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those undelivered elements 
deferred revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the service period or when the service is completed 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue is generally recognized ratably  on a straight line basis over the service period of the undelivered element  generally months or when the service is completed in accordance with the subscription method under fasb asc deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the application of fasb asc  requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of our earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
estimating allowances for sales returns the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
a provision for estimated sales returns is made by reducing recorded revenue by the amount of the allowance 
accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million at december  and  respectively 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
estimating allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories in addition to estimating an allowance for sales returns  we must also make estimates about the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we also write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million and million at december  and  respectively 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt and inventory obsolescence if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
accounting for costs of computer software we capitalize costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our products is established when the product is available for beta release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december   unamortized capitalized software development costs were million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach based on the market capitalization of the reporting unit 
our annual impairment test was performed as of february  no impairment of goodwill has been identified during the period presented 
goodwill is deductible for tax purposes in certain jurisdictions 
we have defined our operating segment based on geographic regions 
we sell our products in three geographic regions 
our sales to these regions share similar economic characteristics  similar product mix  similar customers  and similar distribution methods 
accordingly  we have elected to aggregate these three geographic regions into a single operating segment 
as we have one reporting segment  we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and  our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december   we had net goodwill of approximately million 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of certain foreign investment incentives available under hungarian law  the profit from our hungarian operation was subject to a reduced income tax rate 
this special tax status terminated on january   with the merger of our hungarian manufacturing operations with its hungarian parent company 
the tax position of our hungarian operation continued to benefit from assets created by the restructuring of our operations in hungary 
realization of these assets was based on estimated future earnings in hungary 
partial release of the valuation allowance on these assets resulted in income tax benefits of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  for the year  we expected to recognize an additional tax benefit of million related to these assets 
effective january   a new tax law in hungary provides for an enhanced deduction for the qualified research and development expenses of ni hungary software and hardware manufacturing kft 
ni hungary 
during the three months ended december   we obtained confirmation of the application of this new tax law for the qualified research and development expenses of ni hungary 
based on the application of this new tax law to the qualified research and development expense of ni hungary  we no longer expect to have sufficient future taxable income in hungary to realize the benefits of these tax assets 
as such  we recorded an income tax charge of million during the three months ended december   million of which was related to a valuation allowance on the previously recognized assets created by the restructuring and million of which was related to tax benefits from other assets that we will no longer be able to realize as a result of this change 
we do not expect to realize the tax benefit of the remaining assets created by the restructuring and therefore we have a full valuation allowance of million against those assets at december  for additional discussion about our income taxes including components of income before income taxes  our provision for income taxes charged to operations  components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  a reconciliation of income taxes at the us federal statutory rate of to our effective tax rate and other tax matters  see

loss contingencies we accrue for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  in accordance with fasb asc  contingencies fasb asc  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
we periodically evaluate available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management our international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the vast majority of our sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
net of hedging results  the change in exchange rates had the effect of decreasing our consolidated sales by million or for the year ended december   compared to if the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the us dollar  we may need to lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets which could have a material adverse effect on our gross and net profit margins 
if the local currencies in which we sell our products weaken against the us dollar and if the local sales prices cannot be raised due to competitive pressures  we will experience a deterioration of our gross and net profit margins 
since most of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the change in exchange rates had the effect of decreasing our operating expenses by million or for the year ended december   compared to currently  we are experiencing significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in many of the markets in which we do business 
this has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments and on our ability to forecast our us dollar equivalent revenues and expenses 
in the past  these dynamics have also adversely affected our revenue growth in international markets and will likely pose similar challenges in the future 
our foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  our hedging program will not eliminate all of our foreign exchange risks  particularly when market conditions experience the recent level of volatility

inventory management the marketplace for our products dictates that many of our products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  we are required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by us or our competitors of products embodying new technology 
while we adjust for excess and obsolete inventories and we monitor the valuation of our inventories  there can be no assurance that our valuation adjustments will be sufficient 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of our investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions located in many countries throughout the world 
approximately million or of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various financial institutions and million or was held in accounts outside of the us with various financial institutions 
at december   million or of our cash and cash equivalents was held in cash in various operating accounts throughout the world  and million or was held in money market accounts 
the most significant of our operating accounts was our domestic operating account which held approximately million or of our total cash and cash equivalents at a bank that carried a a rating at december  our short term investment balance is comprised of million held in our investment accounts in the us and million held in investment accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
short term debt securities available for sale included auction rate securities backed by education loan revenue bonds 
one of our auction rate securities is from the vermont student assistance corporation and has a par value of million 
the other of our auction rate securities is from the new hampshire health and education facilities authority and has a par value of million 
at december   we reported these auction rate securities at their estimated fair market value of million as a component of short term debt securities available for sale 
we are also a party to a ubs auction rate securities rights the rights agreement 
the rights agreement is a nontransferable right to sell our auction rate securities  at par value  back to ubs at any time during the period june   through july  at december   we reported the rights agreement at its estimated fair market value of  as a component of short term debt securities available for sale 
see 
note fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our auction rate securities and our rights agreement 
due to the fact that our rights agreement has an initial exercise date that is less than one year from now  we are now reporting our auction rate securities and the corresponding rights agreement as short term 
we continue to have the ability to hold our auction rate securities to their ultimate maturities which are in excess of one year and we have not made a determination as to whether we will exercise our option under the rights agreement or if we do choose to exercise our option  at what point during the period june  through july   we would exercise our option 
we have recorded the unrealized loss related to the auction rate securities and the unrealized gain related to the rights agreement as a component of other income expense  in our consolidated statements of income 
we do not anticipate that the auction rate market will provide liquidity for these securities in the foreseeable future 
should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to their maturity or prior to our exercise period under the rights agreement discussed above  we may be unable to find a buyer in a secondary market outside the auction process or if a buyer in a secondary market is found  we would likely realize a loss 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of security holdings and maturities 
pursuant to fasb asc  cash equivalents and short term investments available for sale are valued using a market approach level based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets 
the estimated fair market value of both the auction rate securities and the rights agreement was determined using significant unobservable inputs level as prescribed by fasb asc the goal of our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our corporate investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
other than our auction rate securities discussed above  at december   our cash equivalents and short term investments carried ratings from the major credit rating agencies that were in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
our investment policy allows investments in the following  government and federal agency obligations  repurchase agreements repos  certificates of deposit and time deposits  corporate obligations  medium term notes and deposit notes  commercial paper including asset backed commercial paper abcp  puttable bonds  general obligation and revenue bonds  money market funds  taxable commercial paper  corporate notes bonds  municipal notes  municipal obligations  variable rate demand notes and tax exempt commercial paper 
all such instruments must carry minimum ratings of a p f  mig vmig sp and a a a  as applicable  all of which are considered investment grade 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months with at least maturing in days or less 
we account for our investments in debt and equity instruments under fasb asc our investments are classified as available for sale and accordingly are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
investments with maturities beyond one year are classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the fair value of our short term investments in debt securities at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was due to the net purchase of million of short term investments and the transfer of related to our auction rate securities and our rights agreement from long term investments to short term investments during the year ended december  the net purchase of million of short term investments was done to diversify our holdings from money market accounts to debt securities and to take advantage of higher yields associated with longer maturity debt securities 
we follow the guidance provided by fasb asc to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of income 
long term investments at december   our long term investments consisted primarily of aaa a aaa rated investments in auction rate securities that we originally purchased for million 
these auction rate securities consist of education loan revenue bonds 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are typically reset approximately every to days 
at december   we classified these investments as long term due to the fact that the underlying securities have contractual maturities that are greater than one year 
these contractual maturities are also in excess of the guidelines provided for in our corporate investment policy 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale 
at december   we reported these long term investments at their estimated fair market value of million 
in november  we accepted the rights agreement offered by ubs as a liquidity alternative to the failed auction process 
the rights agreement is a nontransferable right to sell our auction rate securities  at par value  back to ubs at any time during the period june   through july  at december   we reported the rights agreement at its estimated fair market value of million 
at december  he estimated fair market value of both the auction rate securities and the rights agreement was determined using significant unobservable inputs level as prescribed by fasb asc these auction rate securities and the rights agreement are now reported as a component of short term investments as discussed above 
interest rate risk investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment of low or declining rates will likely negatively impact our investment income 
in order to assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on our investment positions as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a  increase or decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a  increase or decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity or if there is a other than temporary impairment 
actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
economic conditions in and had negative effects on the financial markets 
in response to these conditions  we shifted a larger percentage of our portfolio to money market funds  us treasuries and time deposits toward the end of this had a negative impact on our investment income in as we noted some stabilization in the financial markets throughout  we made net purchases of million of short term investments  primarily to diversify our holdings from money market accounts to debt securities and to take advantage of higher yields associated with longer maturity debt securities 
however  yields  even at longer maturities  remained at or near historic lows throughout we cannot predict when interest rates and investment yields will rise 
if yields continue to stay at these low levels  our investment income will continue to be negatively impacted 
exchange rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  we utilize purchased foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen and hungarian forint 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures regularly to help ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchanges rates on our results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december  and december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate settlement value of all of our instruments outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  we believe that a loss in settlement value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure
