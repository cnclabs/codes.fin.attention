item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as factors described in part i  item a risk factors 
overview strategic direction of our business we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms to improve the therapeutic benefits of drugs 
our proprietary product pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas  including oncology  pain  anti infectives and immunology 
we create our innovative product candidates by using our proprietary chemistry platform to modify the chemical structure of drugs using unique polymer conjugates 
additionally  we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and the attributes of our customized polymer chemistry 
our drug candidates are designed to correct deficiencies in the pharmacokinetics  half life  oral bioavailability  metabolism or distribution of drugs to improve their therapeutic efficacy 
during  we continued to make substantial investments to advance our pipeline of drug candidates from early stage discovery research through clinical development 
on september   we entered into a license agreement with astrazeneca the astrazeneca license for the worldwide development and commercialization of nktr and nktr a co formulated product candidate including a long acting opioid and nktr 
we have several phase clinical trials for nktr pegylated irinotecan directed at a number of different indications in the oncology therapeutic area that we were advancing during and we expect to continue in in january  we announced preliminary results from stage one of the ongoing phase development program for nktr for platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients 
in february  we announced that we had dosed the first patient in a phase clinical trial for nktr pegylated docetaxel for patients with refractory solid tumors and this clinical trial is currently ongoing 
we also have other products in the early discovery research or preclinical development 
our focus on research and clinical development requires substantial investments that continue to increase as we advance each drug candidate through each phase of the development cycle 
while we believe that our strategy has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results and or receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets  drug development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are very difficult to predict 
clinical development success and failures can have an unpredictable and disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition  and market value 
we decide on a program by program basis whether we wish to continue development into phase pivotal clinical trials and commercialize products on our own  or seek a partner  or pursue a combination of these approaches 
following completion of phase development  or earlier in the development cycle in certain circumstances  we will generally be seeking collaborations with one or more biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to conduct phase clinical development  to be responsible for the regulatory approval process and  if such drug candidate is approved  to market and sell the drug in one or more global markets 
to date  we have partnered our proprietary drug development programs prior to phase clinical development 
for example  we intend to seek a collaboration partner for nktr prior to commencing any phase clinical trials for this drug candidate 
whether we ultimately enter into a collaboration agreement for nktr will depend on the partnership opportunities available to us 
the financial terms of such future collaborations  if any  including  without limitation  upfront payments  development and sales milestone payments  and royalty rates  will be critical to the future prospects of our business and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that any future collaborations will be available to us for nktr or other of our development programs  on favorable terms or at all 
we also have a number of existing license and collaboration agreements with third parties who have licensed our proprietary technologies for drugs that have either received regulatory approval in one or more markets or drug candidates that are still in the clinical development stage 
for example  the future clinical and commercial success of bayer s amikacin inhale bay or nktr  ucb s cimzia  roche s mircera and affymax s hematide  among others  will together have a material impact on our long term financial results and financial condition  as will the success of bayer s cipro inhale program  in relation to which we have certain royalty rights 
because drug development and commercialization is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  there is a risk that our future revenue from one or more of these agreements will be less than we anticipate 
historically  we entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied proprietary pegylation reagents on a cost plus or fixed price basis 
our current strategy is to manufacture and supply pegylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or for third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship 
as a result  whenever possible  we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component 
while this will result in some revenue loss in the short term  product sales from these legacy agreements is generally low margin 
our strategy allows us to focus our proprietary manufacturing expertise and capacity on drugs and drug candidates where we have significant future economic opportunity 
key developments and trends in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and million in indebtedness 
we may from time to time purchase or retire convertible subordinated notes through cash purchase or exchanges for our other securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions  depending on  among other factors  our levels of available cash and the price at which such convertible notes are available for purchase 
for instance  in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million in par value of our convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we will evaluate similar future transactions  if any  in light of then existing market conditions 
these transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material to our business 
in  we plan to relocate all of our functions currently located in san carlos  california  including our corporate headquarters  to the mission bay area of san francisco  california  which we have subleased from pfizer inc in connection with the move  we expect to spend approximately million for tenant improvements to complete the mission bay facility and office and laboratory equipment in we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales and royalties  development and commercialization collaboration contracts and debt and equity financings 
in october  we received a payment of million from astrazeneca under the astrazeneca license as an upfront payment for the worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize oral nktr and nktr in december  we also received a payment of million from the exercise of a license option extension by one of our existing collaboration partners 
similar to  the results of our collaboration partnering efforts will also have a material impact on our cash position at the end of to date we have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities  and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs 
even if we or our partners are successful  we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all

product sales and royalties license  collaboration and other total revenue total revenue decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our pulmonary assets to novartis completed on december  novartis pulmonary asset sale and lower product manufacturing volumes required by our collaboration partners 
in connection with the novartis pulmonary asset sale  our collaboration agreement with novartis for tip was terminated and our collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag for cipro inhale was assigned to novartis 
for the year ended december   two of our partners  astrazeneca ab and ucb pharma  represented and  respectively  of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   the decrease in total revenue from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the termination of our collaboration agreements with pfizer related to exubera and ngi  which accounted for million  or  of our total revenue during the year ended december  we had no revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi for the year ended december  or four of our customers  bayer including bayer healthcare llc and bayer schering pharma ag  ucb pharma  novartis  and roche represented    and  respectively  of our total revenue during the year ended december  product sales and royalties product sales include cost plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners 
we also receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales once their products are approved for commercial sale 
royalty revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  we expect product sales and royalties to remain at approximately the same level as lower product demand from our collaboration partners resulted in decreased product sales of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   an increase in royalties of approximately million partially offset the decrease in product sales compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   exubera product sales to pfizer accounted for million of our total revenue 
we had no revenue from pfizer related to exubera for the year ended december  or non exubera product sales and royalties decreased by approximately million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in non exubera product sales and royalties is primarily attributable to the november  sale of aerogen ireland ltd  one of our former subsidiaries that manufactured and supplied general purpose nebulizer devices  which accounted for million in revenue for the year ended december  license  collaboration and other revenue license  collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and performance milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses 
the level of license  collaboration and other revenues depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront and milestone payments  the achievement of future milestones  the continuation of existing collaborations  the amount of reimbursed research and development work  and the signing of new collaborations 
the decrease in license  collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to elimination of any revenue from novartis related to tip and from bayer schering pharma ag for cipro inhale as a result of the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
in addition  included revenue related to a new intellectual property license agreement we entered into with roche and higher revenue from bayer under our collaboration agreement for bay this decrease is partially off set by million in revenue recognized related to our agreement with astrazeneca for nktr and nktr in  we recognized million of the million upfront payment received form astrazeneca and million in reimbursement of technology transfer costs incurred by us 
we expect to recognize the remainder of this upfront payment in we expect license  collaboration and other revenue to increase in due to the recognition of the remaining amount of the upfront payment we received from the astrazeneca collaboration transaction 
for the year ended december   license  collaboration and other revenue from pfizer related to exubera and ngi accounted for million of our license  collaboration and other revenue 
we had no collaboration and other revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi for the year ended december  or the year ended december  the increase in non pfizer collaboration and other revenue of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to revenue received from an intellectual property license agreement with roche that we entered into in for the year ended december   we have recognized increased license  collaboration and other revenue from bayer including bayer healthcare llc and bayer schering pharma ag of million under our collaboration agreements for bay and cipro inhale 
these increases are offset by decreased collaboration and other revenue of million from novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc under our collaboration agreement for tip and of million from solvay pharmaceuticals  inc and zelos therapeutics inc 
following the termination of those collaboration agreements in the timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties

cost of goods sold product gross profit product gross margin the decrease to product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to lower manufacturing volumes and a million success fee that became due to one of our former consulting firms as the final payment due under the agreement in the decrease in cost of goods sold and product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the termination of our exubera collaboration agreement with pfizer 
during the year ended december   exubera cost of goods sold was million and exubera gross margin was million 
the increase in product gross margin percentage resulted from the change in product mix with our product sales based on our proprietary pegylation materials having a relatively higher gross margin than exubera 
cost of goods sold during the year ended december  includes exubera manufacturing costs through the november  termination of the pfizer agreements 
costs related to our exubera manufacturing operations after november  are included in other cost of revenue 
as a result of the fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities  we expect product gross margin to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level of manufacturing orders from our customers

other cost of revenue     n a other cost of revenue included the idle exubera manufacturing capacity costs that were incurred by us prior to the termination of all of our inhaled insulin programs in april and exubera commercialization readiness costs incurred in idle exubera manufacturing capacity costs includes the costs of maintaining our manufacturing operating capacity after the termination of the pfizer agreements on november  through the termination of our inhaled insulin programs on april  idle exubera manufacturing capacity costs include amounts payable to pfizer and tech group under interim manufacturing capacity maintenance agreements and an allocation of manufacturing costs shared between commercial operations and research and development  including employee compensation and benefits  rent  and utilities 
idle exubera manufacturing costs were nil  million  and million for the year ended december    and  respectively 
exubera commercialization readiness costs were start up manufacturing costs we incurred in our exubera inhalation bulk powder manufacturing facility and our exubera inhaler device third party contract manufacturing locations in preparation for commercial scale manufacturing beginning in early exubera commercialization readiness costs were nil  nil  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

partnered with astrazeneca ab on september  partnered with bayer healthcare llc in august as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale  we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this product which was originally developed by nektar 
the collaboration agreement with novartis was terminated on december  in connection with the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
the collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag was assigned to novartis on december  in connection with the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
partnership for the collaboration and development of exubera inhalation powder and the next generation inhaled insulin with pfizer was terminated on november  we terminated all of our inhaled insulin programs in april certain proprietary pulmonary intellectual property was transferred to novartis as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
in connection with the novartis pulmonary asset sale  we transferred approximately of our personnel dedicated to our pulmonary operations and our san carlos research and manufacturing facility to novartis 
in addition  we ceased research activities on the tip research and development program  the cipro inhale program and certain other proprietary pulmonary development programs 
during  we had several phase clinical trials ongoing for nktr with treatment sites around the world for ovarian  breast  and colorectal cancers  we completed our phase clinical trial for nktr in march and performed development activities to prepare for a phase clinical trial  we continued to develop the nebulizer device for bay in preparation for the phase clinical trial that we are targeting to start in  and we continued to enroll patients in our phase clinical trial for nktr the decrease in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the divestiture of certain pulmonary research and development programs as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
research and development expense related to terminated pulmonary programs totaled million for the year ended december  which was comprised of facility  employee related and other costs 
additionally  in we recorded approximately million in other expenses related to the workforce reduction executed in february and additional severance costs related to the novartis pulmonary asset sale 
we expect research and development expense will increase in as compared to  as we complete or continue the phase clinical trials for nktr and the phase clinical trial for nktr and advance various product candidates through the research and pre clinical phase 
research and development expense remained at a consistent level in as compared to despite a significant increase in our investment in clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates in this was a result of the continued transition of our business to focus on our internal proprietary drug candidates in and a decrease in other research and development activities 
salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation expense decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as we continued to realize the benefits of our workforce reduction plans implemented in may and february facilities and equipment expense decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of lower depreciation due to the write off of the pfizer related equipment in and certain pulmonary property and equipment classified as held for sale at september  these decreases were offset by increased costs related to our ongoing clinical trials for our proprietary drug candidates  comprised increased outside services of million  including costs to cros  and increased materials and supplies expense of million 
during the year ended december   research and development expense included approximately million in additional costs related to the novartis pulmonary asset sale  including one time termination benefits and other costs 
during the year ended december   our research and development spending in our partnered drug development programs decreased compared to the year ended december  after the termination of our pfizer agreements for inhaled insulin in november spending related to our proprietary drug development programs increased as we continued to advance clinical development for nktr  nktr  and nktr the estimated completion dates for our programs are not reasonably certain

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales  royalties and research and development contracts  as well as public and private placements of debt and equity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and indebtedness of million  including million of convertible subordinated notes  million in capital lease obligations and million in other liabilities 
additionally at december   we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors  including our landlord  totaling million 
these letters of credit expire during and are secured by investments of similar amounts 
due to the continuing difficult environment in the credit markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our short term investments 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than one year 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of available for sale investments  excluding money market funds  with an average time to maturity of days 
based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements  we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
on september   we entered into a sublease with pfizer inc for a  square foot facility located in the mission bay area of san francisco  california mission bay facility 
the mission bay facility is currently under construction and is scheduled to be completed by the end of we anticipate that our capital requirements for related to the mission bay facility will total approximately million for tenant improvements and office and laboratory equipment

we are currently seeking a sublease tenant for our san carlos facility following our transition to the mission bay facility 
cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  which included the million upfront payment received from astrazeneca under the license agreement we entered into for nktr and nktr and million license extension payment received from roche in december in  we expect that cash flows from operating activities  excluding upfront payments received  if any  will increase in as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs 
during the year ended december   net cash used for our operating activities was million 
the decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   resulted from the million cash payment received from pfizer in under the exubera termination agreement and upfront payments of million and million received in from bayer healthcare llc and pfizer  respectively 
in addition  the net cash used for our operating activities for the year ended december  included a number of significant items including a million clinical development milestone received from bayer healthcare llc under our collaboration agreement for bay  payments by us to bespak europe ltd
