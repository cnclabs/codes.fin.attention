sources of revenue our revenue is comprised of fees for software  hosting and support  and fees for professional services 
recurring revenue  referred to in this report  includes software  hosting and support revenue from term license and subscription agreements 
software  hosting and support revenue includes fees earned under subscriptions and software license arrangements 
subscription arrangements are for a fixed term and include a bundled fee to access the software and data through our hosting services  and support services 
subscription revenue is recorded ratably over the length of the agreement 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
license arrangements are also for a fixed term a term license 
for term licenses  software  hosting and support revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
beginning in  we substantially eliminated perpetual license arrangements 
due to the change  perpetual license revenue decreased from million  or of revenue in the year ending december   to  in the year ending december  and  in the year ending december   or less than of revenue in the year ending december   and december   respectively 
our sales arrangements generally provide customers with the right to use our software up to a maximum number of users or transactions 
a number of our arrangements provide for additional fees for usage above the maximum  which are billed and recognized into revenue when determinable and earned 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from consulting  education  development services  and reimbursement of related travel costs 
consulting and education services include implementation and best practices consulting 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
professional services revenue was approximately of total revenue during  in  and in professional services are typically sold with initial sales arrangements and at times over the client engagement 
our typical education courses are billed on a per person  per class basis 
depending on the size and complexity of the client project  our consulting or development services contracts are either fixed price fixed scope or  more frequently  billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software and subscription arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses such as employee benefits  stock based compensation and payroll taxes for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  third party costs and equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  third party costs 
table of contents for voice enabled crm applications  travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients  amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we allocate most overhead expenses  such as office supplies  computer supplies  utilities  rent  depreciation for furniture and equipment  and certain employee benefits  based on headcount 
as a result  these common overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  product management expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
for subscription arrangements  we expense the related sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized 
we expense our sales commissions on license arrangements when earned  which is typically at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client 
since the majority of our historical revenue has been from software  hosting and support arrangements recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of corresponding revenue 
we expect to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel to increase the level of sales and marketing activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  translation fees  quality assurance  testing and allocated overhead 
to date  we have not capitalized any costs related to development of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  because the timing of the commercial releases of our products has substantially coincided with the attainment of technological feasibility 
beginning in  we capitalized costs of internally developed computer software to be sold as a service  which were incurred during the application development stage 
we capitalized approximately  of cost of internally developed computer software as of december  we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings 
to accomplish this  we plan to utilize existing personnel  hire additional personnel and  from time to time  contract with third parties 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our technology and product offerings 
we also expect that the capitalized cost of internally developed computer software will increase as we continue to sell and deliver our solution as a service 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates on an on going basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  and management believes these estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity markets  foreign currency fluctuations  and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
these assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of receivables and deferred tax assets  accounting for share based compensation  and software cost capitalization 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include elements comprising our software  hosting and support sales arrangements and whether the elements have stand alone and or fair value  whether the fees charged for our products and services are fixed or determinable  the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets  estimates regarding the recoverability and respective fair value of auction rate securities and all other investments  valuation allowances for receivables and deferred income tax assets  estimates of expected term and volatility 
table of contents in determining share based compensation expense  and software cost capitalization 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
revenue recognition we sell substantially all products under subscription arrangements subscriptions 
for a bundled fee  subscriptions provide the customer with access to the software and data over the internet  or on demand  and provide technical support services and software upgrades when and if available 
under subscriptions  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and these arrangements are considered service contracts which are outside the scope of industry topic  software 
accordingly  we account for sales of subscriptions under topic  revenue recognition 
we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement and professional services are recognized as incurred based on their relative fair values  in accordance with topic to a lesser extent  we sell products under term based software license arrangements licenses and account for them in accordance with industry topic  software 
licenses generally include multiple elements that are delivered up front or over time 
for example  under a term license  we deliver the software up front and provide hosting and support services over time 
fair value for each element in a license does not exist since none are sold separately  and consequently  the bundled revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because a the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services  and c performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 
our standard payment terms are net  although payment within days is considered normal 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed or determinable 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes to our practice of providing extended payment terms or providing concessions following a sale  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and could exceed our related loss allowance 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when applicable  a 
table of contents valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  and deductible timing differences 
the uncertainty of realizing these benefits has been based primarily on our lack of taxable earnings 
we continue to monitor the necessity for a full or partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
effective january   we adopted topic  income taxes  and it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
topic requires judgment when evaluating tax positions 
our judgment includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of our material positions taken on tax return filings 
the ultimate resolution of tax issues may result in a significant change to our recorded tax assets and liabilities 
share based compensation we record share based payment arrangements in accordance with topic  compensation stock compensation 
topic requires the cost of share based payment arrangements to be recorded in the statement of operations 
prior to  the estimated cost of share based payment arrangements was disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
share based compensation amounts are affected by our stock price as well as our assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our stock  our employee stock option exercise behaviors  forfeitures  and the related income tax effects 
our assumptions are based primarily on our historical information 
software capitalization industry topic  software  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
we establish technological feasibility upon completion of a working model 
historically  the period between achieving technological feasibility and general availability of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been immaterial 
accordingly  we have not capitalized any software development costs under this standard 
topic  intangibles goodwill and other  requires capitalization of costs incurred during the application development stage of certain internally developed computer software to be sold as a service 
we capitalize these software development costs when application development begins  it is probable that the project will be completed  and the software will be used as intended 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  training  maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred 
our policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll  benefits and other payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software development projects  as well as share based compensation costs  and external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalized costs are being amortized and recognized as a cost of software  hosting and support revenue  on a straight line basis  over the estimated useful lives of the related applications which is approximately three years 
the capitalized costs are included in intangible assets  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu addresses the criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the consensus will require companies allocating the overall consideration to each deliverable to use an estimated selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverables 
the asu will be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
we are currently in process of evaluating the impact of the asu and plan to adopt the standard effective january

year ended december  customer interactions in millions revenue by type recurring subscriptions  term licenses  hosting and support professional services revenue by geography in north america europe asia pacific overview of due to the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that began in and persisted in  our two primary objectives for were to take care of our customers and increase profitability 
our investments were managed and focused primarily on ensuring that existing customers were satisfied with their solutions and that new offerings we developed would enable us to expand the breadth of our product footprint 

table of contents total revenue for was million  compared to revenue of million 
software  hosting and support revenue increased in over we believe revenue increased in due to our focus on taking care of our customers combined with sales and marketing efforts aimed at increasing our customer base among consumer centric organizations 
additionally  we believe our expanded contact center offerings and our strategy to win small  initial deals with customers land and then grow our customer penetration based on measurable success expand resulted in increased revenue 
we adjusted our sales processes to better align with customer buying patterns  primarily by improving our understanding of the customers procurement requirements and the greater levels of scrutiny required to initiate and close projects in the difficult economic environment 
a portion of our revenue is also contingent on customers renewing subscription agreements 
we saw some customers reduce their solution needs at renewal time primarily because their requirements had changed 
additionally  we saw some smaller organizations fail to renew their subscriptions for a variety of reasons  including that some ceased operations  were consolidated  or purchased less expensive solutions from competitors 
revenue per customer increased primarily due to higher average selling price per customer  which we believe was attributable to expansion of our customer base 
sales to customers with annual revenues greater than billion and the public sector made up approximately of total revenue in  compared to approximately of total revenue in and of total revenue in as part of our objective to grow profitability while still making investments in customer satisfaction  we continued adding partners to support our solution offerings  capacity to support our hosting operations and customer support  research and development personnel to work on quarterly releases and quality assurance testing automation  and administrative personnel to support operations 
we reduced the investment in less productive sales and marketing channels and overall managed expenses including staff utilization and compensation 
we monitored and continue to monitor these investments on a regular basis so that we can reduce spending in a given function or across all functions if it significantly puts at risk increasing our profitability 
lastly  to further our competitive advantage  we invested in expanding our offering by acquiring hivelive  and in october  we rebranded our offering as rightnow cx  the customer experience suite 
these investments  and approximately million of incremental expense during the fourth quarter of as a result of headcount additions from the acquisition of hivelive  caused total expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but to decrease as a percentage of revenue during total revenue growth combined with improved leverage in our business model and the increased focus on operating expenses resulted in an improvement from an operating loss as a percentage of revenue of in to operating income as a percentage of revenue of in when compared to the year ended december   our results were impacted by the strength of the us dollar for the year ended december  relative to the british pound  australian dollar  and euro 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we discuss constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
constant currency discussions herein are based on comparison to currency exchange rates during the prior year 
for example  total revenue in the year ended december  increased by million  or over total revenue reported in the same period of if weighted average currency exchange rates in the year ended december  had remained constant with december   revenue as of december  would have increased by approximately million  which is an additional million  or a further 
in other words  the change in exchange rates between the year ended december  and had an unfavorable impact to revenue of approximately million or 
using similar methodology  the change in period end exchange rates between the year ended december  and had a favorable impact on deferred revenue of million 
expenses associated with international revenue are primarily paid in local currency  which generally provides a natural hedge to offset the revenue impact 
total cost of revenue and operating expenses in the year ended december  decreased by million  or over total cost of revenue and operating expenses reported in the year ended december  if currency exchange rates in the year ended december  had remained constant with the same period of  these total expenses 
table of contents as of december  would have increased by approximately million  which is an additional million  or a further 
in other words  the change in weighted average exchange rates between the year ended december  and had a favorable impact to these total expenses of approximately million or 
the expenses most significantly exposed to currency exchange fluctuations are within sales and marketing and professional services cost of revenue 
for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million of cash in our cash and investments balances increased to million at december  from million a year earlier  which was primarily due to strong collections  timing of new sales during the year  increased profitability over the prior year  and a non recurring litigation settlement gain which is described below in note d of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we grew our cash and investment balances while at the same time using million to repurchase  shares of our common stock and completing the acquisition of hivelive for a purchase price of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million

total active customers remained constant at  as of december  and december  we believe our latest product  appeals to large customers because of robust performance characteristics  notably within the contact center  which in turn has driven expansion within our existing customer base and higher average transaction prices per customer 
average recurring revenue per customer increased as a result of sales of capacity additions  contract renewals and new products

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in   in  and  in  consists primarily of foreign withholding taxes  and various state income taxes 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards  tax credits  foreign rate differentials  and non deductible meal and entertainment expenses 
our effective tax rate in will depend on a number of factors  such as the amount and mix of stock based compensation expense to be recorded under topic  the level of business in state and foreign tax jurisdictions  management s expectation of the realization of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  and other factors 
at december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets that have been reserved in full by a valuation allowance 
during  we anticipate that we may recognize a tax benefit as a result of the removal of some or all of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets dependent on our financial performance in excluding any benefit from the removal of some or all of the valuation allowance  we expect our full year effective income tax rate will increase to more closely approximate the federal and state blended statutory rate
