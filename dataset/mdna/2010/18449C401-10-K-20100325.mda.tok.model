table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design and sell environmentally proven technologies and solutions for the global emission reduction market based upon our portfolio of patents  extensive library of performance data and know how 
we believe our core competencies to be the innovation  application  development and marketing of technological products and solutions to enable emission control 
our suite of technologies offers a broad range of proven  market ready solutions to reduce emissions while saving costs through fuel economy improvement and other engine operating efficiencies 
we believe that clean air  energy efficiency and sustainability continue to attract increasing attention around the world  as does the need to develop alternative energy sources 
increasingly  combustion engine development is influenced by concern over climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and toxic exhaust emissions 
because carbon dioxide results from the combustion of fossil fuels  reducing fuel consumption is often cited as the primary way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
further  because diesel engines are or more fuel efficient than gasoline engines  the increased use of diesel engines relative to gasoline engines is one way to reduce overall fuel consumption  and thereby  significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
we believe the diesel engine is an d will remain a strategic and economic source of motive power 
however  diesel engines emit higher levels of two toxic pollutants particulate matter and nitrogen oxides than gasoline engines fitted with catalytic converters 
both of these pollutants affect human health and damage the environment 
these factors  among others  have led to legislation and standards that may drive demand for our products and solutions 
our operating revenue consists of product sales  technology licensing fees and royalties  and consulting and other 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of our revenue sources in relation to total revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  product sales license and royalty revenue consulting and other total the mix of our revenue sources during any reporting period may have a material impact on our operating results 
in particular  our execution of technology licensing agreements  and the timing of the revenue recognized from these agreements  has not been predictable 
product sales include our patented platinum plus fuel borne catalyst products and concentrate and hardware primarily  our patented aris advanced reagent injector and dosing systems for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides  our platinum plus purifier systems and catalyzed wire mesh filters 
our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst is registered with the us environmental protection agency epa and other environmental authorities around the world 
our products are sold to distributors  resellers  various transportation segments  including on road  off road  rail and marine  among other end users  through our distribution network and direct sales 
we license our aris nitrogen oxides selective catalytic reduction scr system and the combination of exhaust gas recirculation egr with scr to others  generally with an up front fee for the technology and know how and an on going royalty per unit 
we also sell finished aris based scr systems to potential aris licensees and end users 
we are actively seeking additional licensees for both mobile and stationary applications 
we offer rights to our catalyzed wire mesh technology through license agreements as well as selling finished filters for use with our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst 
since inception  we have devoted efforts to the research and development of technologies and products in various areas  including platinum fuel borne catalysts for emission reduction and fuel economy improvement and nitrogen oxides reduction systems to control emissions from diesel engines 
although we believe we have made progress in commercializing our technologies  we have experienced recurring losses from our operations 
our accumulated deficit amounted to approximately million as of december  the internally generated funds from our revenue sources have not been sufficient to cover our operating costs 
the ability of our revenue sources  especially product sales and technology license fees and royalties  to generate significant cash for our operations is critical to our long t erm success 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of our products or technologies or in completing our current licensing agreement negotiations 
to the extent our internally generated funds prove to be inadequate  we believe that we may need to obtain additional working capital through equity financings 
however  we can give no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based upon assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned 
for technology licensing fees paid by licensees that are fixed and determinable  accepted by the customer and nonrefundable  revenue is recognized upon execution of the license agreement  unless it is subject to completion of any performance criteria specified within the agreement  in which case it is deferred until such performance criteria are met 
royalties are frequently required pursuant to license agreements or may be the subject of separately executed royalty agreements 
revenue from royalties is recognized ratably over the royalty period based upon periodic reports submitted by the royalty obligor or based on minimum royalty requirements 
revenue from product sales is recognized when title has passed and our products are shipped to our customer  unless the purchase order or contract specifically requires us to provide installation for hardware purchases 
for hardware projects in which we are responsible for installation either directly or indirectly by third party contractors  revenue is recognized when the hardware is installed and or accepted  if the project requires inspection and or acceptance 
other revenue primarily consists of grant income  engineering and development consulting services 
revenue from technical consulting services is generally recognized and billed as the services are performed 
revenue from grant income is recognized when grant income is earned 
generally  our license agreements are non exclusive and specify the geographic territories and classes of diesel engines covered  such as on road vehicles  off road vehicles  construction  stationary engines  marine and railroad engines 
at the time of the execution of our license agreements  we assign the right to the licensee to use our patented technologies 
the up front fees are not subject to refund or adjustment 
we recognize the license fee as revenue at the inception of the license agreement when we have reasonable assurance that the technologies transferred have been accepted by the licensee and collectability of the license fee is reasonably assured 
the nonrefundable up front fee is in exchange for the culmination of the earnings process as the company has accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenue 
under our license agreements  there is no significant obligation for future performance required of the company 
each licensee must determine if the rights to our patented technologies are usable for their business purposes and must determine the means of use without further involvement by the company 
in most cases  licensees must make additional investments to enable the capabilities of our patents  including significant engineering  sourcing of and assembly of multiple components 
such investments are for the benefit of the licensee 
our obligation to defend valid patents does not represent an additional deliverable to which a portion of an arrangement fee should be allocated 
defending the patents is generally consistent with our representation in the license agreement that such patents are legal and valid 

table of contents research and development costs costs relating to the research  development and testing of our technologies and products are charged to operations as they are incurred 
these costs include verification programs  evaluation and testing projects  salary and benefits  consulting fees  materials and testing gear 
our research and development expenses totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
patents and patent expense patents  which include all direct incremental costs associated with initial patent filings and costs to acquire rights to patents under licenses  are stated at cost and amortized using the straight line method over the remaining useful lives  ranging from one to twenty years 
indirect and other patent related costs are expensed as incurred 
patent amortization expense for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of our patents each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the evaluation determines that the patent s remaining useful life has changed  the remaining carrying amount of the patent is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
we also evaluate our patents for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the testing for impairment includes evaluating the undiscounted cash flows of the asset and the remaining period of amortization or useful life 
the factors used in evaluating the undiscounted cash flows include current operating results  projected future operating results and cash flows  and any other material factors that may affect the continuity or the usefulness of the asset 
if impairment exists or if we decide to abandon a patent  the patent is written down to its fair value based upon discounted cash flows 
at december  and  the company s patents  net  were  and  respectively 
the types of events and changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of our patents is not recoverable and therefore  impairment testing would be triggered include the following permanent elimination of mandated compliance with emission reduction standards  reduction in overall market prevalence of diesel engines  obsolescence of our technologies due to new discoveries and inventions  and an adverse action or assessment against our technologies 
our technology is comprised of patents  patent applications  trade or service marks  data and know how 
we consider the life of our technologies to be commensurate with the remaining term of our us and corresponding foreign patents 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from through  with the majority of the material patents upon which we rely expiring in and beyond 
we believe that we have sufficient patent coverage surrounding our core patents that effectively serves to provide us longer proprietary protection 
our technologies comprise technologies that have been asserted as the technologies of choice by various automotive original equipment manufacturers oems to meet mandates to comply with upcoming regulatory requirements that go into effect starting in epa 
we monitor evolving technologies in the automotive and other applicable industries to evaluate obsolescence of any of our patents 
although we have seen certain suspensions and delays in mandated emissions requirements  we expect sufficient revenue over the remaining life of the underlying patents to recover the carrying value of our patents 
we believe the emission reduction mandates will be phased in over time so that despite volatility in our revenue streams  we should realize the expected revenue from our patents 
we have consistently applied our methodologies used for valuing intangible assets during the year ended december  from the prior year but believe we incorporated more educated assumptions about our opportunities based upon the third party market data that we did not have in the prior year 
our intellectual property strategy has been to build upon our base of core technology with newer advanced technology patents developed or purchased by us 
in many instances  we have incorporated the technology embodied in our core patents into patents covering specific product applications  including product design and packaging 
we believe this building block approach provides greater protection to us and our licensees than relying solely on our core patents 

table of contents in evaluating the viability of our patents  we used a cash flow model with the following assumptions liquidity cash we will maintain our patents in force in the appropriate geographical areas by paying the required maintenance and annuity fees 
we expect to continue to invest in our patents to ensure adequate coverage and protection from inventions related to our existing patents 
our expected capital expenditures include funds for prosecution of additional and pending patents 
revenue growth rates we based our royalty revenue projections upon third party market data regarding volume production projections for various engine sizes and vehicle classifications 
we estimated our market penetration rates based upon our understanding of market share of our current licensees and expectations of future licensing activities 
we recognize certain contingent license fee revenue once volume milestones have been achieved 
we used an expected rate for non refundable  up front fees from future licensees because historically the timing and amount of license fees have been unpredictable 
our year over year growth rates assumed for purifier systems were up to based upon further mandated low emission zones 
sensitivity analysis we evaluated the sensitivity of our revenue streams using judgmentally selected discount rates ranging from to should revenues not meet projected targets

the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  in  a decrease of  or  reflecting declines in product sales as well as licensing fees and royalties 
operating revenue in consisted of approximately in product sales  in technology licensing fees and royalties and in grant revenue 
of our operating revenue  was from product sales and was from technology licensing fees and royalties 
the mix of our revenue sources during any reporting period may have a material impact on our operating results 
in particular  our execution of technology licensing agreements  and the timing of the revenue recognized from these agreements  has not been predictable 
product sales in were  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in product sales was attributable primarily to lower demand for our platinum plus purifier systems  a product comprised of a diesel particulate filter along with our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst for compliance with the requirements of the london low emission zone lez because in  there was no london lez compliance deadline 
the next compliance deadlines for the london lez are in and  although the mayor of london has proposed suspension of the deadline to be continued until we received approval in october from transport for london to supply our purifier systems as an emission reduction solution that meets the standards established for the london lez 
 the deadlines for compliance with the london lez will be phased in over time for different classifications of vehicles 
february was the compliance deadline for vehicles greater than metric tons and july was the compliance deadline for motor coaches and vehicles greater than metric tons 
the sales of our purifier systems for compliance with the requirements of the london lez provide us with recurring revenue from use of our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst that enables the regeneration of the diesel particulate filter 
we believe we will have the opportunity to expand this business opportunity as additional low emission zones are established throughout europe and elsewhere 
technology licensing fees and royalties were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
our technology licensing fees and royalties include fees upon execution of new agreements and royalties from existing licensees  primarily for use of our aris technologies 
we did not execute new technology licensing agreements in during  we executed new technology licensing agreements with headway machinery co  ltd 
zhucheng city  china  hilite international  inc cleveland  ohio and eaton corporation cleveland  ohio and recognized revenue from license fees 
we are continuing our efforts to consummate technology license agreements with manufacturers and component suppliers 
our total cost of revenue was  in compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in our cost of sales is due to lower product sales volume 
our total gross profit as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  with the increase attributable to the mix of higher margin product sales 
gross margin for product sales in was  or of product sales  compared to  or in our cost of license fee and royalty revenue was zero in and resulting in  and  gross margin  respectively 
likewise  the cost of our grant revenue in was zero resulting in  gross margin 
our cost of product sales includes the costs we incur to formulate our finished products into saleable form for our customers  including material costs  labor and processing costs charged to us by our outsourced blenders  installers and other vendors  packaging costs incurred by our outsourced suppliers  freight costs to customers and inbound freight charges from our suppliers 
our inventory is primarily maintained off site by our outsourced suppliers 
to date  our purchasing  receiving  inspection and internal transfer costs have been insignificant and have been included in cost of product sales 
in addition  the costs of our warehouse which we occupied through october are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other en tities  because some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of revenue and others like us exclude a portion of such costs from gross margin  including such costs instead within operating expenses 
cost of licensing fees and royalties is zero as there are no incremental costs associated with the revenue 
cost of consulting and other revenue includes incremental out of pocket costs to provide consulting services 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were  in the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to lower professional services  particularly investor relations and financial advisory services  lower compensation and benefits  travel  marketing and bad debts 
we made a concerted effort in to contain our costs and eliminate those costs that were redundant or deemed unnecessary 
selling  general and administrative expenses are summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation total compensation and benefits professional services travel occupancy  property and business taxes  supplies  postage and delivery sales and marketing expenses recovery provision for bad debts depreciation and all other total professional services includes  of non cash stock based compensation charges for fair value of warrants 
the company s aggregate non cash charges for the fair value of stock options and warrants in the year ended december  were  of which  has been included in selling  general and administrative expenses and  in research and development expenses 
this compares to  in total non cash stock based compensation expense in of which  has been included in selling  general and administrative expenses  in compensation   in professional and  included in research and development expenses 
excluding the non cash stock based charges  compensation and benefit expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  or  primarily due to a reduction in workforce in in addition  includes no bonuses  whereas the compensation and benefits included bonuses of approximately  total severance charges in the year ended december  were  comprised of a third quarter charge of  and a first quarter charge of  in august  the board of directors adopted a plan to implement a company wide restructuring effective august  we incurred severance charges totaling  in the third quarter of related to the reduction of approximately of the company s workforce 
in addition  non executive members of the company s board of directors agreed to receive of their annual compensation effective commencing for the second half of  reduction in 
on february   the company s board of directors elected michael l 
asmussen  then  as president and chief executive officer replacing dr 
bern hard steiner 
mr 
asmussen was also appointed to serve as a director of the company 
effective february   dr 
steiner resigned as a director of the company 
as a consequence of his termination of employment  dr 
steiner is entitled to salary of approximately  eur  per annum until september   the remainder of his contract term  along with specified expenses not to exceed an aggregate of approximately  together totaling  to be paid in monthly installments until september we have restructured the company so that each employee will manage resources based upon data driven revenue expectations 
as such  new processes are being established to ensure organizational and individual discipline and accountability 
professional services decreased  or  to  in compared to  in the company s professional services include audit related costs  investor relations and financial advisory fees 
in addition to curtailment of outside agency use  a significant component of the decrease in professional services is attributable to stock based compensation charges of  for the fair value of warrants issued for financial advisory services such amount represented the remaining stock based amount that was amortized over the period that services were rendered 

table of contents we relocated our us corporate offices in january and incurred rent expense on both our old and new us headquarters due to the timing of our relocation and expiration of the old lease 
the lease for the new us office provides for more square feet at a lower per square foot cost resulting in total rent expense at a slightly higher rate than but with lower cash outlay in the early years of the new lease 
recovery provision for bad debts decreased  or  reflecting a recovery of  in compared to a provision of  in the prior year 
bad debt as a percentage of product sales was in compared to in the recovery provision for bad debts is attributable to specific aged account activity 
research and development expenses were  in the year ended december  compared to  in  a decline of  
our work for the california showcase is ongoing along with certain supplemental environmental programs sponsored by california air resources board carb 
we continue work to overcome gaps in our technology and product portfolios brought about by volatile markets and past development setbacks 
in addition to development of new products  our projects included field testing of emission control technologies 
the projects included laboratory testing on additive formulations 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  and include  and  respectively  of non cash charges for the f air value of stock options granted 
in january  epa verifications were withdrawn on two of our products because available test results were not accepted by epa as meeting new emissions testing requirements for no measurement 
presently  we do not intend to seek verification of these products 
we have no assurance of the extent of additional testing that may be required by epa or whether it will be adequate to remove any remaining concern the epa may have regarding use of our fuel borne catalyst 
we believe that it is an essential requirement of the us retrofit market that emissions control products and systems are verified under the us epa and or carb protocols in order to qualify for funding from epa and or carb programs 
funding for these emissions control products and systems is generally limited to those products and technologies that have already been verified 
verification is also useful for commercial acceptability 
we believe that the lack of carb verification will result in a shift of expected us retrofit revenue into future periods 
we expect to have carb verification in the fourth quarter of we may have the opportunity to obtain a conditional carb verification before all of our testing has been concluded 
without full carb verification  our us retrofit opportunities are limited although certain jurisdictions have been satisfied with other of our certifications 
we received the epa registration in december for the platinum plus fuel borne catalyst for use in bulk fuel by refiners  distributors and truck fleets 
in  we completed the certification protocol for particulate filters and additives for use with particulate filters with vert  the main recognized authority in europe that tests and verifies diesel particulate filters for emissions and health effects 
in  the swiss environmental agency buwal approved the platinum plus fuel borne catalyst for use with particulate filters 
in  the us mining  safety and health administration accepted platinum plus fuel borne catalyst for use in all underground mines 
in  we received accreditation for our purifier systems  our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst used with a diesel particulate filter  to be sold for compliance with the emission reduction requirements established for the london lez 
in  the german federal environment agency  the umweltbundesamt uba  issued a non disapproval for sale of platinum plus fuel borne catalyst for use in conjunction with up to  diesel particulate filters in germany  further work will be required to lift fully the  unit restriction 
in in addition to emphasis on the global retrofit market  we started to focus on fuel economy opportunities in the us in non road sectors  including rail  marine  mining and construction  and in  expect continued focus on these sectors by our distributors rather than through our direct selling efforts 
platinum plus fuel borne catalyst is effective with regular sulfur diesel  ultra low sulfur diesel  arctic diesel kerosene and biodiesel 
when used with blends of biodiesel and ultra low sulfur diesel  our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst prevents the normal increase in nitrogen oxides associated with biodiesel  as well as offering emission reduction in particulates and reduced fuel consumption 
platinum plus is used to improve combustion which acts to reduce emissions and improve the performa nce and reliability of emission control equipment 
platinum plus fuel borne catalyst takes catalytic action into engine cylinders where it improves combustion  thereby reducing particulates  unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions  which also results in improving fuel economy 
our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst lends itself to a wide range of enabling solutions including fuel economy  diesel particulate filtration  low emission biodiesel  carbon reduction and exhaust emission reduction 
the improvement attributable to platinum plus fuel borne catalyst may vary as a result of engine age  application in which the engine is used  load  duty cycle  speed  fuel quality  tire pressure and ambient air temperature 
generally  after use of platinum plus fuel borne catalyst during a conditioning period  our customers derive economic benefits from the use of our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst whenever the price of diesel fuel is in excess of per us g allon 

table of contents patent amortization and other patent related expense  including abandonment of  of previously capitalized patents  was  in the year ended december  compared to  in  a decline of

foreign currency transaction gains  net of losses  were  in compared to net transaction losses of  in interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  or  due to lower invested balances and rates of return during other income expense was  in and is comprised of interest expense of  and a net unrealized gain on investments of  the company had an unrealized gain on the fair value of its investment in auction rate securities ars of  and an unrealized loss of  on its ars put right arsr  resulting in  net unrealized gain 
the other income expense consists of interest expense  impairment loss on investments  net  and miscellaneous other income of  in  the fair value of the ars declined million from par value  which loss was charged to other expense 
upon the initial recording of the arsr at a fair value of million  we recognized a gain  which together with the million decline in fair value of the ars  resulted in a net charge to operations in of million included in other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
we compare the ubs determined current value per the monthly statements from ubs to the par value of the ars  noting that ubs may have an interest in being conservative in its values because we may seek additional loan advances from ubs based upon of their ars value 
the ubs current value of our ars increased million from december  to december  we compare the ubs determined current value to the fair value computed by the company with the assistance from a third party valuation firm 
the compared values differed by approximately million at december  and million at december   with the ubs values being lower 
in making our fair value determination  we considered a range of fair value estimates with the assistance of our third party valuation firm  s understanding of all available factors resulting in low  mid point and high fair value assessments with a total range of between the low and high fair values 
we believe that the use of the mid point range is appropriate based on the available information at december  we note that the ubs valuation methodology for student loan ars considers many variables in its cash flow modeling of student loan ars including  but not limited to general ars considerations a projected forward interest rates b cost of funds eg  perpetually failed auctions c issuer optionality and redemption provisions general collateral performance considerations a prepayment speeds b deferment and forbearance c delinquencies d gross default rates 
table of contents the above assumptions  plus additional considerations  are formulated and applied by ubs 
a cash flow  or series of cash flows  is generated for both the student loan assets ie  the student loans and cash as well as the corresponding liabilities ie  the ars and other debt securities 
the scheduled interest and final principal payments on each ars note are then discounted to arrive at a net present value npv 
finally  the npv for each security is adjusted to reflect the current market liquidity for ars and ubs s proprietary valuation methodology is routinely calibrated to observe market transactions 
we have not relied upon the ubs determined values as our fair value 
we have used the third party assessment to evaluate if the ubs values are reasonable as well as evaluating the discount from par that several other public companies used  companies that also have student loan ars issued by ubs 
we continue to caution our investors about the credit risk should ubs be unable to fulfill its commitment under the offer for a put right permitting us to sell to ubs at par value all ars previously purchased from ubs at a future date any time during a two year period beginning june  
there can be no assurance that the financial position of ubs will be such as to afford the company the ability to acquire the par value of its ars upon exercise of the ars right 
in our assessment of fair values  we monitor developments and changes in the student loan ars market 
key general considerations for include the following during  indications of market liquidity have improved 
ars spreads have continued to contract over the course of the year 
as a result  we have reduced the liquidity risk premium on our student loan ars 
spreads indicated by the bloomberg bear stearns student loan index on aaa issues of year or greater duration have decreased substantially from the all time high of basis points as of december  to basis points as of december  this is further evidence these spreads are on a downward trend 
probabilities of default are slightly lower on most securities given falling credit spreads in the market over the course of the year and remain in the range of on a cumulative basis for aaa securities 
probabilities of passing auction return of capital within a year period have remained stable over the year 
libor interest rate forwards rose during the year at a faster rate than treasury strip securities  which caused upward pressure on prices 
monetary actions over the past year have reduced yields on short term treasury securities and the federal funds rate remained unchanged  at a target range of to 
similarly  the discount rate remained unchanged at 
however  many market participants are now forecasting higher inflation over the longer term due to these actions

the company used an independent third party valuation firm to assist it with its determination of fair values of the ars and arsr 
classification of investments as current or non current is dependent upon management s intended holding period  the security s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions 
at december   the company classified all investments as current based on management s intention and ability to liquidate the investments within the next twelve months 
at december   the company classified million of the ars as current based on management s intention to use such securities as consideration if ubs demands payment on its loan prior to the date the company exercises the arsr 
the company will be exposed to credit risk should ubs be unable to fulfill its commitment under the offer 
there can be no assurance that the financial position of ubs will be such as to afford the company the ability to acquire the par value of its ars upon exercise of the put right 
our management believes that based upon the company s cash and cash equivalents and investments at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow  financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we have evaluated our cash burn and determined that we have sufficient resources to fund operations for the next twelve months 
presently  we do not have liquidity sources other than the ubs credit facility but believe we will have the ability to use the ars as collateral for additional borrowings  including possible third party financing as we near june   the date that the par value of the ars will be available to us from ubs

we expect to incur losses through although we have generated revenue from sales of our platinum plus fuel borne catalyst  purifier systems  aris advanced reagent injector and dosing systems for selective catalytic reduction  catalyzed wire mesh filters and from technology licensing fees and royalties  revenue to date has been insufficient to cover our operating expenses  and we continue to be dependent upon sources other than operations to finance our working capital requirements 
historically  we have been primarily dependent upon funding from new and existing stockholders 
the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in any future financing effort to obtain the necessary working capital to support operations or if such financing is available  that it will be on acceptable terms 
in the event that our business does not generate sufficient cash and external financing is not available or timely  we would be required to substantially reduce our level of operations and capital expenditures in order to conserve cash and possibly seek joint ventures or other transactions  including the sale of assets 
these reductions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our customers and suppliers 
our long term continuation is dependent upon the achievement of profitable operations and the ability to generate sufficient cash from operations  equity financings and other funding sources to meet our obligations
