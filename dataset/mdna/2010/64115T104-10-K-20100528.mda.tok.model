overview netscout systems was founded in and is headquartered in westford  massachusetts 
we design  develop  manufacture  market  sell and support market leading unified service delivery management  service assurance and application and network performance management solutions focused on assuring service delivery for the world s largest  most demanding and complex internet protocol  or ip  based service delivery environments 
we manufacture and market these products in integrated hardware and software solutions that are used by commercial enterprises  large governmental agencies and telecommunication service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix and quantity of products and services sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products  growth in employee related costs  including commissions  and the expansion of our operations 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include  but are not limited to  our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  development of strategic partnerships  competition  successful integration efforts and current economic conditions 
results overview despite a difficult economy  we continued to execute on our core strategies and were able to generate net income and net income per share growth of and  respectively  in fiscal year through gross margin improvements and reduced operating costs 
fiscal year also included strong bookings  especially in our service provider vertical market  and strong cash flow 
our revenue results in the second half of this past year were driven by a percent year over year increase in bookings 
this bookings increase  as stated earlier  was due to growth in sales to our customers in the service provider vertical market 
we expect that momentum of bookings growth to continue into fiscal year led 
table of contents primarily by continued performance in the wireless service provider sector and a return to strength in our core enterprise vertical markets led by financial services and government 
in addition to record bookings  deferred revenue increased million during the year ended march  as we saw our customers continuing to make large commitments through renewals of maintenance service contracts 
although revenue decreased from fiscal year  we achieved significant gross margin improvements 
gross margin for fiscal year was  up points from fiscal year we did this in part through price actions and cost reduction 
in addition  there was a shift towards higher margin products 
we also met our goal of expanding operating margins and improved operating efficiencies 
as a result  our fiscal year operating margin was  up from in fiscal year we also achieved a record high cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of over million at march  this represents an increase of million over the previous fiscal year end and million over the previous quarter end 
all of these results are supported by our unwavering commitment to develop market leading products that will expand our market reach while solving the challenges facing it managers in such areas as virtualization and cloud computing 
during our fiscal year we launched some significant new products aimed at increasing our value proposition in the enterprise  including the government and financial services sectors 
we also remain focused on building market share in the very fast growing wireless service provider market 
during fiscal year  we released subscriber intelligence  which is an important new product targeted as this sector 
use of non gaap financial measures from time to time in press releases regarding quarterly earnings  presentations and other communications  we may provide financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
recent non gaap financial measures have included non gaap revenue  income from operations  net income and net income per diluted share  each of which were adjusted from amounts determined based on gaap to exclude the effect of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce to fair value acquired deferred revenue resulting from our acquisition of network general in november  and to add back share based compensation expenses  merger integration expenses and the amortization of acquired intangible assets  net of related income tax effects 
management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand  manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors that management uses in planning and forecasting future periods 
management believes these non gaap financial measures enhance the reader s overall understanding of netscout s current financial performance and its prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how the company plans and measures its business 
we believe that providing these non gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies and also enables investors to consider our operating results on both a gaap and non gaap basis during the period where gaap results were affected by our acquisition of network general 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap  should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 
for more information on our critical accounting policies  see note to the attached consolidated financial statements 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb s  authoritative guidance 
under the provisions  we have classified our investments as available for sale which are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices and associated unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents typically consist of money market instruments  commercial paper with a maturity of three months or less and cash maintained with various financial institutions 
marketable securities generally consist of us treasury bills  commercial paper with an original maturity of greater than three months  us government bonds  agency bonds  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and municipal bonds 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities  corporate bonds and certificate of deposits 
the auction rate securities we hold are all collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal education loan program  or ffelp 
auction rate securities typically were stated at par value prior to february due to liquidity provided through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities the failure of these auctions has created illiquidity 
as a result  par value no longer 
table of contents approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
a discounted cash flow model was used to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities as of march  and the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  a liquidity risk premium and expected holding periods of the investments 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of march  we have recorded a cumulative decline in the fair value of auction rate securities of million million net of tax which was deemed temporary 
assumptions used to value these securities and in determining the temporary nature of this impairment require significant judgment by management 
changes in the assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair values and the failure of these securities to return to par value or a decision by the company to sell these securities at a loss could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because we have determined that the software components of our products are more than incidental to the functionality and value of these products  we recognize our revenue in accordance with authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software and hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration  typically for month periods 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the delivered elements  generally hardware and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a semi annual basis and update  when appropriate  our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
as discussed in the recent accounting standards section of this management discussion and analysis  our accounting for revenue arrangements will change next fiscal year with the adoption of new authoritative guidance 
commission expense we recognize commission expense related to the renewal of maintenance contracts at the time an order is booked 
as a result  commission expense can be recognized in full even though the related revenue may not be fully recognized 
commission expense on product revenue and corresponding new maintenance contracts is recognized in the same period as the related product revenue  typically upon shipment 
uncollected deferred product revenue because of our revenue recognition policies  there are circumstances for which we are unable to recognize product revenue relating to sales transactions that have been shipped and billed 
while the receivable represents 
table of contents an enforceable obligation  for balance sheet presentation purposes we have not recognized the deferred revenue or the related account receivable and no amounts appear in our consolidated balance sheets for such transactions 
the aggregate amount of unrecognized accounts receivable and deferred revenue was million and million at march  and  respectively 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out  or fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory to reflect its net realizable value when lower than original cost 
as of march  and  net realizable value adjustments included within inventory on the balance sheet totaled million and thousand  respectively 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets purchase accounting requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed product technology  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include reserves for litigation and other contingencies and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by netscout professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  research and development  sales and executive management 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
the carrying value of goodwill was million as of march  and goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in income equal to that excess 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  goodwill may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and goodwill is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets is recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
our acquired intangible assets include acquired software  customer relationships and an 
table of contents indefinite lived tradename resulting from the acquisition of network general on november  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis  except for the acquired tradename which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived sniffer tradename is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis 
at march   we determined that there had been no impairment of acquired intangible assets or indefinite lived assets 
significant judgment and estimates are made when estimating fair value and useful lives for acquired intangible assets 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  the value of these assets and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred  except for certain software development costs 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the related software products are available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begin once projects are ready for sale to the general public and are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
capitalized software development costs are periodically assessed for recoverability in the event of changes to the anticipated future revenue for the software products or changes in product technologies 
unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the software products would be expensed in the period in which such a determination is made 
derivative financial instruments the fasb s authoritative guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
all hedging activities must be documented at the inception of the hedge and must meet the definition of highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows in order for the derivative to qualify for hedge accounting 
under the guidance  if an instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value each period for open contracts  measured as of the end of the period  are recorded to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings each period 
management must perform initial and ongoing tests in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
in accordance with the guidance  we account for our instruments under hedge accounting 
the effectiveness and a measurement of ineffectiveness of qualifying hedge contracts is assessed by netscout quarterly 
we record the fair value of our derivatives in other current assets and other current liabilities 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of qualifying hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the forecasted transaction occurs  with any ineffective portion classified directly to our consolidated statement of operations based on the expense categories of the items being hedged 
when forecasted transactions occur  unrealized gains or losses associated with the effective portion of the hedge are reclassified to the respective expense categories in our consolidated statement of operations 
gains or losses related to hedging activity are included as operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after april  and those shares granted in prior periods but not yet vested as of april  under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 

table of contents determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors during fiscal years   and  and an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees during fiscal years  and we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
income taxes significant judgments and estimates are made when calculating our annual provision for income taxes 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of these assets and liabilities as well as on acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider past performance  future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  million of federal and state tax credits and million other temporary book and tax accounting differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will be realized and  accordingly  do not require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be credited to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
a valuation allowance has been established for certain federal foreign tax credits related to the network general acquisition  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria 
if it is later determined that we are able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then we will recognize these deferred tax assets through a benefit to our income tax provision and the reduction of the valuation allowance 
an adjustment to these deferred tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these standards clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
a two step approach is utilized for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis  that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
as used in the accounting standards  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended march  and revenue product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products

no one direct customer or indirect channel partner accounted for more than of our total revenue during fiscal years ended march  and fiscal year ended march  change dollars in thousands of revenue of revenue revenue product service product 
the  or million  decrease in product revenue was primarily the result of decreased volume due to the impact of the global economic downturn on our customers capital spending during the year ended march   which included a million decline in product revenues for our financial vertical and a million decline in our other enterprise businesses 
this decline was partially offset by growth in our service provider vertical of million 
while product bookings increased over fiscal year we entered with significant backlog which allowed for higher revenue in fiscal year on lower bookings 
compared to fiscal year  we realized an increase of approximately in the average selling price per unit due to a shift in product mix towards our infinistream product line and away from lower priced probes 
we also generated million of product revenue from our new lower capacity infinistream product launched during the year 
product revenue recognized during the year ended march  reflects a million purchase accounting adjustment that was made to reduce acquired deferred product revenue to fair value as a result of the network general acquisition 
the impact of purchase accounting adjustments was not material for fiscal year product revenue as a percent of total revenue decreased three points when compared to the year ended march  service 
the  or million  increase in service revenue was due to the renewal of maintenance contracts associated with the acquired network general business at full value  while deferred revenue acquired in november and subsequently recognized into revenue had been reduced to fair value as required under purchase accounting 
this adjustment to service revenue was million lower in fiscal year than it was in fiscal year this was offset by a million decrease in maintenance revenue due to a portion of our customers not renewing their customer support agreements as well as the company ending its support for some of its older product models 
while our renewal rate has not changed significantly from prior periods  growth in product revenue and associated new maintenance typically offsets lost renewals 
with an decline in product revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  this offset did not occur at the same rate as in prior periods 

table of contents total product and service revenue from direct and indirect channels are as follows fiscal year ended march  change dollars in thousands of revenue of revenue indirect direct total revenue the  or million  increase in indirect channel revenue is the result of a growth in our international revenue 
sales to customers outside the united states are primarily export sales through indirect channel partners  who are generally responsible for distributing our products and providing technical support and service to customers within their territories 
sales arrangements are primarily transacted in united states dollars 
our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside the united states that are shipped to our united states based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers fulfill customer orders based upon joint selling efforts in conjunction with our direct sales force and may subsequently ship our products to international locations  however  we report these shipments as united states revenue since we ship the products to a domestic location 
the  or million  decrease in direct channel revenue and change in sales mix between direct and indirect is primarily the result of lower revenue in the united states due to the decline in volume with our larger direct financial services and enterprise customers 
total revenue by geography is as follows fiscal year ended march  change dollars in thousands of revenue of revenue united states international europe asia rest of world subtotal international total revenue united states revenues declined  or million  due to the impact of the global economic downturn on capital spending for our enterprise and financial services customers  however  we saw the beginnings of a return to health in the financial services vertical and strong growth in the service provider vertical 
however  core enterprise spending and resulting revenue continued to lag as we saw these customers remaining cautious on significant it spending 
the  or million  decrease in revenue in europe was a result of decreased revenue from the northern european region 
the  or million  increase in revenue from the rest of the world  which includes africa  australia  canada  brazil  india  mexico and the united arab emirates  was primarily due to further market penetration in this region from our service provider and enterprise verticals 
we expect revenue from sales to customers outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
in accordance with united states export control regulations we do not sell or do business with countries subject to economic sanctions and export controls

the product gross profit percentage increased by three points from to for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to favorable product mix  with a shift towards higher margin products  such as g infinistream and software 
in addition  there was a decrease in the indirect manufacturing costs largely due to lower incentive compensation as well as lower product component costs 
average headcount in cost of product was for both years ended march  and service 
the  or thousand  decrease in cost of service revenue was primarily due to a thousand reduction in integration costs associated with the acquisition of network general  a thousand decrease in travel in our support and consulting groups and a thousand decrease in employee compensation 
these costs were partially offset by higher allocations due to increased headcount 
the  or million  increase in service gross profit corresponds with the  or million  increase in service revenue  as well as additional operating leverage from the reduced direct expenses 
average headcount in cost of service was and for the years ended march  and  respectively

the thousand increase in total sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to million in increased sales commissions as well as a thousand increase in other employee related expenses 
despite the decline in revenue  commissions increased due to incremental special incentive programs and commission expense on increased service bookings  including maintenance renewals for which some revenue will be recognized in future periods 
these were partially offset by a thousand decrease in travel expenses  a thousand decrease in expenses related to the netscout user conference  a thousand decrease in allocated overhead costs such as lower internal it spending  a thousand decrease in integration expenses as a result of the network general acquisition  a thousand decrease in rent and other office expenses as well a thousand reduction in sales meeting expenses

the  or million  decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a million decrease in professional fees  a million decrease in incentive compensation  a decrease of thousand relating to network general integration and acquisition related expenses and a thousand decrease in bad debt expense 
the decrease in professional fees was primarily due to the settlement of litigation in the prior year  as well as savings from entity consolidation and other cost reduction initiatives 
average headcount in general and administrative was for both fiscal years ended march  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships related to the acquisition of network general

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities consist of the following as of march  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   we had a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association  or keybank  which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit subject to a sublimit 
amounts outstanding under the facility bear interest at a floating interest rate dependent upon  at our election  libor or keybank s prime rate  in each case plus a margin  and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
under the agreement  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants which require that we maintain minimum certain amounts of liquidity  the most restrictive of which is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to and a maximum leverage ratio of less than to 
as of march   we were in compliance with such covenants 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by million from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  short and long term marketable securities increased in total by million 
our long term marketable securities include investments in auction rate securities valued at million at march  auction rate securities are publicly issued securities with long term maturities for which interest rates reset through a dutch auction in short term intervals  in the case of our securities every days 
this mechanism was structured to allow existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling at par value through the auction process 
the company invested in these securities as part of its cash management program 
historically  this auction process provided liquidity and supported a short term classification of these securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in february and continuing through march   auctions have failed resulting in a lack of short term liquidity for these securities  which has caused us to classify our auction rate securities within long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of march   our auction rate securities consisted of six positions issued by municipal agencies with a total par value of million and a current estimated market value totaling million 
the auction rate securities held by netscout at march  have maturity dates ranging from december through december as of march   these investments have investment grade ratings ranging from aaa to a 
these investments are collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the federal family education loan program and by monoline insurance companies 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in the auction process or other liquidity event occurs 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on the assumptions disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment  and we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market and economic conditions  including changes in market rates  the estimated timing until a liquidity event  the discount factor associated with illiquidity and the credit ratings of our securities 
there is no assurance as to when liquidity will return to this investment class  and therefore  we continue to monitor and evaluate these securities 
subsequent to year end we were notified that a total of million of these holdings were being redeemed at par value  providing liquidity for a portion of these securities 
based on our 
table of contents expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
cash and cash equivalents were impacted by the following year ending march  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary sources of operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended march  included net income of million  adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items of million  including depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense  deferred income taxes  inventory write downs and loss on disposal of fixed assets  a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from increased billings and a million increase in prepaid income taxes  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased billings  a million decrease in accrued compensation and other expense primarily due to a decrease in non sales incentive compensation based on company underperformance in the year ended march  the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities is attributable to net income improvement over the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary sources of operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended march  included net income of million  adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items of million  including depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense  deferred income taxes and inventory write downs  an million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to discontinuance of outsourcing the network general inventory and a million decrease in inventories  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased revenue and billing and the timing of cash collections and shipments 
the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities is attributable to net income improvement over the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary sources of operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended march  included a million increase in deferred revenue including incremental maintenance contract renewals from network general customers  a million decrease in accounts receivables  net of the effects of the acquisition of the network general business  as a result of additional sales and the timing of such sales within the fiscal year ended march   offset by a million increase in inventory due to purchases to support anticipated order flow 
net cash used in provided by investing activities 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  cash used in provided by investing activities reflects the purchase of marketable securities of million  million and million  respectively  offset by the proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities due to cash management activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the fiscal year ended march  includes thousand in capitalized software development costs 
the fiscal year ended march  includes cash used in the acquisition of network general of million  net of cash acquired in such transaction 
cash used in investing activities also includes capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for internal use software of thousand for the fiscal year ended march  represents costs of procurement and development of a new 
table of contents erp system that was implemented in august capital expenditures for fixed assets of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  represent an investment in our infrastructure as we prepared for future growth 
we anticipate that our investment in our infrastructure will grow in future quarters 
net cash used in provided by financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary outflow was due to the repayment of million of our long term debt with keybank which included a million excess cash flow payment  offset by million for the net issuance of common stock under stock plans and a tax benefit from stock options exercised of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary outflow was due to the repayment of million of our long term debt with keybank  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the amount of million and a tax benefit from stock options exercised of thousand 
net cash provided by financing activities was thousand during the fiscal year ended march  the primary source was proceeds received from the incurrence of long term debt with keybank in connection with the re financing of our senior secured floating rate notes  due in  totaling million net of deferred financing costs  offset by the repayments of long term debt totaling million which represents repayment of senior secured floating rate notes and the first principal payment on our long term debt with keybank 
cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  also included the exercise of stock options in the amount of million 
liquidity we believe that our cash balances  short term marketable securities classified as available for sale and future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies such as our acquisition of network general 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
at march   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the valuation of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at march  resulted in a liability balance of thousand  reflecting unfavorable contract rates in comparison to current market rates at this date  and an asset balance of thousand  reflecting favorable contract rates in comparison to current market rates 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a large multinational commercial bank  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material 
however  we cannot be assured that the financial institution will not be impacted by changes in the economic environment 
recent accounting standards fair value disclosures 
in january  the fasb issued amended standards requiring additional fair value disclosures 
the amended standards require disclosures of transfers in and out of levels i and ii of the fair value 
table of contents hierarchy  as well as requiring gross basis disclosures for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements within the level iii reconciliation which will replace the net presentation format 
additionally  the update clarifies the requirement to determine the level of disaggregation for fair value measurement disclosures and to disclose valuation techniques and inputs used for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements in either level ii or level iii 
we adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  except for the gross presentation of the level iii rollforward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal year for netscout 
because these new standards are related primarily to disclosures  their adoption has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in september  authoritative guidance on software enabled products was issued 
under this guidance  tangible products that contain software components that work together with the hardware to provide the essential functionality of the tangible product will be removed from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
these products will be accounted for under guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements that do not include software 
products that contain software only will continue to be accounted for under the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  we will allocate any discount in an arrangement proportionally across all hardware related deliverables using our best estimate of selling price  rather than under the residual method as described in our current revenue accounting policy footnote 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  fiscal year for netscout  and early adoption is permitted 
we are early adopting the new guidance on april  and do not expect its impact to be significant 
variable interest entities 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of qualifying special purpose entities 
this amendment contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this amendment also contains a new requirement that any term  transaction  or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity s status as a variable interest entity  a company s power over a variable interest entity  or a company s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying the amendment 
the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments 
the amendment is effective as of the beginning of an enterprise s first fiscal year beginning after november  fiscal year for netscout  and for interim periods within that first period  with earlier adoption prohibited 
the guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  since we do not have any variable interest entities and do not expect to have these entities at adoption 
transfers of financial assets 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this amendment will be effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after november  fiscal year for netscout  and in interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited 
the guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  since we do not have any special purpose entities and do not expect to have these entities at adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of illiquidity of auction rate securities  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the 
table of contents value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our long term marketable securities  which consist primarily of auction rate securities  are stated at fair value based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow calculations 
prior to february  these securities typically were stated at par value 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate  these securities are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  par value no longer approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
as a result of their illiquidity  we have recorded a temporary impairment at march  against the carrying value of our auction rate securities 
credit risk 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal obligations and student loan backed auction rate securities 
additional information regarding auction rate securities is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements held by netscout at march  at march  and periodically throughout the year  we have maintained cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits 
we limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution by evaluating the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we invest 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our term loan with keybank 
as of march   we owed million on this loan with a weighted average interest rate of effective december  until the next reset date 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of march  and should the current weighted average interest rate increase or decrease by  the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately thousand and thousand as of march  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and indian rupee 
the current exposures arise primarily from expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
netscout currently engages in foreign currency hedging activities in order to limit these exposures 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the valuation of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at march  resulted in a liability balance of thousand  reflecting unfavorable contract rates in comparison to current market rates at this date and an asset balance of thousand reflecting favorable rates in comparison to current market rates 
at march  we did not have any foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a multinational commercial bank 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
however  we cannot be assured that the financial institution will not be further impacted by the negative economic environment
