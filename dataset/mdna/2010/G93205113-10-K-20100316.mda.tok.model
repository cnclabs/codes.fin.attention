the drilling revenue per day includes the achievement of the bonus opportunity  but excludes mobilization revenues and revenue escalations included in the contract 
drilling fleet jackups a jackup rig is a mobile  self elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support and then the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations 
the design of our four jackup rigs is the baker marine pacific class these units are ultra premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to feet of water  a cantilever drilling floor  and a vertical drilling depth capacity of approximately  feet 
all of our jackup rigs were built at ppl shipyard ltd  pte ppl shipyard in singapore 
all four rigs were delivered on budget and on time 
drillships drillships are self propelled  dynamically positioned and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity 
the drillships that we will operate are being constructed by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering co  ltd 
dsme and are designed for drilling in water depths of up to  feet  with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to  feet 
the drillships hull design has a variable deck load of approximately  tons and measures feet long by feet wide 
we expect the drillships will be delivered on time and within budget 

table of contents the platinum explorer  an ultra deepwater drillship  is expected to be delivered in november we provide construction supervision for this drillship and will manage and operate it upon delivery 
for more information  see transactions with f capital platinum explorer transaction 
we also have construction management contracts for two other drillships  the dragonquest and cobalt explorer  which are owned by valencia drilling corporation and north pole drilling corporation  respectively  affiliates of f capital 
the dragonquest is expected to be completed in july we will operate both the platinum explorer and the dragonquest under management agreements upon delivery 
although we expect to manage the cobalt explorer under a similar arrangement  we are currently in discussions with north pole drilling corporation to amend the performance obligations of both parties under the construction management agreement to correspond with the deferred construction of the cobalt explorer 
for more information  see transactions with f capital drillship construction supervision agreements 
semisubmersibles semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower hulls are below the water surface during drilling operations 
the design of the two semisubmersibles that we will manage is the moss maritime cs mkii 
these drilling units are dynamically positioned and are designed to be capable of operating in harsh environmental conditions 
these semisubmersibles are designed for drilling in water depths of up to  feet  with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to  feet 
the semisubmersibles are expected to be delivered in december and the third quarter of for more information see submersible management arrangements 
our strengths premium fleet 
our fleet is comprised of ultra premium high specification drilling units  including jackup rigs  drillships and semisubmersibles 
in particular  we believe our drilling units are ultra premium due to their ability to work in deeper water depths as well as their enhanced operational efficiency and technical capabilities when compared to the current global fleet  which is primarily comprised of older drilling units using dated technology 
we expect that our drilling units will have greater drilling capabilities than older drilling units  which we believe will allow them to enjoy higher utilization  dayrates and margins 
experienced management and operational team 
we benefit from our management team  which has extensive experience and an average of years in the drilling industry  including international and domestic public company experience involving numerous acquisitions and debt and equity financings 
we have also hired experienced operating personnel that are responsible for the day to day operation of our drilling units 
contract backlog 
our owned fleet has total contract backlog of approximately billion and our managed fleet has a contract backlog of approximately billion 
we believe that the backlog for our jackup rigs will provide us with sufficient operating cash flow until our deepwater units are delivered 
three of our deepwater units have long term contracts  ranging from five to eight years with two contracts commencing in the first quarter of and one in the third quarter of proven operational track record 
our operational management team has a proven track record of successfully managing  constructing  marketing and operating offshore drilling units  having previously managed significant drilling fleets for some of our competitors 
as a result  our jackup fleet has experienced approximately productive time while in service 
we believe this level of operational efficiency is above average for the industry and is exceptional for new jackup rigs on their first contracts after leaving the shipyard 
additionally  our in house team of engineers and construction personnel has overseen complex construction projects 
as a result  all of our jackup rigs have been delivered on budget and on time 

table of contents our strategy our strategy is to increase shareholder value by capitalizing on customer demand for higher specification units 
high specification state of the art drilling units are better suited to meet the requirements of customers for drilling in deepwater  complex geological formations  and for drilling horizontally 
a majority of all the bids we participated in for jackup rigs during required high specification units 
aside from their drilling capabilities  we believe that customers generally prefer new drilling units because of improved safety features  and lower downtime for maintenance 
new drilling units are also generally preferred by crews  which makes it easier to hire high quality operating personnel 
focusing on international markets 
we have been able to successfully deploy and operate our rigs in some of the most active international oil and natural gas producing regions 
we believe that exposure to certain international markets with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies will increase the predictability of our cash flows because those markets have exhibited less cyclicality than the us gulf of mexico market 
we also believe that our internationally diverse platform reduces our exposure to a single market 
through the continued growth of our presence in asia and west africa  we intend to capitalize on our existing infrastructure to better serve our customers and increase our contract backlog 
expanding our deepwater exposure 
in recent years  there has been increased emphasis on exploration in deeper waters due  in part  to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective 
we believe that the water depth capability of our ultra deepwater drilling units is a key component for our customers in determining suitability for a particular drilling project  and should provide us with significant advantages in obtaining long term deepwater drilling contracts in the future 
developing key relationships 
we are focused on developing relationships with national oil companies  major international oil companies and large independents  which we believe will allow us to obtain longer term contracts to build our backlog of business when dayrates and operating margins justify entering into such contracts 
we believe that our existing relationships with these companies have contributed to our strong existing backlog 
we believe that longer term contracts increase revenue visibility and mitigate some of the volatility in cash flows caused by cyclical market downturns 
identify and pursue acquisition opportunities 
we plan to continue to grow through acquisitions of assets and other offshore drilling companies 
we believe our current construction management arrangements give us unique opportunities to evaluate an attractive pool of newbuild  high specification drilling units for possible acquisition 
as part of our acquisition strategy  we anticipate raising additional debt and equity capital which may  at times  initially increase our overall leverage or dilute our shareholders  but on a basis to provide attractive returns to shareholders 
our industry the offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling  workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling rigs 
historically  the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time 
as is common throughout the oilfield services industry  offshore contract drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas 
sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and  as a result  greater demand for our services 
the recent volatility in the financial markets led to a global decline in economic activity and increased the uncertainty of the future economic outlook 
the decline in economic activity resulted in a worldwide 
table of contents decrease in demand for oil and natural gas and a steep decline in commodity prices which caused many oil and gas companies to curtail planned capital spending 
given the volatility in the financial markets and general economic uncertainty  it is difficult to predict to what extent these events will affect our business in and our ability to grow and implement our strategy 
markets offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another 
the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions 
however  significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long term because of rig mobility 
the offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water ft  midwater ft  deepwater  ft 
and ultra deepwater  ft the global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups 
our jackup fleet is focused on the long legged ft high specification market 
the drillships and semisubmersibles that we operate and have agreements to operate are focused on the deepwater and ultra deepwater segments which have been very strong in recent years as demand for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs has exceeded supply 
customers our customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies  government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers 
in  three customers  pearl oil thailand ltd  seadragon limited and foxtrot international ldc accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our consolidated revenue 
mandarin accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
drilling contracts the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with contracts traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
the rigs technical capabilities  availability  age and pricing are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
other key factors include a contractor s reputation for service  safety record  environmental record  technical and engineering support and long term relationships with national and international oil companies 
oil and natural gas well drilling contracts are carried out on a dayrate  footage or turnkey basis 
under dayrate contracts  we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
in addition  dayrate contracts usually provide for a reduced dayrate  or a lump sum amount for mobilizing the rig to the well location  or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control 
a dayrate drilling contract generally covers either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or has a stated term 
these contracts may generally be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is damaged  destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  drilling contracts with certain customers may be cancelable  without cause  with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments 
in some instances  the dayrate contract term may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time at fixed or mutually agreed terms  including dayrates 
we anticipate that we will contract our services on a dayrate basis 
however  market conditions may require us to enter into other contracts that provide for payment on a footage basis  whereby we will be paid a fixed 
table of contents amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well  or enter into turnkey contracts  whereby we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and to bear some of the well equipment costs 
compared with dayrate contracts  footage and turnkey contracts involve a higher degree of risk 
a customer is more likely to seek to cancel or renegotiate its contract during periods of depressed market conditions 
we could be required to pay penalties if our contracts with our customers are canceled due to excessive downtime or operational problems 
suspension of drilling contracts results in the reduction in or loss of dayrates for the period of the suspension 
if our customers cancel some of our significant contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time  it could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 
our drilling contracts are the result of negotiations with our customers  and most contracts are awarded upon competitive bidding 
our drilling contracts generally contain the following commercial terms i contract duration extending over a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill one or more wells  ii term extension options in favor of our customer  generally upon advance notice to us  at mutually agreed  indexed or fixed rates  iii provisions permitting early termination of the contract a if the drilling unit is lost or destroyed or b by the customer if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of major equipment  unsatisfactory performance  force majeure events beyond our control and the control of the customer or other specified conditions  iv provisions permitting the early termination of the contract by the customer without cause  generally exercisable upon advance notice and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us  v payment of compensation to us generally in us dollars although some contracts require a portion of the compensation to be paid in local currency on a dayrate while the drilling unit is operating under contract lower rates or no compensation generally apply during periods of equipment breakdown and repair or in the event operations are suspended or interrupted by other specified conditions  some of which may be beyond our control  vi payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit  including crew labor and incidental rig supply costs  and vii provisions allowing us to recover certain labor and other operating cost increases from our customers through dayrate adjustments or otherwise 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive 
demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis 
during depressed market conditions  pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
rig availability  capabilities  age and each contractor s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination 
operators also may consider crew experience  rig location and efficiency 
we believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future 
certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do  which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization  compete more effectively on the basis of price  build new rigs or acquire existing rigs 
our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller  locally owned companies 
competition for offshore rigs is usually on a global basis  as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved  at a cost that is sometimes substantial  from one region to another in response to demand 

table of contents insurance the contract drilling industry is subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including blowouts and well fires  which could cause personal injury  suspend drilling operations  or seriously damage or destroy the equipment involved 
offshore drilling operations are also subject to hazards particular to marine operations including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
our current marine insurance package covers certain exposures  including physical damage  war risks  liability for control of well events and loss of hire insurance and has a million per occurrence physical damage deductible 
we also maintain insurance for cargo  auto liability  non owned aviation  protection and indemnity  general liability and similar potential liabilities 
these policies have significantly lower deductibles 
transactions with f capital platinum explorer transaction purchase of our interest in the platinum explorer in september  mandarin  which was wholly owned by f capital  entered into a shipbuilding contract with dsme for the construction of the platinum explorer 
in march  we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the platinum explorer from mandarin 
in november  we agreed with f capital to restructure our ownership interest in the platinum explorer through the purchase of a ownership interest in mandarin from f capital for total consideration of approximately million in cash and issuance of warrants to purchase up to  of our ordinary shares 
the million that was previously paid to mandarin and f capital pursuant to an interim agreement was credited toward the cash purchase price at the time of the restructuring  leaving a balance of approximately million 
in order for us to fund the balance of the purchase price  f capital agreed to exercise warrants  which were issued in connection with our acquisition of offshore group investment limited ogil in june  to acquire million ordinary shares  and we agreed to use the proceeds from the exercise to pay the remaining balance of the cash purchase price 
as of december   f capital has completed the exercise of these warrants and we have paid the balance of the purchase price for our interest in mandarin 
f capital has commenced the process of updating mandarin s share registry to reflect our ownership interest in mandarin 
as the exercise of the warrants was contingent upon our agreement to fund the acquisition and issue the additional warrants  we treated the transactions as one integrated transaction with a fair value of approximately million 
we entered into a shareholders agreement with f capital with respect to mandarin 
in the shareholders agreement  we and f capital agreed that  among other things  there would be five directors on the board of mandarin  three of which appointed by f capital  and two of which appointed by us 
a meeting of the board of directors of mandarin was recently held with our representatives and those of f capital in attendance 
in the shareholders agreement we and f capital also agreed to endeavor to obtain financing for the final payment due to dsme  and if such financing is not available  each party will provide funds in accordance with its respective ownership interests in mandarin 
payment for the platinum explorer the total shipyard construction price for the platinum explorer is approximately million to be paid in four installments and the balance of approximately million upon delivery  which will be an obligation of both us and f capital based upon our respective ownership percentages 
the first two installment payments were made to dsme and f capital agreed to make the third and fourth installment payments 
dsme has agreed to defer the third and fourth installment payments under the construction contract to june  the deferral agreement provides for the payment of interest at the rate of per annum on the deferred obligations and protection against fluctuations in exchange rates  f capital is responsible for the additional interest and exchange rate fluctuations 
we estimate that an additional million of non shipyard capital expenditures is 
table of contents required to equip and commission the drillship for service 
we have agreed with f capital to provide these additional funds in accordance with our respective ownership interests in mandarin we have been paying the shipyard oversight costs and procuring equipment and f capital has been reimbursing us for its share of these costs 
drillship construction supervision agreements we have construction supervision agreements that entitle us to payments for supervising the construction of the platinum explorer  dragonquest and cobalt explorer 
the counterparties in each of these agreements are affiliates of f capital 
we own a interest in mandarin  which owns the platinum explorer  an ultra deepwater drillship 
for more information  see platinum explorer transaction above 
during the construction of each of these drillships  these agreements entitle us to receive a fee of million per drillship annually  prorated to the extent construction is completed during the year 
these agreements may be terminated by either party upon the provision of notice 
as of december   the affiliates of f capital that are parties to these construction supervision contracts have been paying us amounts due under the contracts  except for north pole drilling corporation  the affiliate of f capital that is constructing the cobalt explorer 
in june  north pole drilling and dsme agreed to suspend commencement of construction activities on the cobalt explorer for one year 
we are currently under discussions with north pole drilling  to amend the performance obligations of us and f capital under the construction supervision agreement to correspond with the proposed deferred construction of the cobalt explorer  and to determine the appropriate amount payable by north pole drilling for construction services rendered by us in  which we currently estimate to be approximately million 
drillship management services agreements we have three management services agreements that entitle us to payments for the management of the platinum explorer  dragonquest and cobalt explorer 
our counterparty in each of these agreements is an affiliate of f capital 
we own a interest in the entity which owns the platinum explorer 
once each drillship is operational  these agreements entitle us to receive a fixed fee per day plus a performance fee based on the operational performance of each respective drillship 
additionally  we will receive a marketing fee for every charter agreement we secure on behalf of one of these drillships 
unless the drillships are operating under contract  the counterparty to these agreements may terminate their obligations under the relevant agreement if any of the following occur i we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement after being given notice and time to cure  ii we go into liquidation or cease to carry on our business  iii the relevant drillship is damaged to the point of being inoperable  or iv the relevant drillship is sold and no outstanding payments are owed to us 
semisubmersible management services agreements we have agreements to manage the construction and operations of the semi i and the semi ii 
these arrangements are for an indefinite term  and continue until terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the arrangement 
pursuant to these arrangements  we are entitled to receive a fee of million per year per unit  payable in monthly installments  while the semisubmersibles are under construction 
once the semi i is operational  we are entitled to a fixed fee per day and a performance fee based on the operational performance of the unit 
during the construction of the semisubmersibles  the owner may terminate the arrangements upon the occurrence of any certain specified events 
however  either party may terminate the arrangements at any time on seven days notice 
the semi i will likely be delivered after the scheduled drilling contract delivery date which will give the customer the right to terminate its arrangement with the owner of the semi i  however  the customer has given no indication that it intends to do so

risk factors 
in evaluating our business  you should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our securities may decline 
risks related to our business our business is difficult to evaluate due to our limited operating history and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges 
we have had a limited operating history 
our business is difficult to evaluate due to a lack of operational history  and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges 
because we have a limited operating history  you may not be able to evaluate our future prospects accurately 
our prospects will be primarily dependent on our ability to obtain customer drilling contracts for our drilling units and other factors 
in addition  our prospects will also be dependent on the success of our joint venture for the platinum explorer  a deepwater drillship  which is currently under construction  including the ability of us and our joint venture partner  f capital  to successfully finance our respective portions of the construction cost 
if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges  our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
a small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers 
during the fiscal year ended december   three customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our revenue 
our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any one of these customers interrupt or curtail their activities  fail to pay for the services that have been performed  terminate their contracts  fail to renew their existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts and we are unable to enter into contracts with new customers on comparable terms 
the loss of any of our significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit risks of our key customers  including certain affiliated companies  and certain other third parties  and nonpayment by these customers and other parties could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers  including certain companies owned by or associated with our affiliates 
as of december   affiliates of f capital owed us approximately million in connection with services rendered under construction supervision arrangements 
any material nonpayment or nonperformance by these entities  other key customers and certain other third parties could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if any key customers and other parties default on their obligations to us  our financial results and condition could be adversely affected 
furthermore  some of these customers and other parties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks 
a material or extended decline in expenditures by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies due to a decline or volatility in oil and natural gas prices  a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas  or other factors  would adversely affect our business 
our business depends on the level of activity in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production expenditures of our customers 
oil and natural gas prices and customers expectations of potential changes in 
table of contents these prices significantly affect this level of activity 
commodity prices are affected by numerous factors  including the following changes in the global economic conditions  including the continuation of the current recession  the demand for oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  expectations regarding future prices  advances in exploration  development and production technology  the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves  the level of production in non opec countries  domestic and international tax policies  the development and exploitation of alternative fuels  weather  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves  and the worldwide military and political environment  uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in significant oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism 
oil and natural gas prices were at historically high levels until experiencing a sharp decline during the second half of and the first quarter of although oil and natural gas prices have recovered somewhat from their twelve month lows  this decline in commodity prices has caused companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas to cancel or curtail their drilling programs  or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons  including their lack of success in exploration efforts 
a prolonged continuation of the current low level of demand for our services  or any further reduction in the demand for drilling services  may materially erode dayrates and utilization rates for drilling units  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and could have a significant negative impact on the market price of our securities 
construction projects are subject to risks  including delays and cost overruns  which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy we may contract from time to time for the construction of drilling units or may enter into agreements to manage the construction of drilling units for others 
currently  we are overseeing and managing the construction of three ultra deepwater drillships and two ultra deepwater semisubmersibles 
our construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project  including costs or delays resulting from the following unexpected long delivery times for  or shortages of  key equipment  parts and materials  shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work  unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment  labor and raw materials  particularly steel  unforeseen design and engineering problems  unanticipated actual or purported change orders  work stoppages  
table of contents latent damages or deterioration to hull  equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions  failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes  disputes with shipyards and suppliers  delays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the completion of projects  financial or other difficulties at shipyards  adverse weather conditions  and inability to obtain required permits or approvals 
any delays could subject us to penalties for such failure 
if we experience delays and costs overruns in the construction of these drilling units due to certain of the factors listed above  it could also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our drilling contracts are generally short term  and we will experience reduced profitability if customers reduce activity levels  terminate or seek to renegotiate drilling contracts  or if market conditions dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage or turnkey basis  rather than on a dayrate basis 
many drilling contracts are short term  and oil and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to downward changes in oil and natural gas prices 
due to the short term nature of most of our contracts  a decline in market conditions can quickly affect our business if customers reduce their levels of operations 
during depressed market conditions  a customer may no longer need a unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable unit at a lower dayrate 
as a result  customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing drilling contracts or avoid their obligations under those contracts 
in addition  our customers may have the right to terminate  or may seek to renegotiate  existing contracts if we experience downtime  operational problems above the contractual limit or safety related issues  if the drilling unit is a total loss  if the drilling unit is not delivered to the customer within the period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances  which include events beyond the control of either party 
some of our current contracts  and some contracts that we may enter into in the future  may include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without cause  with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments 
in addition  we could be required to pay penalties  which could be material  if some of these contracts are terminated due to downtime  operational problems or failure to deliver 
some of the contracts with customers that we enter into in the future may be cancellable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty  which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
early termination of a contract may result in a drilling unit being idle for an extended period of time 
the likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness 
currently  our drilling contracts are dayrate contracts  where we charge a fixed rate per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
while we plan to continue to perform services on a dayrate basis  market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage basis  where we are paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well  or enter into turnkey contracts  whereby we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and bear some of the well equipment costs 
these types of contracts are more risky than a dayrate contract as we would be subject to downhole geologic conditions in the well that cannot always be accurately determined and subject us to greater risks associated with equipment and downhole tool failures 
unfavorable downhole geologic conditions and equipment and downhole tool failures may result in significant cost increases or may result in a decision to abandon a well project which would result in us not being able to invoice revenues for providing services 
any such termination or renegotiation of contracts and unfavorable costs increases or loss of revenue could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operations 

table of contents our business is affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil and natural gas industry 
recent economic data indicates the rate of economic growth worldwide has declined significantly from the growth rates experienced in recent years 
the consequences of the recent recession include a lower level of economic activity  uncertainty regarding energy and commodity prices and reduced demand for oil and natural gas 
in addition  current economic conditions may cause many oil and natural gas production companies to further reduce or delay expenditures in order to reduce costs  which in turn may cause a further reduction in the demand for drilling services 
if the recession is prolonged or worsens  our business and financial condition may be adversely impacted and could become more vulnerable to further adverse general economic and industry conditions 
the current worldwide financial and credit crisis has led to an extended worldwide economic recession that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
the current worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets has led to an extended worldwide economic recession 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
benchmark crude prices peaked at over per barrel in july and then declined dramatically to approximately per barrel at year end during  the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated between the mid s per barrel and low s per barrel 
demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the near term levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our long lived assets 
our industry is highly competitive  cyclical and subject to intense price competition 
due to our lack of operating history  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive  and contracts have traditionally been awarded on a competitive bid basis 
the technical capabilities  availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
other key factors include a contractor s reputation for service  safety record  environmental record  technical and engineering support and long term relationships with national and international oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger  more diverse fleets  longer operating histories with established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time  experienced in house technical and engineering support departments and long term relationships with customers 
this provides our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract our drilling units on favorable terms  if at all  and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
additionally  we are at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that are better capitalized because they are in a better position to weather the effects of a downturn in our industry 
the offshore contract drilling industry  historically  has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess supply and low dayrates 
many 
table of contents offshore drilling units are highly mobile 
competitors may move drilling units from region to region in response to changes in demand 
it is currently estimated that newly constructed jackup rigs will be entered into service between now and december periods of low demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time 
our lack of operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and  as a result  our drilling units may become idle 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates  or extended idle time  could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of the drilling units may not be recoverable 
new technology and or products may cause us to become less competitive 
the offshore contract drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling techniques and services using new technologies  some of which may be subject to patent protection 
as competitors and others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
further  we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost 
most of our competitors have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that will allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technology or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
thus  our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technology may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any ban of offshore drilling by any city  state  or nation  or by any governing body may have a material adverse effect on our business 
events in recent years have heightened environmental and regulatory concerns about the oil and natural gas industry 
from time to time  governing bodies may propose legislation that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas 
to date  no proposals which would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in our areas of operation have been enacted into law 
however  governing bodies may enact such laws in the future 
if laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our expected areas of operation  we could be materially and adversely affected 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling obligations under our debt obligations 
as of december   we and our subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis  had approximately million of long term debt  which is secured by all of our jackup rigs and a substantial portion of our assets 
our high level of indebtedness  and the terms of the agreements that govern such indebtedness  may have important consequences on your investment and our business such as requiring us and our subsidiaries to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the debt  which would reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other investments  which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy  heighten our vulnerability to downturns in business or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and result in higher interest expense if we have outstanding floating rate borrowings 

table of contents each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability 
we may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
if we incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that we now face would intensify and could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
the agreements governing our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
the agreements governing our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries contain numerous restrictions on our activities  including covenants that limit our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock  enter into drilling contracts without lender approval  create or incur liens  pay dividends  redeem subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments  transfer or sell assets  incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries  consummate a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  engage in businesses other than a business that is the same or similar to our current business and reasonably related businesses  and take or omit to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing the indebtedness 
these restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business  and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted 
we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility 
we cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements  or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all 
the breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the agreements governing our debt 
an event of default under any of these agreements would permit some of the lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable 
if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our debt  there could be a default under the terms of these agreements  which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds 
if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our current and future agreements governing our debt  there could be a default under the terms of these agreements which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that have been borrowed 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants  including meeting financial ratios and tests  may be affected by events beyond our control 
if a default occurs under these agreements  the holders of the debt could accelerate the outstanding debt and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events occur  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may not be able to find alternative financing 
even if we could obtain alternative financing  such financing might not be on terms that are 
table of contents favorable or acceptable 
if we were unable to repay amounts borrowed  the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding 
to service our indebtedness and other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on  or refinance  our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
a significant reduction in the operating cash flows  including as a result of changes in general economic conditions  timing of contracts or payments  legislative or regulatory conditions  increased competition or other events beyond our control  could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs  we may be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing indebtedness  seeking additional equity capital or any combination of the foregoing 
we cannot assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay future cash flows 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the value of our securities 
in addition  if we default in the payment of amounts due on any current indebtedness  it would give rise to an event of default under our agreements governing our indebtedness  and could lead to the possible acceleration of amounts due under any of our outstanding indebtedness 
in the event of any acceleration  there can be no assurance that we will have enough cash to repay our outstanding indebtedness 
we have substantial obligations to fund contracts and other arrangements related to the construction of the platinum explorer 
if we fail to meet these obligations or construction of the platinum explorer is not completed  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
we are not the majority owner of mandarin  however we are responsible for securing financing for our portion of the construction costs of  and related capital expenditures for  the platinum explorer 
we have funding obligations related to the construction of the platinum explorer of approximately million due upon delivery of the drilling unit in the fourth quarter of this amount represents our pro rata portion of the final payments to the shipyard 
in addition  we have funding obligations related to non shipyard pre delivery capital expenditures for the platinum explorer of approximately million  which represents our pro rata portion of these costs 
the final terms and availability of any financing for these obligations will be determined by  among other factors  financial market conditions in  the creditworthiness of mandarin  our creditworthiness  the creditworthiness of f capital  our joint venture partner  and drilling industry conditions 
under the terms of the shareholders agreement  f capital is solely responsible for funding the remaining pre delivery shipyard payments for the platinum explorer 
the first two installment payments were made to dsme and dsme has agreed to defer the third and fourth installment payments under the construction contract to june  the deferral agreement provides for the payment of interest at the rate of per annum on the deferred obligations and protection against fluctuations in exchange rates  f capital is responsible for the additional interest and exchange rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that f capital will make the payment to dsme when due on behalf of mandarin pursuant to the terms of the deferral 
there can be no assurance that we or f capital will be able to successfully obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all  on behalf of the joint venture 
if we are unable to obtain  arrange or complete the financing for our portion of the final construction payment for the drillship  we will be in breach of the shareholder agreement and could be liable for damages to f capital 
in addition  we could lose all or a portion of our investment in mandarin  valued at million as of 
table of contents december  even if we are able to meet our obligations under the shareholder agreement  f capital may not perform  or the drillship could be delayed or otherwise not delivered by the shipyard 
if platinum explorer is delayed  cancelled or not delivered as expected for any reason upon completion of construction  we will not be able to deliver it to the customer under the drilling contract entered into and for which we provide a performance guarantee 
in such event  we will need to find a replacement unit that is acceptable to our customer 
if we are unable to deliver an acceptable replacement  we will lose any anticipated income from the employment of this unit and may be required to pay substantial liquidated damages to our customer 
should we become liable under the performance guarantee  we could be held liable for the customer s potential damages including  but not limited to  any increase in rates between our current drilling contract with the customer and any substitute drilling contract they may obtain 
if we were to become liable to f capital  lose all or a portion of our investment  including any anticipated revenue from the operation of this drillship  or become liable to our customer for liquidated damages  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if we make payments on behalf of f capital in connection with the construction or other costs for the platinum explorer  our financial condition would be adversely affected and there is no guarantee that f capital would reimburse us for payments we make on the their behalf 
for more information  see transactions with f capital platinum explorer transaction 
failure to obtain deliveries of the drilling units may have a material and adverse effect on our business 
we have construction supervision arrangements in place for the platinum explorer  dragonquest  cobalt explorer  semi i and semi ii  but we are not a party to the construction contracts for these drilling units and do not have control over any arrangements between the owner and the shipyard 
although we have secured drilling and management contracts for some of these drilling units  these units may not be completed  completed in a timely manner  delivered to us upon completion of construction or acceptable to our customers 
if we are unable to deliver these units or find acceptable replacements  we may be required to pay damages to our customers  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects will be materially adversely affected 
our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions  fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire  or are unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of assets or businesses that we believe to be complementary to our drilling operations is an important component of our business strategy 
we believe that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time  and that any such acquisition could be significant 
at any given time  discussions with one or more potential sellers may be at different stages 
however  any such discussions may not result in the consummation of an acquisition transaction  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisitions 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our ordinary shares 
our business is capital intensive and any such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash 
we may need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings to execute our growth strategy and to fund acquisitions 
adequate sources of capital may not be available when needed on favorable terms 
if we raise additional capital by issuing additional equity securities  existing shareholders may be diluted 
if our capital resources are insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to fund acquisitions  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could harm our business 
any future acquisitions could present a number of risks  including the risk of using management time and resources to pursue acquisitions that are not successfully completed  the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations  
table of contents the risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely  and the risk of diversion of management s attention from existing operations or other priorities 
if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other operations or assets  our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be unable to implement an important component of our business strategy successfully 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
there may be limits to our ability to mobilize drilling units between geographic markets and the time and costs of such drilling unit mobilizations may be material to our business 
the offshore contract drilling market is generally a global market as drilling units may be mobilized from one market to another market 
however  geographic markets can  from time to time  have material fluctuations in costs and risks as the ability to mobilize drilling units can be impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  governmental regulation and customs practices  the significant costs to move a drilling unit  availability of tow boats  weather  political instability  civil unrest  military actions  and the technical capability of the drilling units to operate in various environments 
any increase in the supply of drilling units in the geographic areas in which we operate  whether through new construction  refurbishment or conversion of drilling units from other uses  remobilization or changes in the law or its application  could increase competition and result in lower dayrates and or utilization  which would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  while a drilling unit is being mobilized from one geographic market to another  we may not be paid by the customer for the time that the drilling unit is out of service 
also  we may mobilize the drilling unit to another geographic market without a customer contract which will result in increased operations cost 
operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
we do not expect operating and maintenance costs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrates 
however  costs for operating a drilling unit are generally fixed or only semi variable regardless of the dayrate being earned 
in addition  should the drilling units incur idle time between contracts  we would typically maintain the crew to prepare the drilling unit for its next contract and would not reduce costs to correspond to the decrease in revenue 
during times of moderate activity  reductions in costs may not be immediate as the crew may be required to prepare the drilling units for stacking  after which time the crew will be reduced to a level necessary to maintain the drilling unit in working condition with the extra crew members assigned to active drilling units or dismissed 
in addition  as drilling units are mobilized from one geographic location to another  the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized 
we are a holding company  and are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
we currently conduct our operations through  and most of our assets are owned by  our subsidiaries 
our operating income and cash flow are generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  cash we obtain from our subsidiaries is the principal source of funds necessary to meet our obligations 
contractual provisions or laws  as well as our subsidiaries financial condition  operating requirements and debt requirements  may limit our ability to obtain cash from subsidiaries that we require to pay our expenses or meet our current or future debt service obligations 
applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to us by subsidiaries to further taxation 

table of contents the inability to transfer cash from our subsidiaries may mean that  even though we may have sufficient resources on a consolidated basis to meet our obligations  respectively  we may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from our subsidiaries to meet such obligations 
likewise  we may not be able to make necessary transfers from our subsidiaries in order to provide funds for the payment of our obligations  for which we are or may become responsible under the terms of the governing agreements of our indebtedness 
the terms of certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness as described under description of indebtedness also place restrictions on our cash balance and require us to maintain reserves of cash which could inhibit our ability to meet our obligations 
a payment default by us  or any of our subsidiaries  on any debt instruments would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of some of our key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 
our future operational performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of our management as well as marketing  sales and operations personnel 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and further motivate highly skilled management  marketing  sales and operations personnel 
we may experience intense competition for personnel  and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain key employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 
failure to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers or an increase in labor costs could hurt our operations 
we require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services to  and support for  our drilling units 
in periods of increasing activity and when the number of operating units in our areas of operation increases  either because of new construction  re activation of idle units or the mobilization of units into the region  shortages of qualified personnel could arise  creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing 
the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel also could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work 
in addition  our ability to expand operations depends in part upon our ability to increase the size of the skilled labor force 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification requirements of  and preparing for the auditor attestation under  section as a result  we have incurred additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
while we have been able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate in the future to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  we may be susceptible to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities 
customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us 
consistent with standard industry practice  our customers generally assume and indemnify us against well control and subsurface risks under our dayrate contracts 
these risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well  such as blowout or cratering  the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution 
we 
table of contents may not be able to obtain agreements from customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks 
additionally  even if our customers agree to indemnify us  there can be no assurance that they will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all of these risks 
our business involves numerous operating hazards  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses 
our operations will be subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punchthroughs  craterings  fires and pollution 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling or production operations  claims by the operator  severe damage to  or destruction of  the property and equipment involved  injury or death to drilling unit personnel and environmental damage 
we may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of drilling unit personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal operating conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages 
in addition  our operations will be subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our drilling units could be damaged by high winds  turbulent seas  or unstable sea bottom conditions which could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until such damages are repaired 
damage to the environment could result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
we may also be subject to property  environmental and other damage claims by oil and natural gas companies and other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas 
insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
moreover  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our drilling units  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurs 
as a result of the number of catastrophic events in the contract offshore industry in recent years  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and increased restrictions on coverage and have made other coverages  such as gulf of mexico windstorm coverage  unavailable 
while we have  and believe we can maintain  reasonable policy limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with financially sound insurers  we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur related to our property  plant or equipment  or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages 
when any of our coverage expires  we cannot guarantee that adequate replacement coverage will be available  offered at reasonable prices  or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness 
the occurrence of an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our drilling units could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or company liability was to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages 

table of contents our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages 
many aspects of our operations are affected by governmental laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling and well servicing industries  including those requiring us to control the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
countries where we operate have environmental laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants and protection of the environment in connection with operations 
additionally  any operations and activities in the united states and its territorial waters will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the oil pollution act of  the outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and even criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit our operations 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
the application of these requirements  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and natural gas could materially limit future contract drilling opportunities or materially increase our costs 
in addition  we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and regulations 
compliance with  or a breach of  environmental and safety laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to foreign  federal  state and local regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or other governmental approvals  control the discharge of materials into the environment  require the removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
the application of these requirements  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in tax laws  treaties or regulations  effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  treaties and regulations  both internationally and domestically 
tax laws  treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation 
consequently  we are subject to changing tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate 
our income tax expense is based upon the interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred 
a change in these tax laws  treaties or regulations  or in the interpretation thereof  could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings 
if any country successfully challenges our income tax filings based on our structure there  or if we otherwise lose a material dispute  our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our international operations are subject to additional political  economic  and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations 
a primary component of our business strategy is to operate in international oil and natural gas producing areas 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries  including political  social and economic instability  war and acts of terrorism  potential seizure  expropriation or nationalization of assets  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnappings  piracy  increased operating costs  complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations  repudiation  modification or renegotiation of contracts  limitations on insurance coverage  such as war risk coverage in certain areas  import export quotas  confiscatory taxation  work stoppages  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  wage and price controls  imposition of trade barriers  imposition or changes in enforcement of local content laws  restrictions on currency or capital repatriations  currency fluctuations and devaluations  and other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control 
our financial condition and results of operations could be susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in the particular country or region in which we are active 
additionally  we may experience currency exchange losses where  at some future date  revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not hedge exposure to a foreign currency 
we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
many governments favor or effectively require that drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may result in inefficiencies or put us at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts against local competitors 
our contract drilling operations will be subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and natural gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of units and other equipment 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their 
table of contents countries 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so 
operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries  which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
despite our training and compliance program  we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or agents 
violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that united states laws and regulations prohibit us from using 
in order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions  we utilize local agents and seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance  if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  including actions taken by our agents and our strategic or local partners  even though our agents and partners are not subject to the fcpa  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to ordinary shares because f capital holds a significant interest in us  the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions may be limited 
as of february   f capital beneficially owns approximately of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis 
f capital is owned by one of our directors 
under cayman islands law and our organizational documents  the holder of a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares may elect all of our directors at any shareholder meeting 
in addition  the holder of a majority of our outstanding shares may  at any time  execute a consent to remove our directors and replace them with its nominee 
accordingly  f capital has the ability to exert significant influence on all matters that might be submitted to our shareholders for a vote  including matters such as the election of our directors  control over our business  policies and affairs 
additional sales of our ordinary shares or warrants by f capital  or our employees  or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise  could cause the price of our securities to decline 
if f capital sells a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the future  the market price of our ordinary shares could decline 
the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect 
execution of our business strategy will require substantial additional capital 
to fulfill these capital requirements  we could issue additional ordinary shares  which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of our ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
if we were to include ordinary shares in a registration statement initiated by us  those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our ordinary shares 

table of contents our related party transactions with f capital and its affiliates may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect us 
we have entered into and may  in the future  enter into various transactions and agreements with f capital and its affiliates 
f capital has no fiduciary duty to make decisions in our best interest 
f capital is entitled to vote our ordinary shares in accordance with its own interests  which may be contrary to our and your interests and f capital and its other affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and are not obligated to offer us business opportunities or to offer to sell additional assets to us 
we believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with f capital are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties 
however  these relationships could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and f capital or its affiliates 
the appearance of conflicts  even if such conflicts do not materialize  might adversely affect the public s perception of us  as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business 
in addition  conflicts of interest may arise between us and f capital and its affiliates 
f capital may favor its own interests over our and your interests 
the acquisition of or more of our ordinary shares by f capital would trigger a change of control event under certain of our indebtedness 
as of february   f capital beneficially owned approximately upon the occurrence of specified change of control events  including the acquisition of more than of our ordinary shares by f capital  under the indenture governing our senior secured notes described under liquidity and capital resources  we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase 
any of our future debt agreements may contain acceleration rights upon a change of control 
however  it is possible that we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of notes or repayment of any other future indebtedness or that other of our debt may not allow such repurchases 
any of our future debt agreements may also limit our ability to purchase the notes until all such future debt is paid in full 
if we fail to repurchase any notes submitted in a change of control offer  it would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which in turn would constitute a default under our existing debt agreements 
in addition  the occurrence of a change of control would also constitute an event of default under our existing debt agreements 
a default under our existing or any future credit facility would result in a default under the indenture if the lenders accelerate the debt under our existing or any future debt agreements  even if the change of control itself would not cause a default thereunder 
moreover  we anticipate that the existing or any future debt agreement may restrict  and any other future indebtedness we incur may restrict our ability to repurchase indebtedness  including following a change of control event 
we may be unable to repay all of such indebtedness or obtain a waiver of that type 
any requirement to offer to repurchase outstanding notes may therefore require us to refinance our other outstanding debt  which may not be done on commercial reasonable terms  if at all 
we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares  so investors in our ordinary shares may not receive funds without selling their shares 
we do not intend to declare or pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future 
instead  we generally intend to invest any future earnings in our business 
subject to cayman islands law  our board of directors will determine the payment of future dividends on our ordinary shares  if any  and the amount of any dividends in light of any applicable contractual restrictions limiting our ability to pay dividends  our earnings and cash flows  our capital requirements  our financial condition and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
our debt agreements also restrict our ability to pay dividends or other distributions on our equity securities 
accordingly  shareholders may have to sell some or all of their ordinary shares in order to generate cash flow from their investment 
shareholders may not receive a gain on their investment when they sell our ordinary shares and may lose the entire amount of their investment 

table of contents our stock price has historically been volatile and the future market price for our ordinary shares could continue to be volatile 
the public market for our ordinary shares has historically been volatile 
any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be volatile 
since june   our ordinary shares have traded at prices as low as per share and as high as per share 
this price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares when you want and or at prices you find attractive 
we do not know of any one particular factor that has caused the volatility in our share price 
however  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
broad market factors and the investing public s negative perception of our business may reduce our share price  regardless of our operating performance 
a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in us 
because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands  you may face difficulties in protecting your interests  and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited 
we are an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands 
in addition  most of our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the united states upon our directors or executive officers  or enforce judgments obtained in the united states courts against our directors or executive officers 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association  the companies law revision as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time the companies law and the common law of the cayman islands 
the rights of holders of our securities to take action against the directors  actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are  to a large extent  governed by the common law of the cayman islands 
the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from english common law  the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority  but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands 
the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states 
in particular  the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws thus providing significantly less protection to investors as compared to the united states  and some states  such as delaware  which have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law 
the cayman islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the united states based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws  and to impose liabilities against us  in original actions brought in the cayman islands  based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws that are penal in nature 
additionally  cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states 
there is no statutory recognition in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  although the courts of the cayman islands will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce a non penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without re examination of the merits at common law  provided such judgment is final and conclusive  is one in respect of which the federal court of the united states had jurisdiction over the defendant according to cayman islands conflict of law rules  
table of contents is either for a liquidated sum not in respect of penalties or taxes or a fine or similar fiscal or revenue obligations or  in certain circumstances  for in personam non monetary relief  and was neither obtained in a manner  nor is of a kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the cayman islands 
the grand court of the cayman islands may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere 
one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue additional ordinary shares  which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
certain differences in corporate law in the cayman islands and the united states could discourage or prevent our acquisition 
cayman islands companies are governed by  among others laws  the companies laws 
the companies law is modeled on english law but does not follow recent english law statutory enactments  and differs from laws applicable to united states corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of some significant differences between the provisions of the companies law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the united states and their shareholders 
mergers and similar arrangements 
cayman island law does not provide for mergers as that expression is generally understood under the corporate laws of the various states of the united states 
while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances  commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a scheme of arrangement which may be tantamount to a merger  reconstructions and amalgamations can be achieved through other means to these statutory provisions  such as a share capital exchange  asset acquisition or control  through contractual arrangements  of an operating business 
in the event that these statutory provisions are used which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states  the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors  as the case may be  that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting  or meeting summoned for that purpose 
the convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands 
while a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not be approved  the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question  the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve  and the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law or that would amount to a fraud on the minority 
when a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of of the shares to which the offer applies within four months  the offeror may  within a two month period  require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer 
an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud  bad faith  collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders 
if the arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved  the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights  which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of united states corporations  providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares 

table of contents shareholders suits 
our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been successfully brought in a cayman islands court 
in principle  we will normally be the proper plaintiff and a claim against us for example or our officers or directors may not be brought by a shareholder 
however  based on english authorities  which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the cayman islands  exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which a company is acting or proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its authority  the act complained of  although not beyond the scope of the authority  could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained  or those who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority 
a shareholder may have a direct right of action against the company where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed 
holders of ordinary shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 
the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and provides significantly less protection to investors 
additionally  cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states 
although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  the courts of the cayman islands will recognize a foreign judgment as the basis for a claim at common law in the cayman islands provided such judgment is given by a competent foreign court  imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given  is final  is not in respect of taxes  a fine or a penalty  and was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands

table of contents in september  f capital asserted that we had breached agreements and understandings with f capital regarding the maximum number of ordinary shares we would sell in our public offering in august f capital indicated that it believed that it was damaged by the issuance of shares in excess of this amount 
we disagree with f capital s assertions 
we have worked to resolve these matters with f capital and believe that we have done so to each party s satisfaction  although no assurances can be given as to the ultimate resolution of this dispute 
on december   we received a letter from pritchard capital partners  llc pritchard capital claiming  pursuant to an engagement letter among us  ogil and pritchard capital that it had the right to participate in our december senior secured notes offering and to receive at least thirty percent of the fees the initial purchasers would receive 
we did not pay any fees to pritchard capital  and we do not believe that pritchard capital is entitled to any fees in connection with this offering
