gfn holdings and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as royal wolf 
background and overview we incorporated in delaware on october  and completed our initial public offering the ipo in april on september  september in australia  we acquired royal wolf by purchasing the outstanding shares of rwa 
the purchase price paid to the former shareholders of rwa was million  which consisted of million in cash  the issuance to bison capital australia  lp  bison capital  one of the sellers  of shares of common stock of gfn us and the issuance of a note to bison capital 
following the acquisition  we own of the outstanding capital stock of gfn us and bison capital owns of the outstanding capital stock of gfn us royal wolf leases and sells storage containers  portable container buildings and freight containers in australia and new zealand  which is considered geographically by the company to be the asia pacific area 
on october   we acquired pac van through a merger with mobile office acquisition corp 
moac  the parent of pac van  and our wholly owned subsidiary formed in july  gfnna 
in addition to assuming pac van s senior and other debt  we paid million to the stockholders of moac by a combination of million in cash   shares of gfn restricted common stock valued at million and a month subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million bearing interest at per annum 
pac van leases and sells modular buildings  mobile offices and storage containers in the united states 
the economic downturn in the united states  particularly in the construction related industries  and the global economy in general had an adverse impact on the company s operating results during the year ended june  we responded by reducing indebtedness  personnel costs  capital expenditures  discretionary spending and curtailing acquisition activity 
we continuously monitor our performance and customer demand levels by identifying and applying best practices to make our business more efficient 
accordingly  we may continue to reduce headcount or employee compensation in the areas in which we believe we can achieve greater efficiencies without affecting customer service or our sales efforts 
while this is our approach for the foreseeable future  our long term strategy and business plan is to acquire and operate rental services and specialty finance businesses in north america  europe and the asia pacific area 
our two operating subsidiaries  royal wolf and pac van  lease and sell storage container products  modular buildings and mobile offices through eighteen customer service centers cscs in australia  six cscs in new zealand and twenty six branch locations across eighteen states in the united states 
as of june   we had and employees and  and  lease fleet units in the asia pacific area and united states  respectively 
we do business in two distinct  but related industries  modular space and mobile storage  which we collectively refer to as the portable services industry 
prior to our acquisition of pac van  our revenue mix was approximately sales and leasing 
however  during the year ended june  the mix was sales and leasing 
our products include the following modular space modular buildings 
also known as manufactured buildings  modular buildings provide customers with additional space and are often modified to customer specifications 
modular buildings range in size from  to more than  square feet and may be highly customized 
mobile offices and portable container buildings 
also known as trailers or construction trailers  mobile offices are re locatable units with aluminum or wood exteriors on wood or steel frames on a steel carriage fitted with axles  allowing for an assortment of add ons to provide comfortable and convenient temporary space solutions 
we also offer portable container buildings  ground level offices glos  or office containers which are either modified or specifically manufactured shipping containers that are used as mobile offices  and in plant units  which are manufactured structures that provide self contained office space with maximum design flexibility 
ii 
table of contents mobile storage storage containers 
storage containers consist of new and used shipping containers that provide a flexible  low cost alternative to warehousing  while offering greater security  convenience  and immediate accessibility 
our storage products include general purpose dry storage containers  refrigerated containers and specialty containers in a range of standard and modified sizes  designs and storage capacities 
specialty containers include blast resistant units  hoarding units and hazardous waste units 
we also offer storage vans  also known as storage trailers or dock height trailers 
freight containers 
freight containers are specifically designed for transport of products by road and rail 
our freight container products include curtain side  refrigerated and bulk cargo containers  together with a range of standard and industry specific dry freight containers 
results of operations year ended june  fy compared to year ended june  fy the following compares our fy results of operations with our fy results of operations 
revenues 
revenues increased to million in fy versus in fy this included an increase of a million in revenues at pac van  which we acquired on october   and a million increase in revenues in fy from fy at royal wolf 
the translation effect of the average currency exchange rate  driven by the strengthening in the australian dollar to the us dollar in fy versus fy  caused the increase in total revenues at royal wolf  which otherwise would have shown a reduction of approximately in total revenues 
the economic downturn in both our geographic segments during fy resulted in a significant reduction in our overall business  but particularly in the construction related sector in the united states and in the mining and defense and transportation sectors in the asia pacific area 
these sectors had an aggregate decline in revenues of approximately million and million from fy  respectively 
sales and leasing revenues represented and of total revenues in fy and and of total revenues in fy  respectively  the more favorable leasing revenue mix in fy resulting primarily from our acquisition of pac van 
sales during fy amounted to million  compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily because sales at royal wolf were million higher in fy from fy due to the strengthening of the australian dollar between periods and by a net sales increase in fy from fy of million as a result of the acquisition of pac van 
without the benefit of the translation effect as a result of the stronger australian dollar in fy from fy  royal wolf s sales revenues would have decreased by 
in fy  sales in the asia pacific area declined million in our national accounts group or non retail operations  primarily because of the reduced activity in the mining and defense and transportation sectors  and increased million in our csc retail operations from fy the million decrease in our national accounts group consisted of a million reduction due to lower prices  which was offset somewhat by a million increase due to higher unit sales and a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of million 
the decrease in our sales prices was primarily due to sales of certain mining container units that remain in inventory as a result of a cancelled leasing order in fy there are of these units available for sale at june   at a cost of approximately  each  which we anticipate selling in the range of  per unit 
the million increase in our retail operations consisted of a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of million and a million increase from higher unit sales  offset somewhat by a million reduction due to lower prices  reflecting our efforts to reduce fleet inventories in the current economic environment 
the higher unit sales were primarily due to increased demand in our cscs in western australia and the northern territory because of increased oil exploration activities in those regions 
leasing revenues during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to net leasing revenue increases in fy from fy of million as result of the acquisition of pac van and million at royal wolf  which was the result of a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of million million and million in our retail business and national accounts group  respectively and a million increase in lease rates million and million in our retail business and national accounts group  respectively  offset somewhat by a decrease of million in the average total number of units on lease per month million and million in our retail business and national accounts group  respectively 
without the benefit of the translation effect as a result of the stronger australian dollar in fy from fy  royal wolf s leasing revenues would have decreased by 
ii 
table of contents at royal wolf  average utilization in the retail operations was during fy  as compared to during fy  and average utilization in the national accounts group operations was during fy  as compared to during fy overall average utilization at royal wolf was in fy and in fy the average monthly lease rate of containers in fy for royal wolf was aus  as compared to aus in fy though leasing revenues at royal wolf decreased between the periods primarily because the unit size of our lease fleet has decreased by since june  as a result of our efforts to curtail expenditures  our overall average utilization remained steady and our monthly lease rate increased 
we believe this is reflective of our position as the only national company in the mobile storage industry in australia and new zealand 
royal wolf continually reviews each local market in which it does business to determine if local factors justify increases or decreases in lease rates and the effect these changes would have on utilization and revenues 
at pac van  average utilization rates were  and and monthly lease rates were  and for containers  mobile offices and modular units  respectively  during fy  as compared to  and and  and  for containers  mobile offices and modular units  respectively 
the lower monthly lease rates resulted from lower demand and increased competition  particularly in the construction related industry in which pac van has approximately of its business 
maintaining utilization rates was of particular importance as under its senior secured credit facility led by boa  pac van was required to maintain a minimum composite utilization rate  as defined  of over at each quarterend 
at june   the composite utilization rate was 
the average value of the australian dollar against the us dollar strengthened during fy as compared to fy the average currency exchange rate of one australian dollar during fy was us dollar compared to us dollar during fy this fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase to our total revenues at royal wolf of million in fy when compared to fy cost of sales 
cost of sales which is the cost related to our sales revenues only and exclusive of the line items discussed below increased by a net million to million during fy from million during fy  which was not proportionate with the increase in sales of million 
our gross profit percentage from sales revenues was during fy  which deteriorated slightly from in fy  but did receive the benefit of a favorable foreign currency exchange rate effect on the greater proportion of sales in the asia pacific area 
otherwise there would have been a greater deterioration in fy because of the downward pressures on our margins in the current economic environment 
direct costs of leasing operations and selling and general expenses 
direct costs of leasing operations which excludes depreciation and amortization and selling and general expenses increased by million during fy to million from million during fy this increase included million incurred at pac van during the quarter ended september   to which there was no comparable cost in the quarter ended september  of the prior year since pac van was not acquired until october  as a percentage of revenues  these operating expenses increased to in fy from in fy  reflecting the foreign exchange effect of the stronger australian dollar against the us dollar 
on an absolute basis  excluding the million incurred at pac van during the quarter ended september   the net decrease of million was primarily due to our cost cutting measures implemented during the second half of fy this cost cutting involved salaries and related payroll costs as a result of staff reductions and lower bonuses  less discretionary spending and better control of our professional costs 
in general  pac van s operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher than royal wolf s percentage as royal wolf s mix of fy sales to leasing revenue at is higher than the at pac van  pac van has invested in an office modular fleet which is a lower margin product line  and pac van has less density in its retail markets 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of fy we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million to the goodwill recorded in the pac van acquisition 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during fy from million during fy the increase was primarily due to adjustments to fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets as a result of the pac van acquisition  the effect of net capital expenditures since june  and the translation effect of the stronger australian dollar in fy versus fy depreciation and amortization at pac van during the quarter ended september  totaled million 
in addition  depreciation and amortization includes impairment charges to certain intangible assets recorded in the pac van acquisition of million in fy and million in fy reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding intangible assets 
ii 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense of million in fy was million lower than the million in fy this was due primarily to an overall million interest reduction including foreign translation effect at royal wolf  caused by a lower effective interest rate and an unrealized gain on interest rate swap and option contracts totaling million in fy versus an unrealized loss of million in fy royal wolf s weighted average interest rate without the effect of the interest rate swap and option contracts was in fy  as compared to in fy two small acquisitions in fy and capital expenditure requirements for fy and fy in the asia pacific area were funded primarily by borrowings under the senior credit facility with australia and new zealand banking group limited anz 
the pac van acquisition  another small acquisition in fy and capital requirements for fy and fy in the us were funded principally with the assumption of and borrowings under the boa senior credit facility and the senior subordinated secured note payable to spv capital funding  llc spv 
interest expense at pac van  with a weighted average rate of  totaled million in fy of which million was incurred in the quarter ended september   as compared to in fy  including the quarter prior to our acquisition of pac van 
foreign currency exchange 
we have certain us dollar denominated debt at royal wolf  including intercompany borrowings  which are remeasured at each financial reporting date with the impact of the remeasurement being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from such remeasurement due to changes in the australian exchange rate to the us dollar could have a significant impact in our reported results of operations  as well as any realized gains and losses from the payments on such us dollar denominated debt and intercompany borrowings 
as noted above  the average value of the us dollar against the australian dollar weakened during fy as compared to fy and from june  to june  the currency exchange rate of one australian dollar at june  was us dollar compared to us dollar at june  in fy  net unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains totaled million and million  respectively  and net unrealized gains on forward currency exchange contracts totaled million 
in fy  net unrealized foreign exchange losses totaled million and realized exchange losses totaled million  primarily because of a realized exchange loss of million as a result of royal wolf s repayment of intercompany advances totaling million in september we advanced million of the proceeds received from our warrant exercise program in may to royal wolf for the temporary reduction of long term borrowings prior to the ultimate use of these proceeds in the acquisition of pac van on october  net unrealized gains on forward currency exchange contracts totaled million in fy income taxes 
our effective income tax benefit rate decreased to during fy from the fy effective rate of rate  primarily because of the non deductibility charge for us federal income tax purposes of the goodwill impairment charge and a portion of the depreciation and amortization on the fixed and intangible assets recorded in the pac van acquisition  offset somewhat by the favorable income tax impact of the amortization of goodwill acquired in acquisitions made in the asia pacific area  which is deductible for us income tax reporting purposes 
we are now required to file tax returns in multiple us states as a result of the pac van acquisition 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding income taxes 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest  which represents bison capital s interest in royal wolf  was a charge of million in fy  as compared to a benefit of million in fy as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we commenced accreting the redemption value of the bison capital put option over the period from july  through june   which resulted in a charge to noncontrolling interest in fy in fy  the benefit was due to the substantial net loss incurred at royal wolf in fy  primarily as a result of the unrealized losses on foreign exchange and interest rate swap an option contracts discussed above 
net income attributable to common stockholders 
we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million during fy  as compared to a net loss of million during fy  primarily as a result of the impairment of goodwill and the accretion of the bison put option  offset somewhat by the operating profit from pac van in the quarter ended september   the favorable impact of the foreign exchange and forward currency exchange contract gains and reduced interest expense in fy versus fy measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap earnings before interest  income taxes  impairment  depreciation and amortization and other non operating costs and income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with us gaap 
these measures are not measurements of our financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  income from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ii 
table of contents adjusted ebitda is a non us gaap measure 
we calculate adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations 
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider each to be appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
we present adjusted ebitda because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  many of which present ebitda and a form of our adjusted ebitda when reporting their results 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
the following table shows our adjusted ebitda and the reconciliation from net income loss in thousands year ended june  net loss add provision benefit for income taxes foreign currency exchange gain loss and other interest expense interest income depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill share based compensation expense adjusted ebitda our business is capital intensive  so from an operating level we focus primarily on ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
these measures provide us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and fleet growth objectives 
in managing our business  we regularly compare our adjusted ebitda margins on a monthly basis 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch or csc  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when  the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produces large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
liquidity and financial condition each of our two operating units  royal wolf and pac van  fund their operations substantially through secured bank credit facilities that require compliance with various covenants 
these covenants require them to  among other things  maintain certain levels of interest coverage  ebitda as defined  unit utilization rate and overall leverage 
in addition  we have certain obligations and subordinated notes payable to bison capital with our purchase of royal wolf and  subsequent to june   a subordinated note payable by gfn to laminar direct capital  llc laminar 
we also have a million credit facility with union bank at gfn under which no borrowings were outstanding as of june  the economic downturn in the us  particularly in the construction related industries  and the global economy in general had an adverse impact on our operating results during fy to offset this adverse effect  we continued to undertake cost reduction and other measures to be able to reduce our indebtedness and continue complying with the financial loan covenants of our senior lenders 
during the fourth quarter of fy  we amended our senior credit agreements at royal wolf to  among other things  extend required principal payments during the fiscal year ending june  and establish financial covenants at the anz credit facility at more favorable levels 
in addition  on june  we completed a rights offering for the issuance and sale of units at each with each unit consisting of one share of gfn common stock and a three year warrant to purchase additional shares of gfn common stock at an exercise price of per share that resulted in net proceeds of  ii 
table of contents on july   we entered into several agreements relating to a a new  senior secured revolving credit facility at pac van with a syndicate led by pnc bank  national association pnc and including wells fargo bank  national association and union bank the pnc credit facility  and b a new  senior subordinated note with laminar issued by gfn the laminar note 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility and proceeds from both the issuance of the laminar note and our rights offering completed on june  were used to prepay in full all borrowings under the boa credit facility and the  senior subordinated secured note payable to spv 
this refinancing also resulted in the establishment of less restrictive covenants through the pnc credit facility 
the pnc credit facility matures on january  and the laminar note matures on july  reference is made to notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our rights offering and indebtedness 
these actions should allow us to be able to satisfy its long term debt and other liquidity requirements and to comply with our financial loan covenants for the foreseeable future 
however  if operating results do not improve  or worsen  we may eventually be unable to comply with the covenants governing our indebtedness  which may require waivers of covenant compliance  amendments to such agreements or alternative borrowing arrangements 
in the event of noncompliance with covenants  there is no assurance that the senior lenders would consent to such an amendment or waiver in the event of noncompliance  or that such consent would not be conditioned upon the receipt of a cash payment  revised principal payout terms  increased interest rates  or restrictions in the expansion of the credit facilities 
nor is there any assurance that senior lenders would not exercise rights that would be available to them  including  among other things  demanding payment of outstanding borrowings 
as of june   our required principal and other obligations payments including bison capital s put option for the year ending june  and the subsequent three years are as follows in thousands year ending june  anz senior credit facility a bison capital subordinated notes bison capital put option boa senior credit facility b spv subordinated note c other a reflects the invoice financing and overdraft facilities totaling million as a current maturity 
these should continually roll over and would be fully repaid at the maturity of the anz facility 
b scheduled to mature in august  this facility was repaid in full in july as a result of the pac van refinancing and replaced by the pnc credit facility that matures in january c scheduled to mature in february  this note was repaid in full in july as a result of the pac van refinancing and replaced in part by the laminar note that matures in july as reflected above  unless conditions significantly change  a company wide capital restructuring will be required some time before or during the fiscal year ending june   as the majority of the outstanding indebtedness mature during this period 
in the foreseeable future  however  we have three principal objectives with respect to our liquidity reduce overall leverage in each operating entity by minimizing capital expenditures and using operating cash flow to pay interest and reduce debt 
operate the businesses to meet all loan covenant requirements 
generate sufficient capital  either through operations or external sources  including debt or equity  to meet loan maturities and the potential payment of the bison capital put option 
as a part of achieving these objectives  and depending on our operating performance  we may require external financing in the foreseeable future to pay the million due bison capital in july and the bison capital put option exercisable in september this put option could be paid  with bison capital s approval  by a combination of cash and common stock 
while we believe such external financing could be derived from various sources  including private individual or institutional investors  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required capital under favorable terms and conditions  if at all 
we currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock and do not intend on doing so in the foreseeable future 
ii 
table of contents cash flow for fy compared to fy our leasing business is capital intensive  and we acquire leasing assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
these leasing assets have very long useful lives and require relatively minimal maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our retail locations and to add to our breadth of product mix 
our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our reported earnings  which would include  even in profitable periods  the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
as we discussed above  during fy our principal sources of capital consisted of funds available from the senior secured credit facilities at each of our operating units 
we also have a million line of credit with union bank and have outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in addition  during fy  we completed a rights offering that resulted in net proceeds of million 
supplemental information pertaining to our combined sources and uses of cash is presented in the table below in thousands year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million during fy  as compared to million during fy the increase in operating cash flows of million in fy from fy was primarily due to non cash adjustments for i the impairment of goodwill of million in fy  ii depreciation and amortization of million in fy versus million in fy and iii the additional benefit in deferred income taxes of million in fy versus fy cash provided by operating activities is typically enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at june  we had a net deferred tax liability of million 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding income taxes 
these increases were substantially offset by a greater net loss of million in fy versus million in fy  non cash adjustments for i unrealized foreign exchange gains of million in fy versus an unrealized loss of million in fy  ii unrealized gains on interest rate swaps and options of million in fy versus an unrealized loss of million in fy  and iii unrealized gains on forward exchange contracts of million in fy versus million in fy  and management of cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of million in fy versus million in fy investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fy  as compared to million for fy in fy  we used million to acquire pac van and to complete three other small acquisitions 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  or rolling stock  were reduced to approximately million in fy from million in fy  and purchases of lease fleet declined significantly from million in fy to million in fy  despite the acquisition of pac van in the first quarter of fy and its capital requirements 
in the current economic environment  we are minimizing capital expenditures to reduce our overall leverage and anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on acquiring a specific types of units that are not in our fleet and are placed on rent  b technology and communication improvements for our telephone and computer systems and c delivery equipment whereby we would derive improved customer service levels and cost savings 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
other than a preferred supply agreement  which requires us to purchase up to  containers if offered to us  and the put and call options pertaining to bison capital s minority interest of in gfn us  we have no significant long term contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we may be required to purchase at a certain price or a minimum amount of goods or services 
reference is made to note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities was million for fy  as compared to million provided in fy during the second half of fy  we made debt reduction a principal objective 
in fy  we reduced our outstanding borrowings by million  as compared to borrowing million in fy in fy  we completed a rights offering that resulted in net proceeds of million  million of which was used in the pac van refinancing subsequent to june  reference is made to note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the pac van refinancing 
proceeds from our capital issuances and net borrowings were used together with cash flow generated from operations to primarily fund the acquisition of pac van  as well as three smaller acquisitions and the expansion of our lease fleet  during fy ii 
table of contents asset management receivables and inventories decreased including foreign translation effect from million and million at june  to million and million at june   respectively 
effective asset management is always a significant focus for us  particularly in this current economic environment  as we strive to continue to apply appropriate credit and collection controls and reduce inventory levels to maintain and enhance cash flow and profitability 
at june   days sales outstanding dso in trade receivables were days and days for royal wolf and pac van  as compared to days and days at june   respectively 
the net book value of our total lease fleet decreased including foreign translation effect from million at june  to million at june  at june   we had  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states in our lease fleet  as compared  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states at june  at those dates   units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states and  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states were on lease  respectively 
in the united states  at june  and june   the lease fleet was comprised of  containers   mobile offices and modular units at june   and  containers   mobile offices and  modular units at june  at those dates  in the united states  units on lease were comprised of  containers   mobile offices and modular units  and  containers   mobile offices and modular units  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
seasonality although demand from certain customer segments can be seasonal  our operations as a whole are not seasonal to any significant extent 
we experience a reduction in sales volumes at royal wolf during australia s summer holiday break from mid december to the end of january  followed by february being a short working day month 
however  this reduction in sales typically is counterbalanced by the increased lease revenues derived from the removals or moving and storage industry  which experiences its seasonal peak of personnel relocations during this same summer holiday break 
demand from some of pac van s customers can be seasonal  such as in the construction industry  which tends to increase leasing activity in the first and fourth quarters  while customers in the retail industry tend to lease more units in the second quarter 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
however  during periods of rising prices and  in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
ii 
table of contents we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
accordingly  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
on a recurring basis  we evaluate a variety of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers  days outstanding trends  a review of historical collection results and a review of specific past due receivables 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net income 
to date  uncollectible accounts have been within the range of our expectations 
we lease and sell storage container products  modular buildings and mobile offices to our customers 
leases to customers generally qualify as operating leases unless there is a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a fleet of storage containers  mobile offices  modular buildings and steps that we lease to customers under operating lease agreements with varying terms 
the lease fleet or lease or rental equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life years  after the date the units are put in service  and are depreciated down to their estimated residual values up to of cost 
in our opinion  estimated residual values are at or below net realizable values 
we periodically review these depreciation policies against various factors  including the practices of the larger competitors in the industry  and our own historical experience 
for the issuances of stock options  we follow the fair value provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
fasb asc topic requires recognition of employee share based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of the purchase option is the black scholes pricing model 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  market prices and volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
in particular  prior to july   we used volatility rates based upon a sample of comparable companies our industry and we now use a volatility rate based on the performance of our common stock  which yields a higher rate 
in addition we use a risk free interest rate  which is the rate on us treasury instruments  for a security with a maturity that approximates the estimated remaining expected term of the stock option 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
fasb asc topic prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we operate two reportable and operating segments pac van and royal wolf 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these two reporting units 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at june using the two step process required under fasb asc topic the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we would also consider performing impairment tests during an interim reporting period in which significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that a permanent impairment may have occurred 
some factors we consider important which could trigger such an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant changes during the period in our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
at june   we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined on a weighted average range of multiples to adjusted ebitda 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit was based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach was dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures and discount rates 
each approach was given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the net assets of any reporting unit would have exceeded its fair value  a step two impairment test would have been performed 
in a step two test  we would be required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
generally  this would involve allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the respective assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in separate and individual business combination and the fair value was the price paid to acquire it with the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities being the implied fair value of goodwill 
it was determined that the fair value of the royal wolf reporting unit exceeded the carrying values of the net assets at june  however  the fair value of the pac van reporting unit was less than the carrying values the net assets at june  and  therefore  we performed a step two impairment test for pac van 
in the step two test for pac van  the implied value of its goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of fy the company had not recorded an impairment charge to goodwill prior to fy ii 
table of contents intangible assets include those with indefinite trademark and trade name  and finite primarily customer base and lists  non compete agreements and deferred financing costs useful lives 
customer base and lists and non compete agreements are amortized on the straight line basis over the expected period of benefit which range from one to ten years 
costs to obtaining long term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the straight line method 
amortizing the deferred financing costs using the straight line method does not produce significantly different results than that of the effective interest method 
we review intangibles those assets resulting from acquisitions at least annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
we determined that  as a result of changes in market conditions and other factors in the us  an impairment charge to the customer base acquired in the pac van acquisition was required to be recorded at both june  and june   and  as of june   to the trade name 
to be more in line with the expected revenue stream of the customer base  we recorded the fy impairment charge of  by revising the method of amortization from a straight line to an accelerated basis 
the fy impairment charge to the customer base and trade name of  and  respectively  was recorded pursuant to an evaluation  which determined that the respective fair values were less than the carrying values 
these impairment charges were included as a part of depreciation and amortization 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance would be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we would increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance would be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination
