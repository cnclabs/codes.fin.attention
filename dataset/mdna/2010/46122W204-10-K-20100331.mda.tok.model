item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an internet marketing business separated into two reporting units exchange  and direct 
the exchange segment is focused on the technology  analytics and data necessary to facilitate business to business bb advertising transactions 
the exchange segment provides performance based marketing and technology solutions to advertisers and publishers 
these solutions help advertisers acquire customers with payment for services to inuvo occurring either on a pay per click or pay per action basis 
the exchange has tens of thousands of advertisers and thousands of publisher partners 
our direct segment utilizes online techniques to acquire information about consumers that can  but has not always been  subsequently monetized over time 
we collect the consumer data  which includes name  address  phone number and email address to enable us to expand and develop the database and market various internal and external products to the consumers 
we determine the interest in a variety of product offers through a combination of inbound outbound calls by a telemarketing representative  email marketing initiatives and postal offers 
beginning in the first quarter of  we also now include our lead generation business  which was formerly included in our exchange segment  as part of our direct segment 
lead generation specializes in matching high c onverting  high paying offers from advertisers to high quality traffic and leads through a network of select affiliates using our proprietary exchange platforms 
we believe that the cornerstone of our value proposition for advertisers is our ability to generate high converting leads at an attractive roi 
concurrently  to allow for scale within our advertising exchange  we must also attract high traffic web publishers where competition for advertising space is driven primarily by the amount paid for each click  often irrespective of actual return for advertisers 
we believe that this general lack of transparency and segmentation between advertisers and publishers within online networks who serve this marketing channel will evolve in much the same manner as other channels have over the last years 
as all parties better understand the methods and procedures for roi  technologies that reward the best behaviors and penalize the worst become the differ entiating component between service providers 
we believe we have been on the forefront of these technologies for the past five years 
from our click fraud technology that has successfully proven its ability to eliminate bad traffic to our exclusive fico click conversion scoring technology that highlights the best performing cost per click publishers  we have and will continue to operate our business based on the principle of quality 
in what was our most significant product redesign in our history  during we brought to market our inuvo platform which was launched in beta in october within this solution  advertisers are able to create and manage advertising campaigns  web publishers are better able to monetize their inventory and strategic partners and web developers are allowed to customize the framework through application programming interfaces 
for example  our customers are able to build applications on top of our platform 
we therefore see our company well positioned to capitalize on market trends that play to our technological strengths 
a very important by product of our advertising exchange is the information produced both on the advertiser side where we see what kind of products convert and on the publisher side where we see what kind of web sites attract viewers 
this business intelligence when combined with the operating leverage we have because we own the exchange makes running our own direct marketing programs online an attractive adjacent business model 
the advantage we have in this business is not limited by industry or product type 
for example  if we see an opportunity  based on our business intelligence  that suggests an upward trend in consumer interest associated with consumer health  we line up a product supplier  launch a web site  drive traffic and capitalize on the opportunity 
from nutritional supplement s  to continuing education  to home based businesses  we believe that these online marketing programs sites fulfill a need in the market  utilize our existing infrastructure and produce attractive margins 
additionally  we may develop or acquire specific niche web properties that will be differentiated from our existing business partners that may provide a value added alternative for our exchange 
in we intend to continue the transformation that began in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout in march of we determined that as a result of recent market pressures from credit card processors to accelerate our decision to exit the negative option marketing programs which became part of our direct segment following the ilead media  inc acquisition in we are currently exploring a number of transitional opportunities related to these online consumer programs  which collectively have represented as much as of our historical net revenue from continuing operations 
during we will continue our efforts to balance our desire to capture greater market share through investments in technology  sales and marketing with the limitations we have both organizationally and in the current structure of our existing credit facility 
we believe that there are opportunities to grow and enhance our direct segment from the by product of data collected in our exchange segment that teaches us about consumer behavior 
additionally  the natural demands of the business for data and infrastructure provide a great opportunity to understand the needs of advertisers and affiliates to enhance our exchange platform to modify our service offering to satisfy the needs of the market 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting practices gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and amortizable intangibles and income taxes  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and l iabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition general asc 
under asc  we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the following principles with respect to our different business services exchange segment affiliate network consistent with the provisions asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations asc we recognize revenue as an agent in affiliate marketing transactions in which we are not the primary obligor 
accordingly  service fee revenue is recognized on a net basis because any affiliate expenses are the responsibility of our advertising customer 
in certain instances we assume the position of primary obligor and thus recognize revenue on a gross basis 
revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 
search network in accordance with asc we record as revenue the gross amount received from advertisers and the amount paid to the publishers placing the advertisements as cost of revenue 
revenue from our company owned networks is based on a per click basis and is recognized once the action is taken 
affiliate software we recognize revenue the month in which the software is utilized 
customers are invoiced on the first of the month for the monthly services 
all overages for the month are billed at the end of the month and are included in our accounts receivable 
hosting arrangements we recognize revenue through a monthly hosting fee and additional usage fees as provided 
direct segment online membership income we recognize revenue from online membership revenue when payment is received and the service date of providing membership benefits has taken place 
lead sales for lead sales  our revenue recognition varies depending on the arrangement with the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for delivery only  revenue is recognized when the lead information is provided to the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for compensation based on sales generated by the purchaser from the lead  we recognize revenue in the period that the purchasing company makes a sale that was derived from the lead 
product sales for product sales  we recognize revenue when payment is received and the goods are shipped 
list management services substantially all of our revenue is recorded at the net amount of its gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a customer 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to customers exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses 
in compliance with asc  we assess whether we or a third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we have evaluated the terms of our customer agreements and considered other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection an d credit risk to the vendor as part of this assessment 
accordingly  we generally record revenue net of pass through charges 
subscription income we recognize revenue on monthly and multi monthly subscription contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
accounts receivable we record our accounts receivable based upon the invoiced amount and they are considered past due when full payment is not received by the specified credit terms 
we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon those estimates 
the allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of ou r reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets  which result from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
trade names are not amortized as they are believed to have an indefinite life 
trade names are reviewed annually for impairment under asc for the years ended december  and we had impairments on our goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
deferred taxes we reserve for federal and state income taxes on items included in our consolidated statements of operations regardless of the period when the taxes are payable 
deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in evaluating our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be r ealized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we must project future levels of taxable income 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we examine the evidence related to a recent history of tax losses  the economic conditions in which we operate  recent organizational changes  our near term projections  as well as the recent changes in our financing agreement with wachovia bank  na as a result  we were unable to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that any of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we therefore have recorded a full impairment for the net deferred tax asset 
stock awards we value stock compensation based on the fair value recognition provisions asc  compensation stock compensation  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of option grants over the requisite employee service period

as a result  in we discontinued the operations of a number of these companies 
despite these challenges  we began a significant transformation in which continued into that included the elimination of approximately positions  the sale of businesses with little synergy and the reorganization of our operations along two business segments 
notwithstanding these accomplishments  the downturn of the economy has impacted the advertising spend in our exchange segment and consumer spending in our direct segment  both of which adversely impacted our results of operations during overall  net revenues declined approximately for from and a greater percentage of our net revenues were derived from our exchange segment in which reflects the impact of consumer spending and the loss of revenue from ringtones 
gross profit declined by approximately in when compared to which reflects the overall decline in revenues plus a shift from direct to exchange  which is a lower margin segment 
in  our total operating expenses decreased by approximately million in absolute dollars which reflects a reduction in head co unt  professional fees and depreciation and amortization expenses  partially offset by an increase in search spend

the decline in net revenues from the babytobee business was the result of changes in email delivery and isps 
net revenue for the direct segment will be negatively impacted by the exiting of the home business offers which was a direct result of regulatory pressure 
we believe our exchange segment will experience a modest growth in net revenue resulting from the continued efforts to expand the inuvo platform and the market acceleration in the search spending 
cost of revenue and gross profit to better present our results of operations in a way that allows for better transparency and understanding  in we have expanded the operating expense category of our consolidated results of operations to include the components of cost of revenue and other operating expenses

some of these acquisition costs are being expensed as incurred in accordance with gaap even though these costs apply to the building of a names database that will be monetized in the future  others associated with the babytobee brand are capitalized and amortized over to months

in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
due to continued declines in our market capitalization and deterioration in the overall markets in which we operate  in we tested our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment several times during during the process we determined that all of our reporting units were impaired and we recorded impairment charges during as we deemed appropriate 
in march  we were informed by our merchant processors that they would no longer process our home business offers credit card transactions

income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax expense as described earlier in this report  previously our business was conducted in three operating segments which also included our advertising segment 
in the second quarter of our board of directors decided to pursue the divestiture of the assets of our advertising agency  which was in the advertising segment  as well as the dating business and the consumer marketing business  which were both part of the direct segment 
at the time  the decision was driven primarily as a means to focus on the higher growth exchange segment 
upon further review  during february  our board of directors decided to retain the consumer marketing business  rationalizing that this business could in fact retain a competitive advantage in the market by utilizing the resources and services of the exchange segment
