the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions  may also adversely affect our business and operations 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with md a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and make it more difficult for us to service our debt or obtain additional financing  if necessary 
we incurred a substantial level of debt in connection with our acquisition of advo in this high degree of leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations  we face increased risks regarding  among other things  the following our ability to borrow additional amounts or refinance existing indebtedness in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  investments  stock repurchases  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes may be limited or such financing may be more costly  we have reduced availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and other general corporate purposes because a substantial portion of our cash flow is needed to pay principal and interest on our debt  we are more vulnerable to competitive pressures and to general adverse economic or industry conditions  including fluctuations in market interest rates or a downturn in our business  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have greater financial resources than us  including news america and its parent corporation  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing  as needed 
in addition  the indentures governing our senior notes due  or the notes  and our senior secured convertible notes due  or the secured notes  and our senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay such debt  if accelerated  or that we would be able to repay  refinance or restructure the payments on such debt 
see the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes and any of the agreements governing our future indebtedness could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 

table of contents despite our current indebtedness levels and the restrictive covenants set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness 
this could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 
the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes permit us and certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness  including additional secured indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in these agreements  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness 
in addition  under certain circumstances we will have the right to increase the size of our senior secured credit facility 
if new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
we may not be able to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow to meet our debt obligations 
our ability to make scheduled payments with respect to our indebtedness depends on our future financial and operating performance and ability to refinance debt when necessary 
each of these factors largely depends on prevailing economic conditions and certain financial  business  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt  we will be in default and  as a result  holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest on our debt to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
furthermore  if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional capital  restructure our debt or revise or delay our strategic plans 
we cannot assure you that our operating performance  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of our debt in the future 
if we are required to take any of the actions referred to above  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us  or at all  that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments 
in addition  any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes and any of the agreements governing our future indebtedness could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our notes and our secured notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to take certain actions 
our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes also restrict  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments  loans and advances  create or permit certain liens  issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  use the proceeds from sales of assets and subsidiary stock  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  create or permit restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies 

table of contents these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may prohibit or limit our ability to enhance our operations  take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or meet our capital needs 
furthermore  future debt instruments or other contracts could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to our senior secured credit facility  the secured notes or the notes 
the breach of any of these covenants by us or the failure by us to meet any of these conditions or requirements could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants and requirements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
an event of default under our debt agreements could trigger events of default under our other debt agreements and the holders of the defaulted debt could declare all of the amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to become immediately due and payable 
if such acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
disruptions in the credit markets have made it more difficult for companies to secure financing 
if we are unable to access financing on terms and at a time acceptable to us for any reason  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support the ongoing activities of our business  repay our existing debt obligations and to make limited investments in future growth opportunities 
our ability to obtain any financing or refinancing  whether through the issuance of new equity or debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
over the past two years  credit markets have experienced unusual uncertainty  and liquidity and access to capital markets and other sources of financing have tightened 
consequently  in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
some of our debt  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  is based on variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   million of our billion aggregate indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
two interest rate swap agreements fix the interest rate for an aggregate of million of this variable rate debt under our senior secured credit facility at an interest rate of and expire in december our remaining variable rate debt of million is subject to market rate risk  as our interest payments will fluctuate as the underlying interest rates change as a result of market changes 
during the period when our interest rate swap agreements are effective  a change in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million per year 
if there is a rise in interest rates  our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would affect our cash flows and results of operations 
if we borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility  our market rate risk may increase 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an initial notional amount of million to fix the interest rate at 
the notional amount of million amortizes by million at the end of each quarter to million for the quarter ended june  the effective date of this new swap agreement corresponds to the expiration date of the existing swap agreements 
the economic downturn during the past two years and uncertain future outlook  including the credit and liquidity crisis in the financial markets  could continue to further negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our business results could be adversely affected by a prolonged global  national or regional economic recession 
as a result of the credit and liquidity crisis in the us and throughout the global financial system  substantial volatility in world capital markets and the banking industry has occurred 
the economic volatility and the tightening of credit markets during the past two years has resulted in widespread reduction in business activity and consumer spending 
from an operational perspective  we have been experiencing lower revenues as a result of reduced consumer confidence and reduced advertising spending in our markets 
from a financing perspective  this unprecedented instability and the tightening of the credit markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain credit which may restrict their ability to purchase our products and services 
additionally  it may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  on satisfactory terms or at all 
the difficult economic conditions may not improve significantly in the near future and any continuation or worsening of these conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
our products that reach a large area at low cost compete in the cooperative fsi business principally with news america 
we compete for business primarily on the basis of price  category availability  targeting ability and customer service and relationships 
news america has been competing aggressively for fsi business 
as a consequence  fsi prices have declined substantially over the last several years and are expected to continue to decline in the foreseeable future 
we cannot predict when  or if  fsi prices will stabilize or increase 
this has resulted generally in decreasing revenues and profitability for our fsi segment 
when fsi contracts come up for renewal  we may not be able to renew them on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our primary competitor  news america  and its parent corporation  have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
this competitor could take a greater market share and cause us to lose business from our clients 
in addition  it is possible that alternative media or changes in promotional strategies could make our products less attractive to our clients and could cause a loss of demand for our products and services 
our shared mail segment is our largest revenue producer and most profitable segment 
our shared mail segment s media business faces intense competition based primarily on the ability to target selected potential customers on a cost effective basis and provide a satisfactory return on advertising investment 
shared mail products also compete for advertising dollars against other forms of print and electronic media and other advertising in general 
competition for market share advertising also comes from magazines  radio  broadcast and cable television  shoppers  the internet  other communications media and other advertising printers that operate in shared mail markets 
the extent and nature of such competition are  in large part  determined by the location and demographics of the markets targeted by a particular advertiser and the number of media alternatives in those markets 
shared mail clients and prospective clients are operating with lower advertising budgets  while trying to allocate their spending across a growing number of media channels 
they are increasingly faced with the challenge of doing more with less 
the failure to develop new products and services could result in the loss of clients to current or future competitors 
in addition  failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect growth 
our neighborhood targeted segment competes against commercial printers and media placement agencies for solo specialized promotional programs for single advertisers 
while both types of competitors have a history of competing on the basis of price to increase volume and improve economies of scale  commercial printers tend to be particularly aggressive during periods when they have unused capacity 
in addition  we compete with sunflower marketing with respect to our polybag advertising and sampling products 
to the extent our competitors in these businesses decide to compete more aggressively on price due to excess capacity or for other reasons it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our neighborhood targeted products also compete with several newspaper network groups in the rop market 
while entering the rop market does not require a significant investment in machinery and equipment  it does require a significant investment in systems and human resources in order to compete effectively 
an increase in the number of rop competitors could result in a loss of market share 
in our international  digital media services segment  our subsidiary  nch marketing services  inc  competes against carolina manufacturing services and carolina services  both owned by inmar  inc  and international outsourcing services  llc for coupon clearing and redemption services in the us to the extent that our competitors in this business decide to compete more aggressively on price  it could lower our market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our shared mail segment depends on the usps and other third parties for delivery of its products 
if such third parties do not fulfill their obligations  our shared mail segment may lose clients and experience reduced revenues and profitability 
our shared mail segment s products are primarily delivered through the usps 
postage expense is our shared mail segment s largest expense 
the inability of the usps to deliver our shared mail segment s products on a timely basis or any reduction in the number of days the usps delivers mail could disrupt our shared mail segment s business and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  usps rates increase periodically  and we have no control over increases that may occur in the future 
an increase in the cost of postage combined with our shared mail segment s inability to successfully pass through such postage rate increase directly to its clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant increases in the cost of paper  which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the availability of paper to print our clients advertising circulars 
paper costs have historically experienced significant fluctuations 
we currently have one long term contract with a single supplier for a minimum of approximately of our paper requirement 
the remainder of our paper requirements are subject to variable market prices for paper 
changes in the supply of  or demand for  paper could affect market prices or delivery times 
we do not engage in hedging activities to limit our exposure to increases in paper prices and we have a limited ability to pass increased costs along to our clients 
in the future  the price of paper may fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to paper in the necessary amounts or at reasonable prices or that any increases in paper costs would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the possibility of consolidation in our client base  the loss of clients to alternative advertising methods or decreases in the frequency or amount of clients mailings could impact our revenue growth and profitability 
in recent years there has been a growing trend toward retailer consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  the number of retailers to which we sell our products and services may decline and lead to a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  we may lose clients due to the acquisition of such clients companies that are not interested in using our products and services or that eliminate retail locations of our existing clients 
also  a client may decide to decrease its mailing frequency or modify the amount  pages and weight  and kind of advertising pieces it purchases from us  especially in light of the prolonged economic downturn 
our clients may be impacted by the items detailed above and by other general economic and business conditions that could affect their demand for our products and services and  in turn  choose other alternative advertising methods 
specifically  significant revenue changes in our shared mail segment may have a corresponding impact to profit due to the fixed cost nature of postage expense 
postage costs associated with advertising packages are fixed in nature for packages that weigh ounces or less  whether or not the package is partially or completely filled 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our clients may be susceptible to changes in general economic conditions 
our revenues are affected by our clients marketing spending and advertising budgets 
our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the geographic locations where we offer services or distribute content 
a continued economic downturn or a continued recession in these geographic locations may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to products and services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
we depend on vendors to timely supply us with quality materials at the right prices 
global economic and political conditions may affect our vendors 
a prolonged economic downturn could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable materials at affordable prices 
our inability to acquire suitable materials on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired  which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write off occurs 
our goodwill and intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
in addition  we review the carrying value of our long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including the market price of our common stock or the fair value of our debt  disruptions to our business  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the tangible and intangible assets  and mergers and acquisitions could result in an impairment charge for any of our long lived tangible and intangible assets or goodwill 
as a result of the decline in the trading value of our equity securities during the last quarter of and continuing negative industry and economic trends that directly affected our business during that time  we recorded a million pre tax  non cash impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets in december see critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets 
a continued decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about fair value of each of our reporting units  and we would be required to assess the recoverability of long lived and intangible assets  which could result in additional impairment charges 
any additional impairment charge related to our intangible assets  other long lived assets or goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain adequate internal controls may affect our ability to report timely and accurate financial statements and adversely affect our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that companies design and maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting and assess and report on such internal control structure annually 
such a system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
in addition  the design of any internal control system is based in part upon certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
there can be no assurance that our internal control systems and procedures will not result in or lead to a future material weakness  or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
furthermore  if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be impaired 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate  or if as a result we are unable to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  we may  among other things  experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
because we self insure a number of our benefit plans  unexpected changes in claim trends may negatively impact our financial condition 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation program and medical benefits claims 
while we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts  unexpected changes in claim trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  actuarial estimates and medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly different than initially reported 
if future claims related liabilities increase due to unforeseen circumstances  our self insurance costs could increase significantly 

table of contents due to uncertainty in the application and interpretation of applicable state sales tax laws  we may be exposed to additional sales tax liability 
the application and interpretation of applicable state sales tax laws to certain of our products is uncertain 
accordingly  we may be exposed to additional sales tax liability to the extent various state jurisdictions determine that certain of our products are subject to such jurisdictions sales tax 
we have recorded a liability of million  reflecting our best estimate of our potential sales tax liability 
while we believe all of our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and will be sustained upon audit  the actual liabilities may exceed such estimates 
if so  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions make budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce sales promotion spending 
the future direction of the overall domestic and global economies could have a significant impact on our business 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts has created worldwide uncertainties that may have a negative impact on demand for our products 
in addition  the economic downturn of the past two years has decreased the advertising budgets of our client base  which could have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting  as well as that of our clients  are dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets served and demand for our products and services  the global economic downturn of the past two years and related financial market uncertainties may render estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult to make than usual 
future events that may not have been anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risk factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are illustrative 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty

table of contents segment results shared mail the shared mail segment reported revenues of  million in compared to  million in  representing a decrease year over year 
the revenue decrease resulted from fewer packages due to the reduction of underperforming packages and client shifts to lower priced and lighter weight inserts

the adoption required retrospective application for all periods presented and is effective for our secured notes  substantially all of which we repurchased pursuant to a cash tender offer in may the debt component of the secured notes was recognized retrospectively at the present value of its cash flows discounted using a discount rate  our borrowing rate at the date of issuance of notes for a similar debt instrument without the conversion features 
the equity component  recorded as additional paid in capital  was million  which represents the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the secured notes and the fair value of the liability  net of deferred taxes of million as of the date of the issuance of the secured notes 
this retrospective adjustment is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets presented as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and which require them to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements included in item we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  mailing lists  customer relationships  trade names and goodwill 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  competition and other economic factors 
we have determined that our trade names have indefinite useful lives and  therefore  we do not amortize them 
we periodically review the carrying amounts of all of our long lived assets 
we undertake this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished  and at least annually in the fourth quarter in the case of trade names and goodwill 
the identification of units of accounting and the allocation of intangible assets by unit of accounting during were consistent with prior periods 
for goodwill  our annual impairment evaluation compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying amount and consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair values of each of our reporting units  as described below  and compare them to the corresponding carrying amounts 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner equivalent to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we perform our impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
based on the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist  we identified six reporting units as follows goodwill at dec 
 in millions shared mail nch marketing services  inc newspaper products valassis relationship marketing systems valassis in store solutions  inc solo direct mail the identification of reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to reporting units during were consistent with prior periods 

table of contents we estimate the fair values of our reporting units through a combination of income based and market based approaches 
we rely primarily on the income based approach and use the market based approach to validate the results 
the income based approach is based on projected future debt free cash flows that are discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows 
we believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operations and cash flow performance 
we estimate future cash flows for each of our reporting units based on our operating result projections for the respective operating unit 
these projected cash flows are discounted to present value using a weighted average cost of capital thought to be indicative of market participants 
at december   we used a discount rate of for all of our reporting units  except for valassis in store solutions for which we used  due to differences in industry and risk profile 
discount rates used in prior year testing ranged from to depending on each unit s risk profile 
the projections are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in our current operating plan 
in  we used unique revenue growth assumptions for each reporting unit  based on history and product characteristics  ranging from to growth of through  and used growth factors ranging from to calculate terminal value at the end of five years for each reporting unit 
the market based approach estimates fair value by applying trading multiples of potential earnings  such as ebitda  of other publicly traded companies within the industries our reporting units participate in to our reporting units 
we believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using trading multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to our reporting units 
based on the valuation approach described above  our estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units and no impairment charge was warranted as of december  a change in either the discount rates or revenue growth rates used in our analysis would not have a material effect on this conclusion 
consistent with the prior year  we tested the value assigned to our trade names utilizing an estimated market royalty rate representing the percentage of revenues a market participant would be willing to pay as a royalty for their use 
based on our analysis of market transactions  we used a royalty rate equivalent to the rate used in the prior year applied to future estimated revenue streams and performed a discounted cash flow analysis 
as of december   the resulting fair value based on this calculation  using a discount factor of down from in the prior year due to decreased market risk  which represented the weighted average cost of capital of market participants  indicated no impairment 
revenue recognition shared mail revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists and when services are rendered 
shared mail services are considered rendered when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the package has been shipped and accepted by the usps 
there is no risk pertaining to customer acceptance and the sales arrangement specifies a fixed and determinable price and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an allowance for sales adjustments to estimate claims resulting from billing and sales adjustments in the event of incorrect invoicing  pricing disputes or untimely mailings of clients advertising material 
the amount of this reserve is evaluated monthly taking into account historical trends  specific items and trended sales adjustments 
neighborhood targeted the majority of neighborhood targeted products are newspaper delivered  and revenues are recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenues are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
rop revenues are recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some clients have contracts whereby we earn a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the client 
in such cases  we only recognize the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
client contracts can vary  which may lead to material changes in revenues recognized for this segment  while not materially affecting absolute gross margin dollars 

table of contents fsi revenues from fsis and custom cooperative fsis are recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper or shared mail package 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pre bill fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date 
however  these billings are reflected as progress billings liability until the appropriate distribution period 
provision for rebates or pricing adjustments is made at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
international  digital media services revenues for coupon clearing do not include the face value of the coupons processed or the retailer service fee 
however  clients are billed for the face value and retailer fee which are included in both accounts receivable and accounts payable 
once coupon processing has been completed  fee revenues are recognized 
revenues for solo direct mail products are recognized when the product is accepted by the usps for insertion into the mail stream 
in most cases  postage costs are passed through directly to the client and are not recognized as revenue 
revenues from software products are recognized per installation  and revenues from services are recognized on a percent complete method 
stock compensation we grant stock options to our employees under various incentive plans 
options are granted with exercise prices at least equal to the fair value on the date of grant 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make various estimates in calculating expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for additional discussion of significant valuation assumptions 
client contract incentives we occasionally provide upfront cash incentives to key clients to secure the value of a long term contract 
the cost of such incentives are capitalized and amortized as a reduction to revenues over the life of the customer contract to match the associated value of the contract 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure along with assessing the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in the realization of deferred tax assets being materially different from amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item reserves for taxes are established for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
these tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as conclusion of tax audits  identification of new issues  changes in federal or state laws or interpretations of the law 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and interest rate swap contracts  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value and the changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives are not designated and do not qualify as effective hedges 
if a derivative is a fair value hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item 
if a derivative is a cash flow hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 

table of contents we formally document our hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
effective derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with fasb guidance  did not have a material impact on operations for  or other matters we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are interest rates on various debt instruments and foreign exchange rates at our international subsidiaries 
interest rates our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest calculated on either a prime rate or a eurodollar rate 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuating interest rates  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that expire december   which convert an aggregate of million  or  of our total variable rate debt under our senior secured credit facility  to fixed rate debt 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was a liability of million and an aggregate principal amount of million outstanding under the term loan b and delayed draw portions of our senior secured credit facility was subject to interest rate variability 
on december   we entered into an interest swap agreement which will initially convert million of our total variable rate debt under our senior secured credit facility to fixed rate debt 
the effective date of this agreement is december   which corresponds to the expiration date of the existing interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   the fair value of this derivative was an asset of million 
foreign currency currencies to which we have exposure are the mexican peso  canadian dollar  polish zloty  british pound and euro 
currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
we purchase the mexican peso and the polish zloty under two to twelve month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of production 
certain of our mexican peso forward exchange contracts were originally designated as cash flow hedges upon inception and  accordingly  the effective portion of any fair value change was recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and any ineffective portion was reflected in the statement of income 
actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase million in mexican pesos and million in polish zlotys over the next twelve months
