overview we are a leading provider of consumer products and services over the internet through a number of brands including ftd  interflora  classmates  netzero  and mypoints 
our ftd segment provides floral and related products and services to consumers and retail florists  as well as to other retail locations offering floral and related products and services 
our classmates media segment services are online social networking and online loyalty marketing 
our primary communications segment services are internet access and email 
on a combined basis  our web properties attract a significant number of internet users  and we offer a broad range of internet marketing services for advertisers 
segment definitions we report our businesses in three reportable segments segment products and services ftd floral and related products and services for consumers  retail florists and other retail locations classmates media online social networking and online loyalty marketing services communications internet access  email  internet security  and web hosting services 
table of contents key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our businesses  and to develop forecasts and budgets 
these key measures are ftd segment metrics consumer orders 
we monitor the number of consumer orders for floral and gift products during a given period 
consumer orders are orders delivered during the period that originated in the us and canada  primarily from the www 
ftd 
com web site and the send ftd telephone number  and in the uk and the republic of ireland  primarily from the www 
interflora 
co 
uk and www 
interflora 
ie web sites and a toll free telephone number 
orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included 
the number of consumer orders received may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to seasonality resulting from the timing of key holidays  general economic conditions  fluctuations in marketing expenditures on initiatives designed to attract new and retain existing customers  changes in pricing for our floral  plant and specialty gift products or competitive offerings  and changing consumer preferences  among other factors 
average order value 
we monitor the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period  which we refer to as the average order value 
average order value represents the average us dollar amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period 
this average us dollar amount is determined after translating the british pound amounts received for orders delivered in the uk and the republic of ireland into us dollars 
average order value includes merchandise revenue and shipping and service fees paid by the consumer  less certain discounts and certain refunds 
average order values may fluctuate from period to period based on the average foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound  product mix  changes in merchandise pricing  shipping and service fees  levels of certain refunds issued  and discounts  among other factors 
classmates media and communications segment metrics pay accounts 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from our pay accounts and they represent one of the most important drivers of our business model 
a pay account is defined as a member who has subscribed to  and paid for  our classmates media or communications services  and whose subscription has not expired 
a pay account does not equate to a unique subscriber since one subscriber could have several pay accounts 
at any point in time  our pay account base includes a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect 
in general  the key metrics that affect our revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and the average monthly revenue per pay account arpu 
a pay account generally becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription 
arpu 
we monitor arpu  which is calculated by dividing classmates media or communications services revenues  as applicable  for a period after translation into us dollars by the average number of segment pay accounts for that period  divided by the number of months in that period 
the average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and end of a period 
arpu may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans  the use of promotional or retention pricing to attract new  or retain existing  paying subscribers  increases or decreases in the price of our services  the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period  and the average foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 

table of contents churn 
to evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base  we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire  which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate 
our average monthly churn rate is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for the same period  divided by the number of months in that period 
our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms  which affects the timing of subscription expirations  and other factors 
we make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions 
for our communications segment pay accounts  we do not include in our churn calculation those accounts canceled during the first days of service unless the accounts have upgraded from free accounts  although a number of such accounts will be included in our account totals at any given measurement date 
subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have canceled a pay account depending on the services and  as such  our segment churn rates are not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers canceling any particular service 
active accounts 
we monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base 
classmates media segment active accounts are defined as the sum of all social networking pay accounts as of the date presented  the monthly average for the period of all free social networking accounts who have visited our domestic or international social networking web sites excluding the names database at least once during the period  and the monthly average for the period of all online loyalty marketing members who have earned or redeemed points during such period 
communications segment active accounts include all communications segment pay accounts as of the date presented combined with the number of free internet access and email accounts that logged on to our services at least once during the preceding days 
in general  we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers 
users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently 
we do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier 
as a result  total active accounts may not represent total unique users 
the table below sets forth  for the quarterly periods presented  as applicable  our consolidated revenues  pay accounts at the end of the period  segment revenues  consumer orders  average order value  average currency exchange rate  churn monthly average for the period  arpu monthly average for the period  and active accounts monthly average for the period 
revenues and operating results from our ftd segment are impacted by seasonal holiday timing variations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as such  we believe that comparisons of our ftd segment s revenues and operating results for any period with those of the immediately preceding period or  in some instances  the same period of the preceding fiscal year  may be of limited relevance in evaluating its historical financial performance and predicting its future financial performance 
the pay accounts and arpu metrics for our classmates media segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors including  but not limited to  the extent to which discounted pricing is offered in prior and current periods  the percentage of pay accounts being

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
the results of operations for interim or transition periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition ftd segment revenue recognition products revenues and related cost of revenues are generally recognized when products are delivered to the customers 
shipping and service fees charged to 
table of contents customers are recognized at the time the products revenue is recognized and are included in products revenue 
shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues 
ftd s consumer businesses generally recognize revenue on a gross basis as ftd bears the risks and rewards associated with the revenue generating activities by acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  being responsible for fulfillment of the order by our floral network members and third party suppliers  taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and marketing the products and services 
ftd also sells computer systems to its floral network members and recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software 
ftd recognizes revenue on hardware which is sold without software at the time of delivery 
for hardware sales that include software  revenue is recognized when delivery  installation and customer acceptance have all occurred 
services revenues based on enabling the delivery of orders by floral network members are generally recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered 
monthly  recurring fees and other floral network service based fees are recognized in the period in which the service has been provided 
classmates media segment and communications segment revenue recognition revenues are comprised of services revenues  which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts  and advertising revenues 
we apply the provisions of asc  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  no significant company obligations remain  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
services revenues for our online social networking services and communications services are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer 
our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their service by credit card  and revenue is then recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue 
we offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain pay service plans 
these alternative payment methods currently include use of ach  payment by personal check or money order  or payment through a local telephone company 
in circumstances where payment is not received in advance  revenue is only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues from our online social networking services and communications services consist primarily of amounts from internet search partners that are generated as a result of users utilizing partner internet search services  amounts generated from the display of third party offers at the end of classmates pay account registration process  amounts generated from other display advertisements  and amounts generated from referring members to third party web sites or services 
we recognize such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or  for performance based arrangements  when the related performance criteria are met 
in determining whether an arrangement exists  we ensure that a written contract is in place  such as a standard insertion order or a customer specific agreement 
we assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction 
the reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of internally tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and  when available  to third party or customer provided performance data 
advertising revenues for our online loyalty marketing service consist primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members  when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions 
each of these activities is a discrete  independent activity  which generally 
table of contents is specified in the sales agreement for each advertising customer 
as the earning activities take place  activity measurement data examples include the number of emails delivered and the number of responses received is accumulated and the related revenue is recorded 
probability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
deferred revenue also represents invoiced services that have not yet been performed 
business combinations all of our acquisitions occurred prior to the effective date of asc  business combinations  and accordingly  have been accounted for as purchase business combinations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the costs  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets acquired  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
consequently  to the extent an indefinite lived  definite lived or a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period 
definite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis 
we determine the appropriate amortization method by performing an analysis of expected cash flows over the estimated useful lives of the assets and match the amortization expense to the expected cash flows from those assets 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
two areas  in particular  that require significant judgment are estimating the fair value and related useful lives of identifiable intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we may obtain appraisals from valuation specialists for certain intangible assets 
while there are a number of different methods used in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets  there are two approaches primarily used the discounted cash flow and market comparison approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  terminal growth rate  subscriber churn  terminal value  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to market comparables 
most of the above assumptions are made based on available historical and market information 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management s estimate of their fair values 
we account for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which among other things  addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
asc prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires us to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
we test the goodwill of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events occur or circumstances 
table of contents change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets might be permanently impaired 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key management or other personnel  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units 
the determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally includes a study of market comparables  including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
indefinite lived intangible assets testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment requires a one step approach under asc we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently  if events occur or circumstances change that indicate they may be impaired 
the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are compared to their carrying values and if the carrying amount of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess 
the process of estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  and remaining economic lives of assets 
goodwill we operate in three reportable segments  in accordance with asc  segment reporting  and we have identified five reporting units ftd  interflora  classmates online  mypoints  and communications for purposes of evaluating goodwill 
these reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management 
the goodwill related to our acquired businesses is specific to each reporting unit and the goodwill amounts are assigned as such 
testing goodwill for impairment involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units with their respective net book values  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  including goodwill  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value  including goodwill  then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we performed step one of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our ftd  interflora  classmates online  mypoints  and communications reporting units exceeded their net book values  including goodwill 
accordingly  step two was not required 

table of contents the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables  including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections 
the estimated fair values for all of our reporting units were determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  a reporting unit s fair value is estimated based on the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method is dependent upon a number of factors  including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows  assumed discount rates and other assumptions 
under the market approach  using the guideline company method  a reporting unit s fair value is estimated based on multiples of the cash free market value of invested capital to revenue and adjusted ebitda of the guideline companies 
adjusted ebitda amounts excluded stock based compensation expense for the reporting units and guideline companies 
the revenue and adjusted ebitda multiples of our reporting units were selected based on a comparison of each reporting unit s operating performance and margins  among other factors  to those of the guideline companies 
based on our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate for each of our reporting units would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment 
a basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate for ftd would result in an indicated fair value that was higher than the carrying value of equity by million 
we believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessment are reasonable  but they are judgmental  and variations in any assumptions could result in a materially different calculation of the impairment amount  if any 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we account for identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management s estimate of their fair values 
we evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  shifts in technology  loss of key management or other personnel  significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in our operating model or strategy  and competitive forces 
in determining if an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair market value of the assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to ten years 
our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations 
we did not record any impairment charges related to our intangible assets in the year ended december  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as  but not limited to  the asset group to be tested for recoverability 
we are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the 
table of contents analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  and remaining economic lives of assets 
member redemption liability member redemption liability for online loyalty marketing points represents the estimated costs associated with the obligation of mypoints to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its online loyalty marketing members as well as those points purchased by its advertisers for use in such advertisers promotion campaigns as they have been earned by mypoints members  less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption 
the estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues  except for the portion related to member acquisition activities  internal marketing surveys and other non revenue generating activities  which are presented in sales and marketing expenses 
the member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points  less an allowance for points expected to expire  and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds or when points expire prior to redemption 
mypoints members may redeem points for third party gift cards and other rewards 
members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by mypoints  purchase goods or services from advertisers  engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers  or engage in other specified activities 
the member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future 
on a monthly basis  the weighted average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed 
mypoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members 
the discounts and points needed to redeem awards vary by merchant and award denomination 
mypoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards 
on a monthly basis  mypoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members 
this reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point earning trends  redemption activities and individual member account activity 
mypoints historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer  less an estimated reactivation rate  plus an estimate of future inactive points 
changes in  among other factors  the net number of points issued  redemption activities and members activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability 
a basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at december  by approximately points in active accounts do not expire  however  unredeemed points expire after twelve consecutive months of inactivity 
for purposes of the member redemption liability  inactive means a lack of all of the following web site visit  email response  survey completion  profile update  or any point earning or point redeeming transaction 
the canceling or disabling of inactive accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we fully consider inactive accounts when establishing the member redemption liability  as discussed above 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  a reconciliation of the changes in the member redemption liability in thousands year ended december  beginning balance accruals for points earned reduction for redeemed points converted points changes in allowance for points expected to expire and weighted average cost of points ending balance income taxes we account for income taxes under asc  income taxes 
under asc  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
under asc  we recognize  in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations 
we record liabilities related to pending litigation when an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we do not record liabilities for pending litigation when there are uncertainties related to assessing either the amount or the probable outcome of the claims asserted in the litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assess the potential liability related to such pending litigation

the year ended december  includes the results of ftd  which we acquired in august net income  adjusted for non cash items  increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in working capital  primarily related to a decrease in deferred revenue in  compared to the prior year period  resulting from an increase in the number of pay accounts with discounted promotional pricing plans in our classmates media segment as well as a reduction in the number of pay accounts with longer term plans in our communications segment 
net cash used for investing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to million in cash paid for our ftd acquisition in august the decrease was partially offset by a million decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments for the year ended december   compared to the prior year period  as a result of our decision to liquidate our short term investments portfolio in and a million increase in capital expenditures for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors including  without limitation  potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives  which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time 
additionally  technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment 
net cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to million in net proceeds from the uol credit agreement and the ftd credit agreement received for the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in payments on term loans of million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in net cash used for financing activities was also partially offset by a million decrease in the payment of dividends resulting from the decrease in our quarterly cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share of common stock subsequent to the ftd acquisition and a decrease in repurchases of common stock of million related to cash paid for employee tax withholding upon vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and upon the issuance of stock awards

the dividends were paid on february  may and august  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
following the closing of the ftd acquisition  united online  inc s board of directors decreased the cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share of common stock 
in october  united online  inc s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on november  and totaled million 
the payment of future dividends is discretionary and is subject to determination by united online  inc s board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and other factors 
in accordance with the terms of the ftd credit agreement  cash flows at ftd will  in general  not be available to united online  inc or segments other than the ftd segment 
in addition  the uol credit agreement imposes certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends or use cash flows from operations generated by our communications and classmates media segments for the benefit of our ftd segment 
future cash flows from financing activities may also be affected by our repurchases of our common stock 
united online  inc s board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program the program that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors through december  from august through december   we had repurchased a total of million of our common stock under the program 
we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under the program since february  and at december   the remaining amount available under the program was million 
the uol credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock 
cash flows from financing activities may also be negatively impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and stock awards we award to employees 
we currently do not collect the applicable employee withholding taxes from employees upon vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and upon the issuance of stock awards 
instead  we automatically withhold  from the restricted stock units that vest and the stock awards that are issued  the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the employee withholding taxes due 
we then pay the applicable withholding taxes in cash 
the withholding of these shares  although accounted for as a common stock repurchase  does not reduce the amount available under the program 
similar to repurchases of common stock under the program  the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities 
the amounts remitted in the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  for which we withheld  shares and  shares of common stock  respectively  that were underlying the restricted stock units and restricted stock awards which vested and stock awards that were issued 
the amount we pay in future quarters will vary based on our stock price and the number of restricted stock units vesting and stock awards being issued during the quarter 
based on our current projections  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations  at least in the next twelve months 
we may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund  among other things  both contractual payments and optional prepayments on the outstanding balances under the uol credit agreement and ftd credit agreement  dividend payments  if declared by united online  inc s board of directors  the 
table of contents development and or acquisition of other services  businesses or technologies  the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units and stock awards to pay the employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units and stock awards issued  the repurchase of our common stock under the program  and future capital expenditures 
under the terms of the uol credit agreement and the ftd credit agreement  there are significant limitations on our ability to use cash flows generated by our communications and classmates media segments for the benefit of the ftd segment and  conversely  there are significant limitations on our ability to use cash flows generated by the ftd segment for the benefit of united online  inc or the communications and classmates media segments 
our credit facilities include provisions which may require us to make debt prepayments in the event that we generate excess cash flow  as defined in the uol credit agreement and the ftd credit agreement  on a quarterly or annual basis  respectively 
the assessments of future excess cash flow for uol  excluding ftd  and for ftd on a standalone basis require us to forecast our respective cash flows from operations less certain cash outflows  including  but not limited to  those related to capital expenditures and income taxes 
based on our current projections  under the provisions of our credit facilities  we reasonably expect to make excess cash flow debt prepayments of approximately million in the next twelve months 
accordingly  this amount has been classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet at december  the determination of excess cash flow obligations requires us to make significant estimates regarding our cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  income taxes  and other items 
actual results could differ from our current projections and we could be required to pay materially different amounts under the excess cash flow provisions of our credit facilities 
the degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us 
we currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to fulfill our debt service obligations  at least in the next twelve months 
in addition  in  we made voluntary prepayments on the ftd credit agreement totaling million  eliminating all required payments in we have not yet determined whether we will make additional voluntary prepayments in if we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements  this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from  among other factors  developing new or enhancing existing services or products  repurchasing our common stock  acquiring other services  businesses or technologies or funding significant capital expenditures  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows as well as impair our ability to pay future dividends 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage of stock owned by the then current stockholders could be reduced 
furthermore  such equity or debt securities that we issue might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock 
in addition  the extreme volatility and disruption in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds  at least in the near term 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  deferred taxes  tax benefits from equity awards and changes in operating assets and liabilities

capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used for financing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to net proceeds from the uol credit agreement and the ftd credit agreement of million  partially offset by the repayment of ftd indebtedness of million in connection with the closing of the ftd acquisition and payments on the uol credit agreement and ftd credit agreement of million 
in addition  there was a million decrease in the payment of dividends resulting from the decrease in our quarterly dividend from per share of common stock to per share of common stock as discussed below 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a combined million decrease in proceeds from exercises of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan  a million increase in repurchases of common stock in connection with shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to pay applicable employee withholding taxes  and a million decrease in excess tax benefits from equity awards

in  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock for a total of million 
cash flows from financing activities were also negatively impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and stock awards we award to employees 
we did not collect the applicable employee withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards and upon the issuance of stock awards from employees 
instead  we automatically withheld  from the restricted stock units that vested and the stock awards that were issued  the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the employee withholding taxes due 
we then paid the applicable withholding taxes in cash

interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our cash  cash equivalents  and outstanding balances of the uol credit agreement and the ftd credit agreement 
the uol credit agreement bears interest at either libor plus per annum with a libor floor of or the prime rate plus per annum 
the interest rate set forth in the ftd credit agreement for loans made under the revolving credit facility and term loan a facility is either libor plus per annum with a libor floor of or the prime rate plus per annum  in each case  with step downs in the interest rate depending on ftd s leverage ratio 
the interest rate set forth in the ftd credit agreement for loans made under the term loan b facility is either libor plus per annum with a libor floor of or the prime rate plus per annum  in each case  with step downs in the interest rate depending on ftd s leverage ratio 
the ftd credit agreement also requires that ftd maintain one or more interest rate swap agreements  interest rate cap agreements  interest rate collar agreements  or other similar arrangements to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and exposures on its credit facilities with wells fargo bank  national association 
accordingly  in november  ftd group  inc entered into a three year interest rate cap instrument based on libor and a million notional amount of our ftd credit agreement 
at inception and at december   the interest rate cap instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge against expected future cash flows attributable to future libor interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the ftd credit agreement 
however  in january  as economic and capital market conditions continued to deteriorate  we determined that prime rate based borrowings were more attractive than libor based borrowings 
therefore  in january  the cash flow hedge was de designated and cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively 
as a result  subsequent fluctuations in the market value of the interest rate cap are recorded in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  gain as a result of such fluctuations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in our interest expense related to our debt of approximately million 
prior to  we had interest rate risk related to our short term investments portfolio 
as a result  we were exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
while we do not currently maintain any short term investments  we still maintain deposits which are classified as cash equivalents 
therefore  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us and certain foreign interest rates 
in the past  we typically have maintained a short term investments portfolio consisting  at times  of us commercial paper  us corporate notes  us government or us government agencies obligations  and municipal securities  including  prior to  auction rate securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our short term investments portfolio 
our principal objective in managing our short term investments is the preservation of principal and liquidity  while optimizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
the minimum long term credit rating is a  and if a long term credit rating is not available  we require a minimum short term credit rating of a and p furthermore  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our short term investments  at times in both fixed rate and variable rate interest earning instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  any future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal by selling securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents foreign currency risk we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound gbp  the euro eur  the indian rupee inr  and the canadian dollar cad  which may result in gains or losses reported in our earnings 
the volatilities in gbp  eur  inr  and cad and all other applicable foreign currencies are monitored by us throughout the year 
we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange rates translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
substantially all of the revenues of our foreign subsidiaries are received  and substantially all expenses are incurred  in currencies other than the us dollar  which increases or decreases the related us dollar reported revenues and expenses depending on the trend in currencies 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses 
a adverse change in overall foreign currency exchange rates over an entire year would result in a reduction of reported annual revenues of approximately million and a reduction of reported annual income before income taxes of approximately million 
these estimates assume an adverse shift in all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  which do not always move in the same direction or in the same degrees  and actual results may differ materially 
net foreign currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the second quarter of  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the economic effect of fluctuations in the us dollar against the british pound 
these derivatives were intended to minimize the foreign currency exchange rate impact of intercompany dividend payments in british pounds 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives were recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we may in the future also use other hedging programs  including derivative financial instruments commonly utilized  if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
at december   there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
