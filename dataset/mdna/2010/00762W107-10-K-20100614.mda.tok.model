our membership business model allows us to create value for our members by providing quality content on a broad set of relevant issues as well as proven solutions to common and complex problems 
our growth has been driven by strong renewal rates  ongoing addition of new memberships in our existing programs  acquisition activity  continued new program launches  and continued annual price increases 
our member institution renewal rate in each of the past three years was   and for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we believe high renewal rates are a reflection of our members recognition of the value they derive from participating in our programs 
our revenue grew in fiscal over fiscal and grew in fiscal over fiscal our contract value increased to at march  when compared to march  and remained constant at march  when compared to march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
memberships in of our programs are renewable at the end of their membership contract term  and contract terms generally run one  two  or three years 
our other ten programs provide installation support and management and advisory services 
memberships in these ten programs help members accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies and are not individually renewable 
as of march   approximately of our contract value was renewable 
in each of our programs  we generally invoice and collect fees in advance of accrual revenue

net income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in net income during fiscal was primarily due to lower revenue growth of  compared to expense growth of due to increases in costs to serve members  costs associated with the launch of new programs  and an increase in the number of new sales teams 
the decrease in net income during fiscal was primarily due to two non cash charges and acquisition related costs incurred during fiscal  netted by revenue growth of 
during fiscal certain members of senior management and the board of directors voluntarily surrendered for cancellation a total of  options that had exercise prices between per share and per share 
this cancellation led to a nonrecurring non cash charge during the year of million 
in addition  we recognized a million non cash charge during fiscal resulting from the write off of capitalized software 

table of contents revenue 
total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal our contract value remained constant at million from march  to march   and increased to million as of march  the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to cross selling existing programs to existing members  the introduction and expansion of new programs  the acquisition of crimson software  inc crimson  and  to a lesser degree  the addition of new member organizations and price increases

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to increased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools of million which includes acquired developed technology associated with the acquisition of crimson of million 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to increased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools of million as well as increased depreciation expense related to the expansion of additional floors in our headquarters facility under the terms of our lease agreement 
write off of capitalized software

table of contents other income  net 
other income  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal other income  net consisted solely of interest income for fiscal  and consisted of interest income and a foreign exchange rate loss in fiscal  and consisted of interest income and a foreign exchange rate gain in interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal due to lower interest rates and lower average invested cash balances resulting from the crimson and southwind acquisitions in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we recognized a foreign exchange loss of million and a foreign exchange gain of  respectively  due to the effect of fluctuating currency rates on our receivable balances from international members 
the effect of the movement in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of income statement was immaterial during fiscal provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal due to the positive effect on our effective tax rate of certain washington  dc income tax credits  for which we qualify under the new e conomy transformation act of the act  as our net income has decreased 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal is due primarily to an increase in our washington  dc statutory income tax rate from to as of january  in accordance with the act 
stock based compensation expense

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity and we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to support operating and capital expenditures  as well as share repurchases and potential acquisitions  during the next months 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances of million and million as of march  and  respectively

we have no long term indebtedness 
cash flows from operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth  profitable operations  and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in net income during the same period 
the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to acceleration in contract value and deferred revenue growth  as well as the impact of the write off of capitalized software of million and the million non cash charge associated with the cancellation of certain stock options 
cash flows from investing activities 
our cash management and investment strategy and capital expenditure programs affect investing cash flows

credit facilities 
in november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that can be used for working capital  share repurchases  or other general corporate purposes 
borrowings on the credit facility  if any  will be collateralized by certain of our marketable securities and will bear interest at an amount based on the published libor rate 
we are also required to maintain an interest coverage ratio for each of our fiscal years of not less than three to one 
the credit facility 
table of contents renews automatically each year until  and can be increased at our request by up to an additional million per year up to million in the aggregate 
there have been no borrowings under the credit facility 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations relate primarily to our headquarters and other offices leases  which are more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements  and payments related to our acquisition of crimson  which are more fully described in note  acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases milestone payments relating to acquisition of crimson in connection with the acquisition of crimson  we are required to pay up to million of additional cash payments that will become due and payable as certain milestones are met over the evaluation period beginning at the acquisition date through march  we paid million in cash for achievement of some of these milestones in the fiscal years ended march  and as of march   the remaining balance of these cash payments was approximately million 
share repurchase in april  our board of directors authorized a million increase in the repurchase of our common stock  which increased the total authorized repurchase amount to million

summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed 
table of contents discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectability is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable during the subsequent twelve month period and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees  if earlier 
in many of our higher priced programs and membership agreements with terms that are greater than one year  fees may be billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to the service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
revenue from renewable memberships and best practices installation support memberships is recognized ratably over the term of the related subscription agreement 
certain membership programs incorporate hosted business intelligence and software tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based business intelligence tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally one to three years 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a business intelligence software tool  all program revenue is deferred until the tool is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 
one of our programs includes delivered software tools together with implementation services  technical support  and related membership services 
for these arrangements  we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized as services are performed using project hours as the basis to measure progress towards completion 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
multiple contracts with a single member are treated as separate arrangements for revenue recognition purposes 
we also perform professional services sold under separate agreements that include management and consulting services 
we recognize professional services revenues on a time and materials basis as services are rendered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific member collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions  and current economic trends 
property and equipment property and equipment consists of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  equipment  capitalized internal software development costs  and acquired developed technology 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in certain membership programs  we provide software tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on our service providers hardware 
the members do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the business intelligence and software tools during the term of their membership agreement 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
capitalized software is amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  which is generally five years 
replacements and major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the acquired developed technology is classified as property and equipment because the developed software application resides on our service providers hardware 
amortization for acquired developed software is included in the depreciation and amortization line item of our consolidated statements of income 
acquired developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of nine years based on the cash flow estimate used to determine the value of the intangible asset 
furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term 

table of contents business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in valuation allowance are recognized as a reduction or increase to expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
we capitalize any acquired in process research and development as an intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
as a result of our adoption of the revised accounting guidance for business combinations as of the beginning of fiscal  acquisition related costs are now recorded as expenses in our consolidated financial statements that would previously have been capitalized as a part of the purchase price pursuant to previous accounting rules 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis at march st  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
we have concluded that our reporting units that we use to assess goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 
finite lived intangible assets are required to be amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets consist of capitalized software for sale and acquired intangibles 
we capitalize consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine that technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the weighted average estimated useful life of capitalized software is five years 
other intangible assets include those assets that arise from business combinations consisting of developed technology  non competes  trademarks  contracts  and customer relationships that are amortized  on a straight line basis  over six months to ten years 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges direct incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data  and software incorporated in specific memberships that include business intelligence tools  and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 

table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  temporary differences arise as a result of the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax law and tax rates on the date of the enactment of the change 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation cost based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards on the grant date 
stock based compensation costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
we calculate the grant date estimated fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the estimated fair value of stock based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the stock based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of our shares  and forfeiture rates of the awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
our fair value estimates are based on assumptions we believe are reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of rsus is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
we also report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation  or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  amongst other potential factors  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
as of march   our marketable securities consisted of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or 
table of contents income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material 
with respect to recent global economic events  there is an unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets  which could bring potential liquidity risks to us 
such risks could include additional declines in our stock value  less availability and higher costs of additional credit  potential counterparty defaults  and further commercial bank failures 
we do not believe that the value or liquidity of its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  as described above  have been significantly impacted by the recent credit crisis 
in addition  we constantly monitor the credit worthiness of our members and we believe that our current group of members are sound and represent no abnormal business risk 
foreign currency risk 
although it represents approximately of our revenue  our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations 
prices for our services sold to members located outside the united states are sometimes denominated in local currencies primarily british pound sterling 
as a consequence  increases in the us dollar against local currencies in countries where we have members would result in a foreign exchange loss recognized by us 
in   and  we recorded foreign currency exchange losses gains of zero  million  and  respectively  which is included in other income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position as of march
