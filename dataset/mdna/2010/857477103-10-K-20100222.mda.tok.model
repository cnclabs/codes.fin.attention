the decline in total revenue also reflected the absence of the million gain from the sale of our joint venture interest in citistreet in servicing and management fees were down and  respectively  from  mainly due to the impact of declines in equity market valuations  partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue 
trading services revenue declined to billion from billion  primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange trading volumes  offset by an increase in brokerage fees and other trading services revenue from higher transitions and electronic trading revenues attributable to higher volumes

processing fees and other revenue decreased to million from million due to lower product related revenue 
net interest revenue decreased to billion compared to billion for  or on a fully taxable equivalent basis billion compared to billion  reflecting increases from tax equivalent adjustments of million and million  respectively

total revenue years ended december  change dollars in millions fee revenue servicing fees management fees trading services securities finance processing fees and other total fee revenue net interest revenue interest revenue interest expense net interest revenue gains losses related to investment securities  net gain on sale of citistreet interest  net of exit and other associated costs total revenue our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by securities finance  trading services and processing fee and other revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities  by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 

table of contents fee revenue servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately of our total fee revenue for and for these fees are a function of several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by customers  and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations 
generally  servicing fees are affected  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration  while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  balance credits  customer minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors  may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products 
enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements 
performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
generally  we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
we would expect the foregoing relationships to exist in normalized financial markets 
these relationships were not experienced in or  in light of the global financial markets disruption that began in these disrupted conditions adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues for and  which are based  in part  on the value of assets under custody and administration or assets under management as described earlier in this section 
in addition  our revenues from trading services and securities finance during were adversely affected by a reduction in the significant volatility in the financial markets experienced during associated with the aforementioned disruption 
even though the market disruption lessened during this year s third and fourth quarters  the impact of market conditions on our total revenue for the year was more significant than we would anticipate in normalized markets

table of contents at year end  our total assets under custody and administration were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the increase compared to was primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new business 
the value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the value of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue

ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr gold etf 
the decline in management fees from resulted primarily from the impact of declines in average month end equity market valuations and the impact of a higher percentage of assets invested in lower rate passive strategies  partly offset by the impact of new business on current period revenue

the overall increase in assets under management at december  compared to december  primarily reflected an aggregate increase in net new business of approximately billion  compared to an aggregate net loss of business of approximately billion during  and increases in equity market valuations 
our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors  including investor issues related to ssga s active fixed income strategies  restrictions on redemptions related to funds engaged in securities lending  and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products

table of contents the following table presents a roll forward of assets under management for the three years ended december assets under management years ended december  in billions balance at beginning of year net new business market appreciation depreciation balance at end of year trading services trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading services 
we offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency market risks 
for  foreign exchange trading revenue totaled million  a decrease from revenue of billion  mainly driven by a decline in customer volumes and a decrease in currency volatility  as the financial markets were relatively more stable during than during we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees of million were higher by compared to million in the increase was attributable to higher brokerage revenue  principally from growth in fixed income transition management and equity trading  as well as to an increase in revenues from electronic trading services associated with higher volumes 
securities finance securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets  as well as an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their securities portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage of the fair value of the loaned securities 
as the fair value of the loaned securities changes  additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower 
such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments 
for cash collateral  we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities 
in some cases  the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by ssga 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue  composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral  is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral 
for  securities finance revenue decreased from a year earlier  primarily as a result of compression of spreads across all lending programs as well as a decrease in the average volume of securities on loan during compared to 
table of contents market influences are expected to continue to affect our revenue from  and the profitability of  our securities lending activities in over the past months  the aggregate volume of securities on loan under our direct lending program has decreased significantly  from an average of approximately billion of aggregate securities on loan during the second quarter of to approximately billion during the fourth quarter of and approximately billion during the fourth quarter of this decline in average lending volume reflects both the general de leveraging of the securities markets following the lehman bankruptcy proceedings and  to a lesser degree  regulatory measures affecting securities lending 
at the same time  during  the spreads  described above  earned by participants decreased significantly  reflecting prevailing interest rates and government actions to stimulate the economy 
until securities lending volumes and spreads return to more normal levels  our revenues from securities lending activities will be adversely affected  which in turn may discourage customers who exited securities lending in and from returning to the practice 
purported class actions have been filed regarding certain collateral pools underlying funds managed by ssga  and we are responding to inquiries from the sec and other regulatory authorities in connection with our cash collateral pools 
additional information is included in the risk factors and legal proceedings sections included under items a and  respectively 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  equity income from our joint venture investments  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue was million for  a decrease of compared to this decrease was mainly the result of declines in fees from our deposit service and structured products businesses  including our tax exempt investment and conduit commercial paper programs  the latter the result of the may conduit consolidation 
prior to the conduit consolidation  we earned administrative fees for providing administrative services to each of the conduits  which generally represented the conduits residual earnings after the payment of interest on outstanding commercial paper and the payment of other fees to independent third parties 
we earned fee revenue of approximately million for up to the date of the consolidation  compared to million for all of and million for all of since the conduits assets and liabilities are now recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  the conduits business activities generate net interest revenue rather than processing fees and other revenue

changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below 
additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents for  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest revenue decreased on a gaap basis compared to this decline was generally the result of lower rates on floating rate investment securities and both lower volumes and lower rate spreads on customer deposits  as well as the re investment of amortizing and maturing investment securities into short term interest bearing deposits rather than investment securities during the first half of  in connection with our previously announced plan to improve our tangible common equity 
the decrease in fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue was partially offset by discount accretion  described below  on securities added in connection with the may conduit consolidation 
average aggregate interest bearing deposits decreased compared to  primarily due to the current low yield environment and a decrease in customers cash balances more reflective of historical levels as global market disruptions lessened 
in may  we elected to take action that required the consolidation onto our balance sheet  for financial reporting purposes  of the assets and liabilities of the asset backed commercial paper conduits that we sponsored and administered 
upon consolidation  the aggregate fair value of the conduits investment securities was established as their carrying amount  resulting in a discount to the assets par value 
to the extent that the expected future cash flows from the securities exceed their carrying amount  the portion of the discount not related to credit will accrete into interest revenue over the securities remaining terms 
the timing and ultimate recognition of this accretion will depend on factors including future credit conditions and the timing of underlying collateral prepayment  the predictability of which is challenged by the continuing global financial markets disruption 
during  we recorded discount accretion in interest revenue of approximately million  and we anticipate that discount accretion will continue to be a material component of our net interest revenue for because the rate of recognition of discount accretion is dependent  in part  on the rate of underlying prepayments  which is beyond our control  the volatility of our net interest revenue may increase 
interest bearing deposits with banks  including cash balances held at the federal reserve to satisfy reserve requirements  averaged billion for  relatively flat compared to billion in an average of billion was held at the federal reserve bank during  an increase of billion compared to billion for  with the balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements 
this increase resulted from our investment of excess liquidity  beginning in the second half of  in reserve balances held at the federal reserve bank 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  these balances earn a minimal rate of interest  which rate is subject to change at the federal reserve s discretion 
average securities purchased under resale agreements decreased  or billion  from billion for to billion for average federal funds sold decreased billion  or  to million for compared to the decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements was mainly due to the re allocation of liquidity to us treasury securities in the investment securities portfolio and the placement of excess liquidity at the federal reserve  as described above  and other central banks 
average trading account assets decreased  or million  from billion for to billion in  due to the absence of conduit asset backed commercial paper which was eliminated for financial reporting purposes when the conduits were consolidated onto our balance sheet as described above 
our average investment securities portfolio increased  or billion  from billion in to approximately billion in  due to the effect of the conduit consolidation and an increase in us treasury and agency securities  as well as the re investment of amortizing and maturing securities  partially offset by sales 
during the second half of  we re initiated our investment strategy of investing in aaa and aa rated securities 
securities rated aaa and aa comprised approximately of the investment securities portfolio  with approximately aaa rated  at december   compared to aaa and aa rated and aaa rated  respectively  at december  loans and leases averaged billion for the  down from billion for the decrease was primarily related to lower levels of short term liquidity required by customers  partially offset by the structured asset backed loans added in connection with the conduit consolidation 
approximately of the average loan and lease portfolio  compared to for  was composed of us and us short duration advances that provide liquidity to customers in support of their transaction flows  which averaged approximately billion for  down billion  or  from billion for the lower levels of liquidity we 
table of contents provided to customers during were due to a decrease in customer demand and not a reduction in credit availability from  or committed lines provided by  state street 
as transaction flows returned to more normalized levels compared to the extraordinarily high levels experienced in  customer demand for short term liquidity declined 
average interest bearing deposits decreased billion  or  from billion to billion for compared to the decrease was due to lower levels of us and us deposits  including foreign transaction deposits  which were particularly high during this decrease also reflected the current low yield interest rate environment and a decrease in customers cash balances  the latter more reflective of historical levels as global market disruptions lessened 
average other short term borrowings increased billion  or  to billion for primarily due to the addition of commercial paper in connection with the conduit consolidation and borrowings under the federal reserve s term auction facility  which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions  to fund conduit assets 
average long term debt increased billion  or  to billion for due to the issuance of an aggregate of approximately billion of unsecured senior notes by state street and state street bank in march under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  and the issuance by state street of million of unsecured senior notes in may several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin  including the mix of customer liabilities  actions of the various central banks  changes in us and us interest rates  the shapes of the various yield curves around the world and the amount of discount accretion on the investment securities added to our consolidated balance sheet in connection with the conduit consolidation 
based on market conditions  we re initiated our investment strategy of re investing proceeds from amortizing and maturing securities in highly rated investment securities  such as us treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  which enhanced our net interest revenue and margin during the second half of the pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on market conditions over time 
these factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what impact the re investment program will have on our net interest revenue and net interest margin in the future

the growth in trading services revenue was the result of higher levels of currency volatility in foreign exchange trading  as well as the contribution of revenue of both the acquired investors financial business with 
table of contents respect to foreign exchange and the acquired currenex business with respect to brokerage and other for a full year 
brokerage and other trading revenue increased from to  due to higher revenues from electronic trading  both from the acquired currenex business and from our global link product  as well as an increase in brokerage revenue  principally transition management and equity trading 
securities finance revenue for was up compared to  primarily as a result of wider credit spreads across all lending programs 
spreads benefited from the federal reserve s aggregate basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during  as well as from the continued disruption of the global fixed income securities markets 
the increases were offset partially by a decline in lending volumes 
the increase in servicing fees was the result of the inclusion of servicing fee revenue from the acquired investor financial business for a full year  the impact of new business on revenue and higher transaction volumes 
approximately of our servicing fees were derived from non us customers in each of and management fees decreased from to  billion to billion respectively  primarily from the impact of declines in average month end equity market valuations and performance fees 
approximately of our management fees were derived from customers outside the us in  down from for assets under management decreased to trillion at december   down billion from trillion a year earlier  as we experienced a net loss of business and  more significantly  market depreciation 
the increase in net interest revenue was the result of several favorable trends 
interest earning assets and related net interest revenue from the acquired investors financial business and widening spreads on fixed rate and tax exempt investment securities were the primary reasons for the growth

the overall effective tax rate for was compared to for significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item the majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements  interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment  
table of contents and goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining and audit committee of our board of directors 
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  including trading account assets  investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments 
as discussed in further detail below  changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income  or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition 
in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements  we disclose the estimated fair value in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of other of our financial assets and liabilities that are carried at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition 
we estimate the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below 
at december   approximately billion of our financial assets and approximately billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the amounts at december  represented approximately of our consolidated total assets and approximately of our consolidated total liabilities  compared to and  respectively  at december  the increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets as of december  resulted primarily from the addition of investment securities in connection with the conduit consolidation and portfolio purchases of investment securities 
the decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total liabilities as of december  resulted from lower levels of derivatives related to our foreign exchange activities 
as described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item  we adopted new accounting standards that govern fair value measurement effective january  these accounting standards do not require us to measure our financial assets and liabilities at fair value  but provide a consistent definition of fair value and provide a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap 
these standards also provided for the election of a fair value option for assets and liabilities not previously carried at fair value on a recurring basis 
in connection with our application of these accounting standards  we have not elected the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities since adoption  although we may do so in the future 
the accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact  and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical  or similar  financial assets or liabilities 
when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
in some instances  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets  and as a result we use alternative valuation techniques to measure their fair value 
in accordance with the standards  we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based upon the standards three level valuation hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
table of contents liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level 
we categorized approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in level  in level and in level of the fair value hierarchy  including the effect of master netting agreements 
we categorized approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  with the remaining in level  including the effect of master netting agreements 
the fair value of the investment securities categorized in level was composed of us treasury securities  specifically treasury bills  which have a maturity of one year or less 
fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
the fair value of the investment securities categorized in level was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties 
information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process 
management utilizes a process to review information provided by third parties  including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions 
in addition  management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information 
such information may include known trades or  to the extent that trading activity is limited  comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations  execution prices and the timing of cash flows 
the fair value of the derivative instruments categorized in level predominantly represented foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities  for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points  as well as observable interest rate curves 
with respect to derivative instruments  we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit 
we considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties  our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value 
valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for or while the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level were composed of asset backed securities available for sale  level also included foreign exchange derivatives 
the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level as of december   compared to december   decreased approximately  and was primarily composed of transfers of asset backed securities  principally those collateralized by student loans  to level interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated balance sheet is our portfolio of fixed income investment securities 
at december   this portfolio included securities added as a result of the may conduit consolidation 
additional information with respect to the conduits and the consolidation is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item as discussed below  the estimation of future cash flows from the securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to our fixed income investment securities 
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant estimates underlying our determination of expected future cash flows 
in determining these estimates  management relies on relevant and reliable information  including but not limited to deal structure  including optional and mandatory calls  market interest rate curves  industry standard asset class specific prepayment models  recent prepayment history  independent credit ratings  and recent actual and projected credit losses 
management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates 
management reviews its underlying assumptions and determines expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly 
additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided in the financial condition investment securities section of this management s discussion and analysis 

table of contents interest revenue recognition our investment portfolio  excluding the conduit assets  consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amount 
in connection with the conduit consolidation  we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount 
to the extent that future cash flows from these securities is expected to exceed their recorded carrying amounts  the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining lives 
as a result of the magnitude of the discount  the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue have become significant 
a portion of the conduit securities  primarily asset backed securities  had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation  or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that are not of high credit quality  and therefore are accounted for pursuant to specific accounting guidance 
as a result  interest revenue recognition for these securities differs from the accounting for the remainder of our portfolio 
the accounting for these securities requires an estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal  interest and other contractual cash flows  and the calculation of an effective yield based upon these estimates is used to record interest revenue 
generally  the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain  due to the unknown timing and amount of principal payments including potential credit losses and the variability of future interest rates 
other than temporary impairment existing accounting standards also require the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities 
the amount and timing of expected cash flows is a significant estimate in the determination of other than temporary impairment 
additional information with respect to management s assessment of impairment is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount 
as required by gaap  we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  based on undiscounted cash flows 
substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business 
the remainder is recorded by investment management 
the sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach  based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  or an income approach  based on the value of the cash flows the business can be expected to generate in the future 
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate 
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets  including information by line of business  is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in indicated that none was impaired 
goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at december  totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively

additional information about the amlf  which recently expired  is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item overview of consolidated statement of condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition  or balance sheet  is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
as our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers 
our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments  such as interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
table of contents agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets

table of contents impairment net unrealized losses on securities available for sale were as follows as of december in millions fair value amortized cost net unrealized loss  pre tax net unrealized loss  after tax the above net unrealized loss amounts at december  and december  excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of billion  or million after tax  and billion  or billion after tax  respectively  related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity 
these after tax amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the decline in the remaining after tax unrealized loss amounts related to transferred securities resulted from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other than temporary impairment on certain of the securities 
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified  the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component 
the credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income  and the non credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security specific factors  which are more fully described in note such factors are based upon estimates  derived by management  which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance 
to the extent that market conditions are worse than management s expectations  other than temporary impairment could increase  in particular the credit component that would be recognized in our consolidated statement of income 
national housing prices  according to the case shiller national hpi  have declined to date approximately peak to current 
management currently estimates that national housing prices will continue to decline and bottom out during the second half of  consistent with a peak to trough housing price decline of approximately 
as an indication of the sensitivity of our portfolio with respect to our more significant assumptions underlying our assessment of impairment  if we were to increase our default estimates to of management s current expectations with a corresponding slowing of prepayment speeds to of management s current expectations  credit related other than temporary impairment could increase by approximately million to million  which impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded  management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities 
additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents loans and lease financing us and us loans and lease financing  and average loans and lease financing  were as follows for the years ended december excluding the allowance for losses in millions us commercial and financial purchased receivables lease financing total us non us commercial and financial purchased receivables lease financing total non us total loans average loans and lease financing us commercial and financial loans at december  and included approximately million and million  respectively  of commercial real estate loans acquired in pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman 
the loans  which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate  were recorded at their then current fair value on the date acquired 
fair value represented management s expectation  as of the date of acquisition  with respect to future collection of principal and interest  using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition 
as of the date of acquisition  management considered it probable that all contractual payments would not be collected  and accordingly reflected that assumption in the measurement of the loans aggregate fair value 
pursuant to current accounting standards  management is required to periodically reassess its cash flow expectations with respect to these loans  and recognize the impact of any changes in expected future cash flows in consolidated results of operations through an adjustment to a valuation allowance and  in some cases  an adjustment to the yield of the loans 
if expected future cash flows from these loans are adversely affected by further deterioration of conditions in the commercial real estate markets or by other factors  we could be required to record additional adjustments to the valuation allowance in our consolidated results of operations 
we define past due loans as loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but for which interest continues to be accrued 
although a portion of these commercial real estate loans is days or more contractually past due  we do not report them as past due loans  because under current accounting standards  the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from management s expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date  not the loans contractual payment terms 
these cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in management s expectations  which consider market conditions 
we generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
at december   approximately million of the aforementioned commercial real estate loans had been placed by management on non accrual status  as the yield associated with these loans  determined when the loans were acquired  was deemed to be non accretable 
this determination was based on management s expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans 
future changes in expectations with respect to collection of principal and interest on these loans could result in additional non accrual loans and provisions for loan losses 
there were no non accrual loans at year end   or 
table of contents the aggregate increase in loans and lease financing from reflected the addition of billion of structured asset backed loans  presented in the preceding table as purchased receivables  in connection with the may conduit consolidation  partially offset by a decrease in short duration advances  which result primarily from securities settlement activities of our customers 
such advances included in loans were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
average advances were approximately billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower levels of these advances for resulted from a decrease in customer demand and not a reduction in credit availability from  or committed lines provided by  state street 
as transaction flows returned to more normalized levels compared to the extraordinarily high levels experienced in  customer demand for such short term advances declined 
these advances do not represent significant credit risk because of their short term nature  which is generally overnight  the lack of significant concentration  and their occurrence in the normal course of the cash and securities settlement process

this portion of the provision was reflective of changes in management s expectations with respect to future principal and interest cash flows from these loans 
the changes in expectations were primarily based on the assessment of the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in the commercial real estate markets on these loans during of the remaining provision of million  million related to the results of the federal reserve s shared national credit review 
the charge offs of million in primarily related to the commercial real estate loans  as management considered certain of these loans no longer collectible 
cross border outstandings cross border outstandings  as defined by bank regulatory rules  are amounts payable to state street by residents of foreign countries  regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated  and local country claims in excess of local country obligations 
these cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks  loan and lease financing and investment securities 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least of our consolidated total assets were as follows as of december in millions united kingdom australia canada netherlands germany total cross border outstandings the total cross border outstandings presented in the table represented  and of our consolidated total assets as of december   and  respectively

and of our consolidated total assets as of december  capital the management of regulatory and economic capital both involve key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our regulatory capital requirements  the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers 
our capital committee  working in conjunction with our asset and liability committee  referred to as alco  oversees the management of regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
tier and total risk based capital and tier leverage ratios exclude the impact  where applicable  of the asset backed commercial paper purchased under the federal reserve s amlf  as permitted by the amlf s terms and conditions 
at december   state street s and state street bank s tier and total risk based capital ratios decreased compared to year end with respect to state street  the loss associated with the may conduit consolidation and the june redemption of the equity received from the us treasury in connection with the tarp capital purchase program  partly offset by the aggregate impact of the may public offering 
table of contents of common stock and net income before the conduit loss  reduced tier and total risk based capital 
with respect to state street bank  the loss associated with the conduit consolidation  partly offset by the impact of net income before the conduit loss  reduced tier and total risk based capital 
the impact on the ratios of the decreases in tier and total risk based capital described above was partly offset by decreases in total risk weighted assets for both entities  as increases in investment securities from both the conduit consolidation and our investment portfolio re investment program were more than offset by a reduction in aggregate balance sheet assets  generally due to lower levels of excess liquidity  as noninterest bearing customer deposits returned to more normal levels during the second half of as market conditions stabilized 
all ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
capital purchase program in october  in connection with the us treasury s capital purchase program  we issued  shares of our series b fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock   liquidation preference per share  and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  to treasury  and received aggregate proceeds of billion 
the aggregate proceeds were allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance 
as a result  approximately billion and million  respectively  were allocated to the preferred stock and the warrant 
the difference between the initial value of billion allocated to the preferred stock and the liquidation amount of billion was intended to be charged to retained earnings and credited to the preferred stock over the period that the preferred stock was outstanding  using the effective yield method 
the preferred shares qualified as tier regulatory capital  and paid cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of per year 
the warrant was immediately exercisable  and originally had a year term 
the exercise price of per share was based upon the average of the closing prices of our common stock during the trading day period prior to our election to participate in the program 
in june  subsequent to the may public offering described below under common stock  we repaid the full amount of treasury s billion equity investment by redeeming all of the outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock at its aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued dividends  or approximately billion 
the excess of the aggregate liquidation amount over the then billion carrying value of the preferred stock  which totaled approximately million  was prepaid and recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 
in july  we repurchased the common stock warrant  issued to treasury as part of its overall investment  at its fair value of million 
the number of shares underlying the warrant then held by treasury had been reduced by one half of the original number of common shares underlying the warrant as a result of the may public offering described below under common stock 
the repurchase of the warrant reduced shareholders equity  because it was recorded as a reduction of surplus 
common stock in may  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the offering price was per share  and aggregate proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs  totaled approximately billion 
underwriting commissions totaled approximately million 
in june  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the public offering price was per share  and aggregate proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs  totaled approximately billion 
underwriting commissions totaled approximately million 
of the total shares issued  approximately million shares were issued out of treasury stock  and the remaining million shares were newly issued 
no shares of our common stock were purchased during under existing board authorization 
as of december   approximately million shares remained available for future purchase under the board authorization 
in january  under an existing authorization by our board of directors  we purchased 
table of contents  shares of our common stock  at an average historical cost per share of approximately  in connection with a billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on january  we generally employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock  which totaled million per share in compared to million and per share in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board of directors considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
during the first quarter of  in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of  and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity  we announced a reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to per share 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item other the current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the us banking regulators are based on a international accord  commonly referred to as basel i  which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework  referred to as basel ii 
basel ii governs the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations  such as state street  that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems  and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks 
basel ii comprises a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum regulatory capital requirements  which incorporate the measurement of credit risk  market risk and operational risk  supervisory review  which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk profile  including additional risks related to interest rate sensitivity  business model strategies and overall diversification benefits  rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirements  and market discipline  which imposes more detailed public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organization s risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital 
in december  us banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the basel ii framework in the us implementation is subject to multi year transition periods during which floors are established to limit the amounts by which minimum required capital may decrease 
the framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the us  and explicitly preserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate 
basel ii s global regulatory reach  combined with recent market dynamics affecting a broad spectrum of financial institutions worldwide  make it likely further regulatory changes will be proposed in the future 
state street has established a comprehensive program to implement the basel ii framework and underlying regulatory requirements within the prescribed time frames 
we anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing our capital adequacy under the requirements 
economic capital we define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt  and obligations higher in priority  against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa senior debt rating 
economic capital requirements are one of several important measures used by management and the board to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to state street s risk profile 
our capital committee is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process 

table of contents the framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our enterprise risk management  global treasury and corporate finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and the new basel ii regulatory capital adequacy framework 
this economic capital framework has been approved by senior management and the risk and capital committee of the board 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies  assumptions  and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities  interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities  credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty  operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition  and business risk the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks 
economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction  or diversification benefit  is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
significant uses of liquidity  described more fully below  consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure 
our global treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alco 
management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by global treasury and our enterprise risk management group 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers 
we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader 
table of contents access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window and term auction facility 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
sources of liquidity come from two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales 
each of these sources of liquidity is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario  in which we would need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
uses of liquidity result from the following withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits  draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  and short duration advance facilities 
customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the customer deposits are payable upon demand or are short term in nature  which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include  among other things  adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs  and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers 
in managing our liquidity  we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit and invested those funds in short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs 
this portfolio stood at billion at december   compared to billion at december  in connection with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs  we have participated in the federal reserve s term auction facility  or taf  which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions 
as of december   state street bank s borrowings under the taf totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  the highest taf balances borrowed by state street bank during and were billion and billion  respectively 
the average borrowings for both years were approximately billion and approximately billion  respectively 
the higher aggregate certificate of deposit and taf balances as of december  were attributable to the impact of the may conduit consolidation 
prior to the consolidation  the conduits funded their asset purchases through the issuance of asset backed commercial paper 
subsequent to the consolidation  state street bank has funded the conduits assets with the aforementioned sources  as well as the issuance of conduit asset backed commercial paper 
as of december   asset backed commercial paper issued to third parties by the conduits totaled approximately billion 
while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly 
as of december   the 
table of contents value of our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  the decrease was mainly attributable to unusually high deposit balances  as we experienced a significant increase in customer deposits during the second half of as the credit markets worsened 
as customers accumulated liquidity  they placed cash with us  and these incremental customer deposits remained with state street bank at december  during  as markets normalized  deposit levels moderated as customers returned to investing their cash  and our liquid asset levels declined accordingly 
due to the unusual size and volatile nature of these customer deposits  we maintained approximately billion at central banks as of december   in excess of regulatory required minimums 
securities carried at billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation  unless pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston 
liquid assets included securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston to secure state street bank s ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise 
this access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window 
based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration  management considers overall liquidity at december  to be sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our customers 
as referenced above  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and customer deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

the measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital 
we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s key risk indicators 
these indicators are designed to identify major business activities of state street with significant risk content  and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement 
key risk indicators are reported regularly to the risk and capital committee of the board and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness 
modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a dedicated corporate group  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits  and with business line management  monitors key risks 
the chief risk officer meets regularly with the board or a board committee  as appropriate  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties in the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is designing  orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between erm and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 

table of contents responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees 
the major risk committee  or mrc  is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies  and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification  analysis  measurement and control of material risks across state street 
chaired by the chief risk officer  the mrc focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives 
our capital committee  chaired by our chief financial officer  oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances 
alco  chaired by the treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions 
the fiduciary review committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers 
the credit committee  chaired within erm  acts as the credit policy committee for state street 
the operational risk committee  chaired by the chief risk officer  provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
the model assessment committee  chaired within erm  provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses 
several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the mrc 
corporate audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management  providing the board and management with continuous monitoring and control audits to assess adherence to state street s policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls 
additionally  the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts 
the corporate compliance  regulatory and industry affairs  and legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management 
corporate compliance is responsible for the design  implementation and oversight of policies  guidelines and programs to support our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business 
the regulatory and industry affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation  and the legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments  maximize business opportunities and minimize legal  regulatory and other risks 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices 
state street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes related to these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
we primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs  customer requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
trading activities market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines  including established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee

in addition  we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets 
our customers use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward and spot contracts 
in the aggregate  long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item as noted above  we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies  including value at risk  or var  which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk measurement system to estimate var daily 
we have adopted standards for estimating var  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
var is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated var more than of the time  or less than three business days out of a year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates domestic and foreign and foreign exchange implied volatilities  and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  var is subject to limitations and assumptions inherent in our methodology 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day 
therefore  implicit in the var estimate is the assumption that no intraday actions are taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not include risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 
the following table presents var with respect to our trading activities  for trading positions held during the periods indicated  as measured by our var methodology 
the generally lower total var amounts compared to component var amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types 
amounts presented for have been restated to conform to current year methodology 
value at risk years ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum foreign exchange rates interest rates total var for trading assets we back test the estimated one day var on a daily basis 
this information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled 
for the years ended december  and  we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day var estimate 

table of contents during  our var measurement methodology was extended to measure var associated with certain assets classified as trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
these assets are not held in connection with typical trading activities  and thus are not reflected in the foregoing var table 
in the table below  the var associated with these investments is reported as var for non trading assets 
total regulatory var is calculated as the sum of the var for trading assets and the var for non trading assets  with no diversification benefits recognized 
the average  maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately

asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco 
our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir  global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units  north america  europe and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivatives is subject to alco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item as a result of growth in our non us operations  non us dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in 
table of contents interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
finally  gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alco established guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests by both global treasury and alco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrower s prepayment opportunity 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely predict future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 

table of contents the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp the more significant nir sensitivity over the next months for an upward bp shock at december  compared to december  was primarily the result of expected purchases of fixed rate investment securities associated with the aforementioned proposed acquisition of intesa sanpaola and the expected addition of fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge long term debt 
nir sensitivity to a downward bp shock became less sensitive at december  compared to december  contributing factors included growth in average noninterest bearing deposits and less responsiveness in non us deposit yields to a downward rate shock 
the year over year changes in nir at risk exposure to upward bp and downward bp ramps were directionally the same as for the shocks  although the change was less pronounced  due to the gradual shift in market rates inherent in the ramp scenarios 
other important factors that impact the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and december   assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions rate change bps shock bps shock the change in eve sensitivity for an upward bp shock at december  compared to december  was mainly attributable to maturities and sales of fixed rate investment securities coupled with our re investment in floating rate investment securities  which reduced overall portfolio duration 
with respect to the change in eve sensitivity for a downward bp shock at december  compared to december   deposit yields and short term market interest rates moved lower during  preventing the effect of the shock from fully occurring  and limiting the benefit of lower rates on the estimated fair value of customer deposits 

table of contents credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms 
we assume credit and counterparty risk on both our on and off balance sheet exposures 
the extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations 
we maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually  while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
at any point in time  having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds of our consolidated total shareholders equity  exclusive of unrealized gains or losses  is not unusual 
exposure to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by erm 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that is intended to enhance customer relationships  increase profitability and manage risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated  and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss 
state street s risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management s judgment 
qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner  and following a formal review and approval process  an internal credit rating based on state street s credit scale is assigned 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio 
information about provisions for loan losses is included in the provision for loan losses section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we purchase securities under agreements to resell 
risk is managed through a variety of processes  including establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases largely to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of transaction assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if we believe that additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
we also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 
on behalf of our customers  we lend their securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion at december   and billion at december  we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
we held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december  and  respectively 

table of contents the collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our customers 
in certain cases  the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements  for which we indemnify the customer against loss of the principal invested 
we require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the amount of the repurchase agreement 
the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
of the collateral of billion at december  and billion at december  referenced above  billion at december  and billion at december  was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 
we held  as agent  billion and billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements at december  and december   respectively 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities  as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  we provide a broad array of services  including research  investment management  trading services and investment servicing  that give rise to operational risk 
consequently  active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which codify our approach to operational risk 
the guidelines document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in a consistent manner across state street 
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
we maintain an operational risk governance structure designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
the risk and capital committee of the board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework 
erm develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program 
business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls  which are designed to provide a sound operational environment 
the business units also identify  manage  and report on operational risk 
the mrc and the operational risk committee review operational risk related information and policies  provide oversight of the operational risk program  and escalate operational risk issues of note to the risk and capital committee 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining and audit committee of the board 
our discipline in managing operational risk  which is a result of this emphasis on policy  guidelines  oversight  and independent review  provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers 
table of contents and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain customers  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of our business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities  referred to as spes 
one type of spe is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles 
since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles under current accounting standards  we do not record these vehicles in our consolidated financial statements 
a second type of spe is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program  under which conduits administered by us sell commercial paper to our institutional customers  primarily mutual fund customers  as short term investments 
in may  as a result of actions we elected to take  we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these conduits under current accounting standards  and were required by these standards to consolidate them into our consolidated financial statements 
a third type of spe is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program  under which partnership trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets to our mutual fund customers 
these trusts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements  since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings  not as sales 
additional information about the activities of the above described spes  including information with respect to the consolidation of the conduits  is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item in the normal course of our business  we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers  and  in accordance with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about these off balance sheet activities is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item in the normal course of our business  we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs  to conduct our trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk
