item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
we generate revenue by developing  manufacturing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices 
our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers  servers  and intelligent devices  server applications for distributed computing environments  information worker productivity applications  business solutions applications  high performance computing applications  software development tools  and video games 
we provide consulting and product and solution support services  and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers 
we also design and sell hardware  including the xbox gaming and entertainment console and accessories  the zune digital music and entertainment device and accessories  and microsoft pc hardware products 
online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through bing  windows live  microsoft office web apps  our msn portals and channels  and to businesses through microsoft online services offerings  such as microsoft dynamics crm online  exchange online  windows azure  sql azure and sharepoint online 
we enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on bing through our proprietary adcenter platform 
our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 
our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season 
typically  the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately of its annual segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter 
in addition  quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue 
see the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to eligible sales of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost the office deferral and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows at minimal or no cost and of windows to original equipment manufacturers and retailers before general availability the windows deferral 
global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software  services  hardware  and online offerings 
the unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year as consumers and businesses cut back on spending  which reduced pc shipments and it investments 
during fiscal year  the environment began to improve 
however  the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain and are likely to remain so into irrespective of global economic conditions  we are positive about our relative market position  our current product portfolio and future product pipeline 
because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs  including cloud based services  we believe that microsoft is well positioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves 
we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses 
technological innovation is the foundation of our long term growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to investment in research and development  engineering excellence  and delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance information worker productivity  improve communication and collaboration in work groups  aid business intelligence  and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses 
to sustain growth in the face of competition from other vendors of proprietary and open source software  our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing software that is easiest to deploy and manage  and that is most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership 

table of contents part ii item in addition  we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business  including cloud computing  search  online solutions  business solutions  mobile computing  communication  entertainment  and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products 
we believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 
this long term focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products  creating opportunities for partners  and improving customer satisfaction 
our focus in fiscal year is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform  by responding effectively to customer and partner needs  and by focusing internally on product excellence  business efficacy  and accountability across the company

net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity  commodity  and interest rate derivatives in fiscal year as compared with gains in the prior period

the fiscal year rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year our effective tax rates in fiscal years and were and  respectively 
while the fiscal year rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service irs settling the examination  partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible 
as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years  we paid the irs approximately billion during fiscal year financial condition cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion as of june   compared with billion as of june  equity and other investments were billion as of june   compared with billion as of june  our short term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation 
they consist predominantly of investment grade fixed income securities  diversified among industries and individual issuers 
the investments are predominantly us dollar denominated securities  but also include foreign currency denominated securities in order to diversify risk 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  such as exchange traded mutual funds  domestic and international equities  and us treasuries 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as corporate notes and bonds  foreign government bonds  mortgage backed securities  and agency securities 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments 
broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available  the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors  or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades 
our broker priced investments are generally labeled as level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments 
in addition  all 
table of contents part ii item of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include model validation  review of key model inputs  analysis of period over period fluctuations  and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 
while we own certain mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the majority of the mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  and government national mortgage association 
we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
debt in september  our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to billion 
as of june   we had billion of issued and outstanding debt comprised of billion of commercial paper and billion of long term debt including billion of convertible debt 
short term debt as of june   our billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate  including issuance costs  of and maturities of to days 
in november  we replaced our billion and billion credit facilities with a billion day credit facility  which expires on november  this facility serves as a back up for our commercial paper program 
in june  we reduced the size of our credit facility from billion to billion due to the reduction in commercial paper outstanding 
as of june   we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement  which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to interest expense 
no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented 
long term debt notes as of june   we had issued and outstanding billion of debt securities as follows billion aggregate principal amount of notes due  billion aggregate principal amount of notes due  and million aggregate principal amount of notes due collectively the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year to holders of record on the preceding may and november the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 
convertible debt in june  we issued billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june  in a private placement offering 
proceeds from the offering were billion  net of fees and expenses which were capitalized 
the majority of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper  leaving billion of commercial paper outstanding as of june  each  principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of per share 

table of contents part ii item prior to march   the notes will be convertible  only in certain circumstances  into cash and  if applicable  cash  shares of microsoft s common stock or a combination thereof  at our election 
on or after march   the notes will be convertible at any time 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election 
because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash  we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
the net proceeds of billion were allocated between debt for billion and stockholders equity for million  with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates 
the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes 
under the capped call transactions  we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes  with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price initially equal to 
the purchased capped calls were valued at million and were charged to stockholders equity

unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period 
unearned revenue at june  also included payments for post delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future  xbox live subscriptions  unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis for windows xp  microsoft dynamics business solutions products  technology guarantee programs  including the microsoft office technology guarantee program  and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software  or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 
the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june  in millions three months ending  september  december  march  june  thereafter total cash flows fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flow from operations increased billion  primarily due to payment of billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year

in evaluating 
table of contents part ii item estimated losses on these indemnifications  we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements

recent legislation in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the united states 
this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured 
the changes required by this legislation will largely be funded through tax increases to both insurers and the insured 
we do not expect any near term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation 
one provision that will impact certain companies significantly is the elimination of the tax deductibility of the medicare part d subsidy 
this provision does not affect us because we do not provide retiree health benefits 
recently issued accounting standards recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning january   except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level fair value measurements  which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on july   we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations 
the guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations 
it also requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
we have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since july  on july   we adopted guidance issued by the fasb that changes the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests 
non controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to a non controlling interest is to be included in net income and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on july   we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning july  under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope 
table of contents part ii item of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for us beginning july  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  goodwill  research and development costs  contingencies  income taxes  stock based compensation  and product warranties 
revenue recognition software revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method  and the deferred revenue is recognized as the elements are delivered 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis 
revenue related to windows vista and windows is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements 
microsoft office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the microsoft office system technology guarantee program  which started march  this program allows customers who purchased certain versions of the microsoft office system to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost when the product becomes generally available 
accordingly  estimated revenue related to the undelivered microsoft office system is deferred until the product is delivered 
impairment of investment securities investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 

table of contents part ii item we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
in addition to the impairment test performed on may   we performed an interim impairment analysis of our online services division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year in connection with the disposal of razorfish 
no impairment of goodwill was identified 
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
generally  this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax 
table of contents part ii item position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
product warranties we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
for hardware warranty  we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates  historical and projected repair costs  and knowledge of specific product failures if any 
the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business  but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from days to three years 
for software warranty  we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes  such as security patches  over the life of the software 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 

table of contents part ii item statement of management s responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report 
the consolidated financial statements  which include amounts based on management s estimates and judgments  have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition  and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets

quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  equity prices  and commodity prices 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency 
certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
interest rate 
our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices 
in addition  we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities 
equity 
our equity portfolio consists of global  developed  and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk 
we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
commodity 
we use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification 
our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities  including precious metals  energy  and grain 
we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
value at risk we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and commodity prices  assuming normal market conditions 
the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  and legal risk 
the following table sets forth the one day var for substantially all of our positions as of june  and and for the year ended june  in millions june  june  year ended june  risk categories average high low foreign currency interest rate equity commodity total one day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june   and less at june   than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks
