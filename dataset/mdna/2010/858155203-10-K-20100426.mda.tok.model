north america segment our north america segment serves customers in the united states us and canada 
our portfolio of integrated architecture  furniture and technology products is marketed to corporate  government  healthcare  education and retail customers through the steelcase  turnstone  details and nurture by steelcase brands 
we serve north america customers mainly through approximately independent and company owned dealers and we also sell directly to end use customers 
our end use customers are distributed across a broad range of industries and vertical markets including healthcare  government  financial services  higher education and technology  but no industry or vertical market individually represented more than of the north america segment revenue in the healthcare  government and higher education vertical markets collectively represented approximately of north america revenue 
these vertical markets experienced lower declines in than other vertical markets 
in addition  the revenue decline in the financial services vertical market was lower than average in  as this vertical market entered the downturn earlier than other markets and experienced a significant decline in each of our dealers maintains its own sales force  which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with our dealers throughout the selling process 
the largest independent dealer in north america accounted for approximately of the segment s revenue in and the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of the segment s revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
from time to time  we extend financial support to our dealers 
the type of involvement varies  but it most often takes the form of asset backed lending or term notes to facilitate the transition of a dealership to owners suitable to us 
depending on the situation  accounting rules may require us to consolidate a dealer for a period of time when we extend such financing 
in  the north america segment recorded revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately  related to manufacturing 
the north america office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products 
the industry competes on a combination of insight  product performance  design  price and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most significant competitors in the us are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc 
and knoll  inc together with steelcase  these companies represent more than one half of the us office furniture industry by revenue 

table of contents international segment our international segment serves customers outside of the us and canada primarily under the steelcase brand  with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems  storage and seating solutions 
the international office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in many cases  these competitors focus on specific product categories 
our largest presence is in western europe  where we have the leading market share in germany  france and spain 
in  approximately of international revenue was from western europe 
the remaining revenue was from northern  central  eastern and southern europe  latin america  asia pacific  the middle east and africa

in  polyvision exited the final portion of the public bid contractor whiteboard fabrication business in the us polyvision previously manufactured and sold corporate whiteboard and certain other corporate technology products which were transferred to the steelcase brand in the north america segment during polyvision s sales of visual communication products are primarily through audio visual resellers and our north america dealer network 
ideo is an innovation and design firm that uses a human centered  design based approach to generate new offerings and build new capabilities for its customers 
ideo serves steelcase and a variety of other organizations within consumer products  financial services  healthcare  information technology  government  transportation and other industries 
we have a collaborative relationship with ideo which generates innovative solutions and customer experience insights 
in  we entered into an agreement which will allow certain members of the management of ideo to purchase a controlling equity interest in ideo in two phases by the agreement allows us to retain a minimum equity interest in ideo  and we expect to continue our collaborative relationship with ideo during and after this ownership transition 
as of february   ideo management effectively purchased of ideo under the first phase of the agreement 
phase two of the agreement began in and allows ideo management to purchase an additional equity interest to be completed by the end of phase two also includes a variable compensation program that may provide ideo management with a portion of the funding for the remaining purchase

unallocated corporate expenses are reported as corporate 
joint ventures and other equity investments we enter into joint ventures and other equity investments from time to time to expand or maintain our geographic presence  support our distribution network or invest in complementary products and services 
as of february   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments was our portion of the income or loss from joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for of our consolidated revenue in  and our five largest direct sale customers collectively accounted for of our consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies 
in aggregate  entities purchasing under our us general services administration contract collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
working capital our accounts receivable are from our dealers and direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america segment  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment from dealers by offering an early settlement discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within two to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics we have manufacturing operations throughout north america  europe principally in france  germany and spain and in asia principally in china and malaysia 

table of contents we have evolved our manufacturing and supply chain systems significantly over the past several years by implementing lean manufacturing principles 
in particular  we have focused on implementing continuous one piece flow  platforming our processes and product offerings  and developing a global network of integrated suppliers 
any operation which cannot be part of one piece flow may be evaluated to see whether outside partners would offer better levels of service  quality and cost 
our global manufacturing operations are centralized under a single organization to serve our customers needs across multiple brands and geographies 
this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  inventory levels and the footprint of our manufacturing space  while at the same time  allowing us to improve quality  delivery performance and the customer experience 
we continue to identify opportunities to further reduce excess capacity and redundancy while remaining focused on our growth strategies 
in  we completed a series of actions to consolidate our manufacturing facilities globally 
in  we have initiated a formal procedure of discussions with local work councils regarding a project to reorganize our european manufacturing operations 
in addition to our ongoing focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort 
we have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe 
this global view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources  and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements from all levels throughout the supply chain 
our physical distribution system utilizes dedicated fleet  commercial transport and company owned delivery services 
over the past several years  we have implemented a network of regional distribution centers to reduce freight costs and improve service to our dealers and customers 
some of these distribution centers are located within our manufacturing facilities  and we have engaged third party logistics providers to operate most of these regional distribution centers 
raw materials and energy prices we source raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world 
those raw materials include steel and other metals  plastics  fabrics  wood  paint and other materials and components 
to date  we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining these raw materials 
the prices for certain commodities such as steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions  the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of cost  quality and reliability of supply 
research  design and development our extensive global research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated analysis has helped us develop social  spatial and informational insights into work effectiveness 
we maintain collaborative relationships with external world class innovators  including leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders  to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe 
our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions vary from furniture  architecture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare  higher education and professional services 
organizationally  global design leadership directs strategy and project work  which is distributed to design studios across our major businesses and often involves external design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features 
table of contents with efficient manufacturing practices 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we invested  and in research  design and development activities in  and  respectively 
in  research  design and development spending was down due to benefits from cost reduction efforts  lower variable compensation expense and temporary reductions in employee salaries and retirement benefits 
we continue to invest approximately one to two percent of our revenue in research  design and development each year 
royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold 
these costs are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable  based on product sales 
intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business 
we also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the steelcase  turnstone  coalesse  ideo  polyvision  designtex  details and nurture by steelcase trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
employees as of february   we had approximately  employees  including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  we had approximately temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
approximately employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
internationally  approximately  employees are represented by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management promotes positive relations with employees based on empowerment and teamwork 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
we are a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties  we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these 
table of contents properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about currently  or that we currently believe are less significant  may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our industry is influenced significantly by cyclical macroeconomic factors 
our revenues come predominantly from the office furniture industry  and demand for office furniture is influenced heavily by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  white collar employment and commercial office construction and vacancy rates 
during the past ten years  the us office furniture industry has gone through two major downturns  with consumption declining by more than from calendar year to and again from to  according to the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association 
during these downturns  our profitability has been significantly reduced 
if the magnitude and frequency of cyclical downturns continues and we are not successful in adapting our business model  our profitability could be further impacted in the future 
the current global recession may have a prolonged adverse effect on our business 
our revenues have declined significantly since the beginning of the current global recession  from billion in to billion in this decline has had a negative effect on our profitability  as well as the profitability of our dealers 
historically  the office furniture industry has lagged in recovery from an overall economic recovery by two to three quarters  however  due to the global financial crisis underlying this recession  it is possible that business capital spending and employment growth  coming out of this downturn  may be slower than typical  which would extend the recovery timeline for our industry and our company 
if the recovery from this recession is prolonged  our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted 
in such circumstances  we may take further action to restructure our business  which would result in additional restructuring costs  and we may delay progress on our growth 
table of contents initiatives 
in addition  the profitability and liquidity of our dealers  suppliers and customers could continue to be negatively impacted  which may result in increased provisions for credit losses  manufacturing delays and lower demand for our products 
failure to respond to workplace trends may adversely affect our revenue and profits 
changes in technology and the nature and location of work can have a significant impact on the demand for office furniture  the types of products purchased and the geographic location of the demand 
for example  in recent years  workplace trends  driven largely by technology and the mobility of workers  have included a reduction in the amount of office floor space allocated per employee  a reduction in size and price of a typical workstation and an increase in telecommuting and work space hoteling 
if we are unsuccessful in developing and offering products which respond to changes in the workplace  or if we fail to adapt our business to the geographic changes in where work is performed  our revenue and profits may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategies 
we believe our future success depends on our ability to successfully implement and manage growth strategies that will preserve our position as the world s largest office furniture manufacturer  as well as expand our offerings into adjacent and emerging markets 
in particular  our strategies include protecting and expanding our success in existing markets  by migrating existing customers to newer products and attracting new customers  continuing our expansion into adjacent markets such as the mid market segment smaller white collar worker firms  healthcare clinical spaces and classrooms and in between spaces in the education market  growing our market share in emerging markets such as china  india and the middle east  investing in acquisitions and new business ventures  and developing new alliances and additional channels of distribution 
if we do not implement our strategies successfully  or if our strategies are not sufficient to diversify and expand our revenue stream  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our continuing efforts to restructure our business will result in additional restructuring costs and may result in customer disruption 
over the past decade  we have implemented significant restructuring actions at an aggregate cost of more than the focus of these actions has been on reinventing our industrial system through implementation of lean manufacturing principles  manufacturing facility consolidation and simplifying our product portfolio  and on reducing our operating expenses through white collar workforce reductions  applying lean in the office principles  reinventing work processes and opening shared services centers in malaysia and mexico 
since  we have reduced our manufacturing footprint measured in square footage globally by more than  and our total number of employees globally has declined from  to  we continue to evolve and optimize our business model to be flexible and agile in meeting changing demand  and additional restructuring actions may be necessary as we continue to evolve our cost structure 
the success of our restructuring initiatives is dependent on several factors  including our ability to manage these actions without disrupting existing customer commitments 
further  these actions may not be accomplished as quickly or effectively as anticipated and may distract management from other activities  and we may not realize the benefits of our restructuring activities  either of which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents our investments in company owned life insurance may continue to have a material effect on our earnings 
we have invested in company owned life insurance policies as a long term funding source for certain employee post retirement medical benefit  deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plan obligations 
as of february   the cash surrender value of these investments was on our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of these policies are variable life insurance policies which are invested  at our direction  in equity and fixed income investments 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies can increase or decline significantly based on volatility in the capital markets  which in turn can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
during  declines in the investments within our variable life insurance policies resulted in a non tax deductible loss of  and during  we recorded non taxable income of from these policies 
our global presence subjects us to risks that may negatively affect our profitability and financial condition 
we have manufacturing facilities and sales  administrative and shared services offices in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our global presence is subject to risks that may limit our ability to design  develop  manufacture  or sell products in particular countries  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including political  social and economic instability  intellectual property protection challenges  differing employment practices and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our global business standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  including regulations governing trade between countries  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  natural disasters  security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest and global health issues  and fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange and currency controls 
we may be adversely affected by changes in raw material and commodity costs 
we procure raw materials from a significant number of sources globally 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the cost of petroleum based products  steel  wood  particleboard  aluminum  copper and other commodities  such as fuel and energy  has fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
these changes can also lead to supply interruptions 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs continue to fluctuate 
in the short term  rapid changes in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of contractual agreements we have entered into with our customers and are difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against 
also  if we are not successful in passing along higher raw material costs to our customers  because of competitive pressures  our profitability could be negatively impacted 

table of contents disruptions to the supply of raw materials  component parts and labor in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our supply chain management 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials and components from third party suppliers and labor in our own manufacturing operations 
the flow of such materials and components may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of the raw materials  disruptions caused by labor activities  the financial solvency of our suppliers  and damage and loss or disruption of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes 
our migration to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model has increased our reliance on a global network of suppliers 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of component parts and products or deficiencies in our ability to develop and manage our network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
we rely largely on a network of over independent and company owned dealers to market  deliver and install our products to customers 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers 
we have relatively low turnover of dealers in a typical year 
from time to time  we or a dealer may choose to terminate our relationship  or the dealer could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
in addition  our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert a number of our dealers to carry their products 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership which would reduce the risk of disruption but increase our financial exposure 
establishing new dealers in a market can take considerable time and resources 
a portion of our distribution network is company owned because of the need for us to make financial investments in dealerships in order to preserve our market share and profitability in the affected regions 
in certain markets  with certain customers and  to a limited extent  in the retail sales segment  we have adopted a direct model of distribution through which we establish company owned sales and service capabilities 
our direct sale and owned dealer models sell non steelcase products where product gaps exist 
if we are not able to effectively manage these businesses  they could have a negative effect on our operating results 
we may be adversely impacted by product defects 
product defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our increasing reliance on third parties for product development  manufacturing and testing activities 
we incur various expenses related to product defects  including product warranty costs  product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs  which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls 
we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions  but our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve  
table of contents resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges 
we purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets which would adversely affect our results of operations 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
poor performance in portions of our business where we have goodwill or intangible assets  or declines in the market value of our equity  may result in impairment charges  which would adversely affect our profitability 
during and  we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments of and  respectively 
no goodwill or intangible asset impairments were recorded in we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units primarily using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of various factors 
in addition  estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the weighted average costs of capital 
changes in these forecasts and estimates could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
our cost of borrowing may increase which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected by market conditions and credit ratings assigned to our long term debt by the major credit rating agencies 
these ratings are based  in significant part  on our financial performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios  as well our business risk profile  which captures factors such as brand strength  scale and diversification of revenues 
as of february   our long term debt ratings are bbb on creditwatch from standard poor s and ba with a negative outlook from moody s investor service 
although our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances  cash generated from future operations  funds available from coli and funds available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable needs  a prolonged or further decline in demand could impact our financial performance and associated credit metrics which could lead to downgrades of our credit ratings 
any such downgrade may increase our cost of borrowing or limit our access to the capital markets  either of which could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a ratings downgrade could also cause us to contemplate changes in our liquidity position and capital structure  including the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments or the structure and level of debt that we maintain 
there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
we have deferred tax asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling which reside primarily in various non us jurisdictions and reflect a valuation allowance 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction or implement tax  business or other planning strategies to fully utilize the estimated value of our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk  which could reduce the amount we may ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  price  lead time  delivery and service  insight from our research  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
the competitors that we face  our market share and our competitiveness on the factors stated above can vary significantly by geographic location within the us and internationally

liquidity and capital resources liquidity as a result of a decline in the level of business activity since  we currently target to maintain approximately in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to fund the day to day operations of our business  to provide available liquidity for funding investments in growth initiatives and as a cushion against volatility in the economy 
our actual cash and short term investment balances will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we plan for and manage certain seasonal disbursements  particularly the annual payment of accrued variable compensation and retirement plan contributions in q of each fiscal year  when applicable

as a result of this change  we may adjust the target asset allocation of the investments in the variable life coli policies 
we continue our intention to utilize our whole life coli policies as the funding source for post retirement medical benefits and other employee obligations 
we believe the whole life coli policies  which are with highly rated insurance companies  represent a stable source for these long term benefit obligations 
this change does not result in our investments in coli representing a committed funding source for liquidity or long term employee benefit obligations 
they are subject to claims from creditors  and we can designate them to another purpose at any time 
this change will have no impact on the financial statement classification of the net returns in cash surrender value  normal insurance expenses and any death benefit gains related to our investments in whole life coli policies  which is currently allocated between cost of sales and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the costs associated with the long term employee benefit obligations that the investments in whole life policies are intended to fund

the loan has a term of seven years and requires fixed monthly principal payments of based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due in q the loan is secured by our two corporate aircraft  contains no financial covenants and is not cross defaulted to our other debt facilities 
our long term debt ratings are bbb on creditwatch from standard poor s and ba with a negative outlook from moody s investor service as of february  these ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt or an increase in the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities 
liquidity outlook our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances  cash generated from future operations  funds available from coli and funds available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity needs 
the deterioration in the global economy has adversely impacted our revenue and operating profitability 
accordingly  we have taken a variety of actions to improve our operating efficiencies and to conserve cash and maintain liquidity 
in  we completed a number of restructuring activities to consolidate manufacturing facilities and reduce our global workforce and other operating costs 
in  we have initiated a formal procedure of discussions with local work councils regarding a project to reorganize our european manufacturing operations 
we implemented a temporary reduction in employee salaries and we did not make any contributions to the steelcase inc retirement plan for the wage reductions for salaried employees were reinstated as of the beginning of we reduced the cash dividend on our common stock and the level of share repurchases in we reduced our level of capital expenditures in to approximately  as compared to for  which included of progress payments associated with replacement corporate aircraft 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately  including for progress payments associated with a replacement corporate aircraft 
we replaced our global credit facility on december  under modified terms that provide us greater access to borrowings during economic downturns 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and 
table of contents actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting estimates that typically involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are listed and explained below 
these estimates were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually in q  or earlier if conditions indicate it is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets using seven reporting units where goodwill is recorded specifically  north america  europe and asia pacific within the international segment  and coalesse  designtex  polyvision and ideo within the other category 
annually in q  or earlier if conditions indicate it is necessary  we perform an impairment analysis of our intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
we also perform an impairment analysis of our intangible assets subject to amortization during interim periods upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstance 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determine if the asset is recoverable and then compare the discounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
as of february   we had of goodwill and of net intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as follows other intangible reportable segment goodwill assets  net north america international other category total during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units 
in the first step to test for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation dcf method and reconciled the fair value of our reporting units to the sum of our total market capitalization plus a control premium our adjusted market capitalization 
the control premium represents an estimate associated with obtaining control of the company in an acquisition of the outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock 
the dcf analysis used the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows in measuring fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment valuations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with our current internal projections 
as part of the reconciliation to our adjusted market capitalization  we made adjustments to the estimated future cash flows  as well as the discount rates used in calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
the discount rates ranged from to 
due to the subjective nature of this reconciliation process  these assumptions could change over time  which may result in future impairment charges 

table of contents as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category for each reporting unit  the excess enterprise value available for goodwill is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate by  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the enterprise value in excess of goodwill to the following amounts enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category based on the sensitivity analysis above  the asia pacific  coalesse and designtex reporting units would have had goodwill balances in excess of enterprise value available for goodwill and would have triggered the second step of our impairment testing 
these reporting units had recorded goodwill aggregating  and  respectively as of february  see note and to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
we are audited by the us internal revenue service under the compliance assurance process cap 
under cap  the u 
s internal revenue service works with large business taxpayers to identify and resolve issues prior to the filing of a tax return 
accordingly  we expect to record minimal liabilities for us federal uncertain tax positions in future years 
tax positions are reviewed regularly for state  local and non us tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
our liability for uncertain tax positions in these jurisdictions is deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all positive and negative evidence 
these assumptions require significant judgment about forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the internal plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
future tax benefits of tax losses and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
as of february   we estimate a potential tax benefit from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowances of  but we have recorded a valuation allowance of  which reduced our realized tax benefit to additionally  
table of contents we realized a tax benefit from tax credit carryforwards of it is considered more likely than not that a combined benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards in future periods 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would have resulted in a decrease in net income for of approximately changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
in march  the us enacted significant healthcare reform legislation which effectively changes the tax treatment of the federal subsidies received by employers who provide certain prescription drug benefits for retirees the medicare part d subsidy beginning after december  we are required to recognize the impact of the tax law change in the period in which the law is enacted 
in q  we expect to recognize a reduction in deferred tax assets related to the medicare part d subsidy with an offsetting increase in income tax expense of approximately we are not aware of any other such tax law or rate changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
pension and other post retirement benefits the company sponsors a number of domestic and foreign plans to provide pension  medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
as of february  and february   the projected benefit obligation  fair value of plan assets and funded status of these plans are as follows defined benefit post retirement pension plans plans february  february  february  february  projected benefit plan obligations fair value of plan assets funded status the post retirement medical and life insurance plans are unfunded  but we purchased coli policies with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for benefit obligations 
the asset values of the coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plans  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the post retirement benefits expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
as of february   approximately of our defined benefit pension obligations related to our non qualified supplemental retirement plans that are limited to a select group of management approved by the compensation committee 
these plans are unfunded  but we purchased coli policies with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for benefit obligations 
the asset values of the coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plans  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the defined benefit pension expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working lives 
inherent in this approach is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
key actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include  among others  the discount rate and health cost trend rates 
these assumptions are reviewed with our actuaries and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including  but not limited to  benefit payments  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 

table of contents to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we perform a matching exercise of projected plan cash flows against spot rates on a yield curve comprised of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date ryan alm curve with a primary focus for our domestic plans 
the measurement dates for our retiree benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices at the end of each year 
based on consolidated obligations as of february   a one percentage point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would have changed the benefits expense by approximately and changed the consolidated obligations by approximately all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
to conduct our annual review of healthcare cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial healthcare cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
as of february   our initial rates of for pre age retirees and for post age retirees were trended downward by each year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate healthcare cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations as of february   a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have changed the benefits expense by less than and changed the consolidated obligations by approximately all experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method  over at least the minimum amortization prescribed by accounting guidance 
despite the previously described policies for selecting key actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of february   we had consolidated unamortized prior service credits and net experience gains of  as compared to as of february  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on employee benefit obligations 
forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations 
these forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  possible  potential  predict  project  or other similar words  phrases or expressions 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations because of factors such as  but not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions domestically and internationally  acts of terrorism  war  governmental action  natural disasters and other force majeure events  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  our restructuring activities  currency fluctuations  changes in customer demand  and the other risks and contingencies detailed in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from foreign currency exchange  interest rates  commodity prices and fixed income and equity prices  which could affect our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily on sales commitments  anticipated sales and purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we transact business in primary currencies worldwide  of which the most significant in were the euro  the canadian dollar and the pound sterling 
revenue from foreign locations represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and in we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
our results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
in the united kingdom  our results continue to be negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts of the weak pound sterling  relative to the euro  as the products we sell in the united kingdom are primarily manufactured within the euro zone 
we estimate that an additional devaluation of the us dollar against local currencies would not have had a material impact on our operating income in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the fiscal year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  we could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  net transaction losses were not material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our short and long term investments and short and long term borrowings 
our short term investments are primarily invested in us treasury  us government agency and corporate debt instruments 
additionally we held and canadian par value investments in ars and canadian abcprn  respectively  as of february   which are classified as long term investments as no liquid markets currently exist for these securities 
the risk on our short and long term borrowings primarily relates to a loan  which bears a floating interest rate based on day libor plus 
we estimate a increase in interest rates would have reduced our results of operations by approximately in see note and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk primarily on our raw materials inventory 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the cost of petroleum based products  steel  wood  particleboard  aluminum  copper and other commodities  such as fuel and energy  has fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs continue to fluctuate 
we actively manage these raw materials costs through global sourcing initiatives and price increases on our products 
however  in the short term  rapid increases in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of contractual agreements we have entered into with our customers and competitive pressures 
as a result of changes in commodity costs  cost of sales decreased approximately during we estimate that a increase in commodity prices would have decreased our operating income by approximately in fixed income and equity price risk we are exposed to fixed income and equity price risk primarily on the cash surrender value associated with our investments in variable life coli policies and our managed investment portfolio 
we estimate a adverse change in the value of the underlying funds  which could be caused by changes in interest rates  yield curve  portfolio duration or equity prices  would have reduced our operating income by approximately in this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  our investment manager actively manages certain fixed income investments and our results could be better or worse than market returns
