item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass seven segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the us retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities  retirement and asset management segments 
the us individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
our corporate and other operations include our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested  including our investment in the wachovia securities joint venture which we sold on december   and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which are reflected in corporate and other operations 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 

table of contents we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
at the time of demutualization  we determined the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
the closed block business is not a separate legal entity from the financial services businesses  however  they are operated as separate entities and are separated for financial reporting purposes 
the financial services businesses are not obligated to pay dividends on closed block policies 
dividends on closed block policies reflect the experience of the closed block over time and are subject to adjustment by prudential insurance s board of directors 
further  our plan of demutualization provides that we are not required to pay dividends on policies within the closed block from assets that are not within the closed block and that the establishment of the closed block does not represent a guarantee that any certain level of dividends will be maintained 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 

table of contents profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our ability to manage and control our operating expenses  including overhead expenses  our returns on invested assets  including the impact of credit losses  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  our credit and financial strength ratings  our ability to effectively utilize our tax capacity  our returns on proprietary investments we make  and our ability to manage risk and exposures  including the degree to which  and the effectiveness of  hedging these risks and exposures 
in addition  factors such as credit and real estate market conditions  regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  market fluctuations and general economic  market and political conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
see risk factors for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
executive summary prudential financial  a financial services leader with approximately billion of assets under management as of december   has operations in the united states  asia  europe and latin america 

table of contents through our subsidiaries and affiliates  we offer a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  annuities  retirement related services  mutual funds  investment management  and real estate services 
we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
current developments the global financial markets have shown marked improvement after experiencing extreme stress since the second half of through the early portion of during this period  volatility and disruption in the global financial markets reached unprecedented levels for the post world war ii period and the availability and cost of credit was materially affected 
these factors  combined with recent economic conditions  including depressed home and commercial real estate prices and increasing foreclosures  depressed equity market values  declining business and consumer confidence  and rising unemployment  resulted in a severe economic recession 
certain markets have shown marked improvement since mid equity markets have appreciated  with less volatility  and bond spreads have tightened significantly 
we took advantage of the improving market conditions  and raised approximately billion in the capital markets during through the following issued million shares of prudential financial common stock in a public offering at a price of per share for net proceeds of billion 
issued billion of prudential financial medium term notes 
in january  we issued an additional billion of prudential financial medium term notes 
issued million of prudential insurance surplus notes  exchangeable for prudential financial common stock 
on december   we received billion of proceeds in cash from wells fargo upon the completion of the sale of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities 
in addition  we received million in payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million that had been issued by wachovia securities in connection with the establishment of the joint venture 
as the dislocation in the markets continued  we took certain other actions during to strengthen our liquidity and capital position  including the following made capital contributions and capital loans to our international insurance operations in japan totaling million 
borrowed billion in the form of collateralized funding agreements from the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny  which was subsequently used to replace inter company funding agreements between prudential insurance and prudential financial  previously funded through proceeds from the sale of prudential financial s retail medium term notes  making the corresponding proceeds available for general corporate purposes 
reduced exposure to short term financing markets  primarily through reduction in commercial paper borrowings 
undertook sales of assets held by some of our affiliates to reduce their borrowing needs 
while the above actions have strengthened our liquidity and capital position  certain of them  as well as our decision to maintain higher levels of cash and short term investments than in prior periods  have had a negative impact on current earnings 
for additional information on our liquidity and capital resources  and the actions we undertook in  see liquidity and capital resources 
we continue to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
if the recent improvements in the capital markets prove temporary and earlier disruptions in the capital markets were to resume  we may take additional capital management actions to maintain capital consistent with our rating objectives  which may include additional internal actions or  if internal resources are insufficient or market conditions deteriorate  further access to external sources of capital  if available 

table of contents during  rating agencies downgraded certain ratings of prudential financial and its subsidiaries 
downgrades in our claims paying or credit ratings could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors  distributors  or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability  liquidity and or capital

outlook management expects that the recovery of the economy and global markets will remain challenging in but that results will reflect the quality of our individual businesses and their prospects  as well as our overall business mix 
in  we continue to focus on long term strategic positioning and growth opportunities  including the following us retirement and investment management market 
we look to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods 
in addition  we continue to focus on our clients increasing needs for retirement income security given the recent volatility in the financial markets 
we also look to provide products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and stretch their benefit dollars 

table of contents us insurance market 
we continue to focus on writing high quality business and expect to continue to benefit from expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third party distributors 
we also look to capitalize on opportunities for additional optional life purchases in the group insurance market  as institutional clients are focused on stretching their benefit dollars 
international markets 
we continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate  such as japan  and expanding our distribution channels 
we look to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and public policy have resulted in a growing demand for retirement income products similar to those offered in the us results of operations we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance

included in the increase was a favorable variance of  million related to adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  largely reflecting improved financial market conditions in the increase also included a million favorable variance related to the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features  including changes in our market perceived non performance risk 
this variance resulted in a corresponding million increase in the amortization 
table of contents of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
these favorable variances were partially offset by mark to market losses of million in related to derivative positions associated with our capital hedging program  which we began in the second quarter of results were also favorably impacted by an increase in investment results  driven by higher average annuity account values in investments backed by our general account  partially offset by a decrease in fee income  due to transfers of separate account funds to fixed income investments backed by our general account relating to our automatic rebalancing element

a lower benefit from reserve refinements  primarily related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business  and a decline in asset based fees in our full service business were partial offsets 
asset management segment results declined in largely due to unfavorable results from the segment s commercial mortgage activities reflecting higher credit and valuation related charges on interim loans  as well as lower transaction and performance based incentive fees  and asset management fees 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in losses from the segment s proprietary investing activities 
individual life segment results for improved from  primarily reflecting lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  to reflect the impact of changes to the estimate of total gross profits primarily due to favorable variable product separate account fund performance in and unfavorable performance in  as well as a lower than expected level of death claim costs in results for both periods also benefited from reductions in amortization of net deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves reflecting updates of our actuarial assumptions based on annual reviews 
the benefit in was million  which included an increase in reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature in certain contracts 
the comparable benefit for was million 
results for both periods also benefited from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  which benefited the current year million and the prior year million 
group insurance segment results declined in  reflecting the prior year benefits of a premium adjustment for updated data on a large case and annual reserve refinements 
excluding these benefits in the prior year  the segment results for improved from  primarily reflecting growth in both our group life and group disability businesses

results from the segment s gibraltar life operation were unchanged from to results in include million of earnings from the acquired former business of yamato life 
the earnings from the acquired business include approximately million largely related to initial surrenders of policies following the restructuring of the business  essentially consistent with our overall expectations 
results for for the gibraltar life operations also reflect higher general and administrative expenses including costs of an ongoing technology improvement program 
international investments segment results for improved from primarily due to impairment charges of million in related to operating joint ventures and goodwill  partially offset by less favorable results from the segment s global commodities group 
corporate and other operations resulted in an increased loss for as compared to primarily due to lower investment income  net of interest expense  reflecting the initial investment of debt issuance proceeds in cash and short term investments  as well as increased interest expense on capital debt 
in addition  results reflect a higher level of expenses 
the inclusion of a charge in for goodwill impairment of million associated with our real estate and relocation services business was a partial offset

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes in the closed block business decreased million in compared to  primarily reflecting net realized investment losses in  compared to gains in  as well as a decrease in net investment income  which were partially offset by a decrease in dividends to policyholders  including the decrease in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense 
accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs primarily include commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses that are incurred in producing new business 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as described in more detail below  in calculating dac amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns  mortality and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums 
as of december   dac in our financial services businesses was billion and dac in our closed block business was million 
dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
we also ensure the recoverability of the dac balance at the end of each reporting period 
many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders 
in recent years  dac adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since the closed block had recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  as of december   actual cumulative earnings are below expected cumulative earnings by million  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense 
without the benefit of the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation  changes in gross margins and dac amortization could result in greater volatility in our results of operations 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the non participating whole life  term life  endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the 
table of contents dac balance  we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant deterioration in future experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related dac 
dac associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments is amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the cost of contract minimum guarantees net of  where applicable  the impact of our own risk of non performance and certain hedging activities related to these guarantees 
the impact of our capital hedging program  which we began in the second quarter of  is not considered in calculating gross profits 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
adjustments to the dac balance include our quarterly adjustments for current period experience and market performance related adjustments  as discussed below  and the impact of the annual reviews of our estimate of total gross profits 
we also perform recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure the dac balance does not exceed the present value of estimated gross profits 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period 
total estimated gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change 
in these cases  we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods costs  referred to as an adjustment for current period experience 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience 
we review and update our mortality assumptions annually 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
for the variable and universal life policies in our international insurance segment  mortality assumptions impact to a lesser extent our estimates of future gross profits due to differences in policyholder demographics  the overall age of this block of business  the amount of mortality margins and our actual mortality experience 
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future mortality assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the dac balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  future rate of return  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac  and does not reflect changes in reserves  such as the unearned revenue reserve  which would partially offset the adjustments to the dac balance reflected below 
december  increase reduction in dac in millions decrease in future mortality by increase in future mortality by for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december   and  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual life and group insurance division individual life 
for variable annuity contracts  dac is more sensitive to the effects of changes in our estimates of gross profits due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return 
table of contents on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
this is also true  to a lesser degree  for our variable life policies 
returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances  which increase the fees we earn and decrease the costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts  resulting in higher expected future gross profits and lower dac amortization for the period 
the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations 
the near term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the projected future rate of return over the four year period is greater than our maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum future rate of return 
as of december   our long term expected rates of return across all asset types for variable annuities products and variable life policies range from to per annum  depending on the specific block of business  and reflect  among other assumptions  an expected rate of return of per annum for equity type assets 
unless there is a sustained interim deviation  our long term expected rate of return assumptions generally are not impacted by short term market fluctuations 
as of december   our near term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach for variable annuities products and variable life policies was and per annum  respectively 
included in this blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a per annum maximum rate of return on equity investments 
in the fourth quarter of we determined that adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and any corresponding changes to the projected future rate of return assumptions for our variable annuity contracts should no longer be dependent on a comparison to a statistically generated range of estimated gross profits 
instead  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the projected future rate of return and our estimate of total gross profits are updated each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach 
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization  reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods gross profits 
the new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
for variable annuities products and variable life policies  as of december   our expected rate of return for the next four years across all asset types is and per annum  respectively 
these rates represent a weighted average of our expected rates of return across all contract groups 
for most contract groups  our expected rate of return for the next four years equals our current maximum future rates of return  as the near term projected future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach is greater than our maximum future rate of return 
for certain contract groups relating to variable annuities issued in  the expected rate of return over the next four years is under per annum  reflecting the impact of more favorable markets in and the reversion to the mean approach 
the dac balance associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts was billion as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to the dac balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on the dac balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac 
further  this information does not reflect changes in reserves  such as the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of our variable annuity products  or the impact that changes in such reserves may have on the dac balance

deferred sales inducements and valuation of business acquired in addition to dac  we also recognize assets for deferred sales inducements and valuation of business acquired  or voba 
the deferred sales inducements are recognized primarily in our individual annuities segment and are amortized over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs 
for additional information about our deferred sales inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired businesses  and is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition 
we have established a voba asset primarily for our acquired traditional life  deferred annuity  defined contribution and defined benefit businesses 
voba is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts 
for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred sales inducements and voba are also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the capitalized amounts do not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits 
based on this recoverability testing  in we impaired the entire remaining voba asset related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
for additional information regarding this charge  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not 
the test is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments 
reporting units that had goodwill subject to testing as of december  were the asset management segment  the international insurance segment s life planners business and the retirement segment s full service business 
as required by accounting guidance  the impairment testing process consists of two steps 
step requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be calculated and compared to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value  it is concluded there is no impairment and the analysis is complete 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step of the process is completed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
step utilizes business combination purchase accounting guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill  but including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to the reporting unit s total fair value as calculated in step the excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the fair value of reporting units calculated in step was determined using either an earnings multiple approach or a discounted cash flow approach 
the earnings multiple approach was the primary approach for the asset management and international insurance reporting units  the discounted cash flow approach was primarily utilized by the retirement reporting unit 
earnings multiples used ranged from to times earnings while the discount rate used was 
the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors  including  but not limited to  financial risk  size  geographic diversification  profitability  adequate financial data  and an actively traded stock price 
a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable 
table of contents companies using independent analysts consensus estimates for each company s forecasted earnings 
the multiple is then applied to the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value 
a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the weighted average rate of return  or warr  represents the required rate of return on total capitalization 
it is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax affected cost of debt  which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt in the capital structure 
to estimate the return on equity  we applied the capital asset pricing model  or capm 
the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor s return requirement  and hence a company s cost of equity capital 
capm is determined by beginning with the long term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility  small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company 
the warr calculation is applied to a group of companies considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit 
after completion of step of the analysis  it was determined that fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of the three reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of december  the asset management and international insurance life planner businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their december  carrying values by and  respectively 
the fair value of the retirement full service business  which was calculated based upon application of the discounted cash flow approach utilizing a discount rate of  exceeded the carrying value by 
a decline in forecasted cash flows of  or an increase in the discount rate above  could result in the retirement business failing step and requiring a step assessment 
as of december   we had a total goodwill balance of million  including million related to our retirement reporting unit  million related to our asset management reporting unit  and million related to our international insurance reporting unit 
further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses  or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses  could result in goodwill impairments  resulting in a charge to income 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that due to the severe economic conditions  a triggering event existed in our retirement segment 
the company evaluated the goodwill of the retirement segment s full service business for potential impairment as of march  and determined that a goodwill impairment did not exist  as the fair value of the business  which was calculated by applying a discounted cash flow analysis to its expected future earnings  was greater than its carrying value 
the carrying value of the retirement segment s full service business goodwill was million as of march  during  we recorded a total impairment charge for goodwill of million  which was included in general and administrative expenses 
these impairments reflected the deterioration of financial conditions in and the impact of this deterioration on expected future earnings of these businesses  including for our individual annuities reporting unit  equity market declines and resulting additional market depreciation within separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our anticipated future fee income  for our international investments reporting unit  significant market deterioration resulting in both a reduction in value and an outflow of assets under management which contributed to lower asset management fees earned in the fourth quarter of and expected in future periods and for our prudential real estate and relocation reporting unit  further deterioration of the us housing market  including the number of transactions and the national average home sale price which both declined in the fourth quarter of  and the impact of this decline on future anticipated revenues of this business 
valuation of investments  including derivatives  and the recognition of other than temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities  other invested assets  and derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the values of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps  futures  forwards 
table of contents and options and may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market 
we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
management believes the following accounting policies related to investments  including derivatives  are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives  as referenced below 
valuation of investments  including derivatives recognition of other than temporary impairments determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  our derivatives  and our embedded derivatives at fair value in the statements of financial position

policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves 
table of contents are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by us gaap 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
in recent years  these gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since the closed block had recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  as of december   actual cumulative earnings are below expected cumulative earnings by million  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense 
without the benefit of the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation  these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in our results of operations 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with us gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net us gaap liabilities us  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net us gaap liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we review our mortality assumptions annually 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we generally review our mortality and retirement assumptions annually 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the remaining of the reserves for future policy benefits as of december  represented reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment  and group life and disability and long term care benefits in our group insurance segment 
the optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives  with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of 
table of contents assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features  see valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 
in establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuity policies  we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization  contract lapses and contractholder mortality  as well as interest rates and equity market returns 
assumptions relating to contractholder behavior  such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses  are based on our experience by contract group  and vary by product type and year of issuance 
our dynamic lapse rate assumption applies a different lapse rate on a contract by contract basis based on a comparison of the guaranteed minimum death or income benefit and the current policyholder account value as well as other factors such as the applicability of any surrender charges 
in the money contracts are those with a guaranteed minimum benefit in excess of the current policyholder account value 
since in the money contracts are less likely to lapse  we apply a lower lapse rate assumption to these contracts 
as an example  the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are not in the money and are out of their surrender charge period average between and per year 
this lapse rate assumption would be reduced for similar in the money contracts  based on the extent of the excess described above and the age of the contract 
mortality assumptions are generally based on our historical experience or standard industry tables  and also vary by contract group 
unless a material change in behavior or mortality experience is observed in an interim period  we generally update assumptions related to contract holder behavior and mortality in the third quarter of each year by considering the actual results that have occurred during the period from the most recent update to the expected amounts 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuities products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
for additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see  deferred policy acquisition costs 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuity policies relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change in the reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of the reserves  or any changes on dac or other balances

unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion as of december  is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 

table of contents expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability 
we review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations annually 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
if actual experience results in a different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
our assumed long term rate of return for was for our pension plans and for our other postretirement benefit plans 
given the amount of plan assets as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return 
for the year ended december  increase decrease in net periodic pension cost increase decrease in net periodic other postretirement cost in millions increase in expected rate of return by basis points decrease in expected rate of return by basis points we determine our discount rate  used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the methodology we employ to determine our discount rate 
our assumed discount rate for was for our pension plans and for our other postretirement benefit plans 
given the amount of pensions and postretirement obligation as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate 
for the year ended december  increase decrease in net periodic pension cost increase decrease in net periodic other postretirement cost in millions increase in discount rate by basis points decrease in discount rate by basis points 
table of contents given the application of the authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions  and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate  the change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by basis points would not be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by basis points 
for a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment corporate and other 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors  including the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  whether they are ordinary or capital  in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal  taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions  any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets  and any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
our accounting represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate 
for example  the dividends received deduction  or drd  reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 
the us treasury department and the internal revenue service  or irs  intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the drd related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts 
on february   the obama administration released the general explanations of the administration s revenue proposals 
although the administration has not released proposed statutory language  one proposal would change the method used to determine the amount of the drd 
a change in the drd  including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulation or legislation  could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income 

table of contents on january   we adopted the revised authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns 
the application of this guidance is a two step process  the first step being recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated loss from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in of million 
our liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the irs or other taxing authorities 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
generally  for tax years which produce net operating losses  capital losses or tax credit carryforwards  or tax attributes  the statute of limitations does not close  to the extent of these tax attributes  until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
the statute of limitations for the tax year expired on april  the statute of limitations for the tax year expired on july  the statute of limitations for the and tax years is set to expire in june  unless extended 
tax years through are still open for irs examination 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact in of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has expired 
we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the status of our tax audits  including those of our international affiliates that file separate tax returns and are subject to the audits of the local taxing authority 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure

income loss from continuing operations for the financial services businesses increased billion  from a loss of billion in to income of billion in results in include a billion after tax gain on the sale of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities to wells fargo 
also contributing to the increase in income was a favorable variance related to adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for our variable annuity products  largely reflecting improved market conditions in in addition  income reflects an increase in other revenues  partially offset by an increase in benefits and expenses  due to changes in value of recorded assets and recorded liabilities that are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
results for the current year include a favorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity products 
this variance was largely driven by changes in our adjustment to the embedded derivative liabilities for market perceived non performance risk  and resulted in a related increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
income also includes a net increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income  largely offset by an increase in policyholders benefits  including changes in reserves  reflecting business growth  as well as the impact of currency fluctuations  in our international insurance operations

the direct equity adjustment increased income from continuing operations available to holders of the common stock for earnings per share purposes by million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to holders of the common stock and the class b stock for earnings per share purposes 
the holders of the common stock will benefit from the direct equity adjustment as long as reported administrative expenses of the closed block business are less than the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums 
generally  as statutory cash premiums and policies in force in the closed block business decline  we expect the benefit to the common stock holders from the direct equity adjustment to decline accordingly 
if the reported administrative expenses of the closed block business exceed the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement  the direct equity adjustment will reduce income available to holders of the common stock for earnings per share purposes 
to annual comparison 
income loss from continuing operations for the financial services businesses decreased billion  from income of billion in to a loss of billion in  reflecting the impact of unfavorable market conditions on the results of our segments and investment portfolio 
the decrease reflects pre tax net investment losses in  within both our general account and proprietary investments  and impairments in related to goodwill and declines in value of investments in certain operating joint ventures 
in addition  the decrease reflects reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs reflecting an update of actuarial assumptions primarily due to the impact of market conditions

segment measures in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with authoritative guidance  is our measure of segment performance 
the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses

as discussed below  market performance related adjustments were recognized quarterly beginning in the fourth quarter of amounts for include adjustment recognized as part of our annual reviews in the third quarter of these adjustments primarily reflect the market conditions that existed in the respective periods  and the estimated impact of those market conditions on contractholder behavior  and are discussed individually in more detail below 
also included within the increase in adjusted operating income is a million favorable variance 
table of contents in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features  including changes in our market perceived non performance risk as discussed below 
a corresponding increase in current period gross profits related to this favorable variance led to an offsetting increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs of million 
partially offsetting these increases was million of mark to market losses related to derivative positions associated with our capital hedging program  which we began in the second quarter of  also discussed below 
also serving as a partial offset was a decrease in fee income  driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the declines in average separate account assets were due to market depreciation and transfers of balances to fixed income investments backed by our general account 
the transfer of balances to fixed income investments backed by our general account relates to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features  which  as part of the overall product design  transferred approximately billion out of the separate accounts and into fixed income investments backed by our general account from january  through march   due to equity market declines 
subsequently  in the remainder of  approximately billion was returned from fixed income investments backed by our general account to the separate accounts by operation of the automatic rebalancing element due to market improvements 
higher average annuity account values in investments backed by our general account resulting from these transfers also led to improved investment results  which more than offset the decrease in fee income 
the million of benefits in relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments shown in the table above are attributable to changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance in the following table shows the actual quarterly rate of return on variable annuity account values for each of the quarters in compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross profits 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter actual rate of return expected rate of return the overall better than expected market returns in increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  by establishing a new  higher starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods 
the previously expected rates of return for  for most contract groups  was based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption under the reversion to the mean approach  as discussed below 
the increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions  which are applied to all prior periods 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions are recognized in the current period 
in addition  the lower rate of amortization and reserve provisions will also be applied in calculating amortization and the provision for reserves in future periods 
the  million charge in is attributable to a similar but opposite impact on gross profits of market value decreases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  reflecting financial market conditions during the period 
included within the million of increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs for is a million loss recognition charge to further reduce the balance of valuation of business acquired  or voba  related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
the additional charge was required in as the voba balance for those contracts otherwise would have been in excess of the present value of estimated future gross profits 
in addition  the million decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs for is net of a million charge to impair the entire remaining voba balance related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
the additional charge was required in the first quarter of  as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero 
since the voba balance was completely impaired for these contracts  it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods 
as shown in the table above  results for both periods include the impact of the annual reviews of the assumptions used in the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy 
table of contents acquisition and other costs 
the year ended december  included million of charges from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in the future rate of return assumptions applied to the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products 
partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions were benefits related to the impact of lower mortality and higher investment spread assumptions 
adjusted operating income for included million of charges from these annual reviews  primarily reflecting increased cost of expected income and death benefit claims due to lower expected lapse rates for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit 
as mentioned above  we derive our near term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  the projected future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most contract groups was greater than our maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
in those cases  we utilize the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits 
as discussed above  the near term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach was reduced in from to as part of our annual reviews 
included in this revised blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a annual maximum rate of return on equity investments 
further or continued market volatility could result in additional market value changes within our separate account assets and corresponding changes to our gross profits  as well as additional adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
given that the estimates of future gross profits are based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption for most contract groups  all else being equal  future rates of return higher or lower than per quarter  or per annum  will result in decreases or increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
including the offsetting impact of certain contract groups relating to business issued in  our weighted average expected rate of return across all contract groups is per annum as of december  the quarterly adjustments for current period experience shown in the table above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change  and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods amortization  referred to as an adjustment for current period experience  may be required in the current period 
this adjustment to previous periods amortization is in addition to the direct impact of actual gross profits on current period amortization and the market performance related adjustment to our estimates of gross profits for future periods 
the adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs in reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits  resulting primarily from the favorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features and better than expected contract persistency experience 
the adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products in primarily reflects higher than expected fee income due to market increases  partially offset by higher than expected actual contract guarantee claims costs due to lower than expected lapses 
less favorable than expected gross profits in were primarily due to lower than expected fee income  the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features  and higher actual contract guarantee claims costs in  primarily driven by unfavorable financial market conditions 
the million favorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features referred to above reflects a benefit of million in compared to a charge of million in the benefit in includes million of net benefits related to updates of the inputs used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities  including a million benefit related to an update to reflect a market perceived increase in our own risk of non performance 
the remaining million of net charges was primarily driven by a reduction in the expected lapse rate assumption based on our actual lapse experience  partially offset by the inclusion of new market inputs for implied volatility 
table of contents as well as updated assumptions for other actuarial and capital markets inputs 
in light of recent developments  including rating agency downgrades to the claims paying ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  beginning in the first quarter of  we incorporated an additional spread over libor into the discount rate used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities to reflect an increase in our market perceived non performance risk  thereby reducing the value of the embedded derivative liabilities 
the million charge in included an million benefit related to an update of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  primarily driven by an update of the equity volatility assumption to better match the actual equity indices referenced 
excluding the million of net benefits related to updates of the inputs used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our living benefit features  the hedging activities resulted in a million benefit in  reflecting a  million benefit related to the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives  partially offset by a  million charge related to the change in the fair value of the related hedge positions 
the hedging activities in  excluding similar assumption updates  resulted in a million charge  reflecting a  million charge related to the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives  partially offset by a  million benefit related to the change in the fair value of the related hedge positions 
variances for both periods are primarily driven by differences in the actual performance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilize as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
given the sensitivity of the fair value of both the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions to financial market conditions  the variance related to the mark to market of these items for a given period will be largely dependent on the financial market conditions throughout the period 
for additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with our living benefit features  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 
the primary risk exposures of these optional living benefit features relate to actual deviations from  or changes to  the assumptions used in their original pricing  including equity market returns  interest rates  market volatility  timing of annuitization and withdrawals  contract lapses and contractholder mortality 
together with certain product design elements  our hedging program is designed to limit our exposure to the equity market  interest rate  and market volatility risk inherent in the living benefit features of certain variable annuity products  as part of our overall risk management strategy 
in the second quarter of  we began the expansion of our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business  including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures 
these capital hedges primarily consist of equity based total return swaps  as well as interest rate derivatives  which are designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products 
in  favorable market conditions resulted in an overall improvement in our capital position  which was partially offset by million of mark to market losses on the capital hedges

adjusted operating income decreased  million  from income of million in to a loss of  million in adjusted operating income for included charges of  million  reflecting the impact of the annual reviews of  and market performance adjustment to  the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the total charge of  million in included million of charges from the annual reviews  which were completed in the third quarter of  and million of charges relating to additional market performance adjustments in the fourth quarter of adjusted operating income for included million of benefits from the annual reviews 
the charges from the annual reviews of million in included million relating to reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and million related to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the charge relating to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs primarily reflects the impact on gross profits of market value decreases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products 
the reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products also reflects this impact  as well as increased cost of expected income and death benefit claims due to lower 
table of contents expected lapse rates for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit 
adjusted operating income for included million of benefits from the annual reviews  reflecting market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  and decreased cost of actual and expected death claims  partially offset by the impact of model refinements and higher expected lapse rates for the variable annuity business acquired from allstate 
as discussed above  results for also include million of charges associated with market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance in the fourth quarter of in light of recent market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we determined that adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and any corresponding changes to the future rate of return assumptions should no longer be dependent on a comparison to a statistically generated range of estimated gross profits 
instead  for purposes of evaluating deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products  total estimated gross profits are updated for these items each quarter 
market value declines in the fourth quarter of decreased our estimates of total gross profits by establishing a new  lower starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating gross profits for future periods 
the decrease in our estimate of total gross profits results in a higher required rate of amortization  which is applied to all prior periods gross profits 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization is recognized in the current period 
in addition  the higher rate of amortization will also be applied to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
as noted above  prior to the fourth quarter of market performance related adjustments were included as part of our annual reviews 
the charges from the annual reviews of million in included million of adjustments for unfavorable market performance  as discussed above 
we continue to derive our future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
however  beginning in the second half of  the projected future rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most contract groups was greater than  our maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types as of december  for this business 
in those cases we utilized the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean  and further decreasing our estimate of total gross profits 
the above adjustment for market performance included million relating to increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs and million relating to reserve increases for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
included within the million of increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs is a million loss recognition charge to further reduce the balance of valuation of business acquired  or voba  related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
the additional charge was required as the voba balance for those contracts otherwise would have been in excess of the present value of estimated future gross profits 
absent the effect of the annual reviews and market performance adjustments discussed above  adjusted operating income for decreased million from contributing to this decrease is a million unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features 
the unfavorable variance in our hedging results reflects a charge of million in compared to a benefit of million in  and was largely due to unfavorable basis risk  primarily reflecting the underperformance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilized as a basis for developing our hedging strategy  driven by financial market conditions in the charge in includes an million benefit for an update of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives  primarily relating to an update of implied volatility ratios to better match the actual equity indices referenced 
given the sensitivity of the fair value of both the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions to financial market conditions  the variance related to the mark to market of these items for a given period will be largely dependent on the financial market conditions throughout the period 
also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in fee income  driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the declines in separate account 
table of contents assets were due to market depreciation and transfers of balances to fixed income investments backed by our general account 
the transfer of balances to fixed income investments backed by our general account relates to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our living benefit features  which  as part of the overall product design  transferred approximately billion in  out of the separate accounts and into fixed income investments backed by our general account due to equity market declines 
higher average annuity account values in investments backed by our general account resulting from these transfers also led to improved investment results  which partially offset the decrease in fee income 
also serving as a partial offset to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs  absent the effect of the annual reviews and market performance adjustments discussed above 
the decrease primarily reflects the impact on gross profits of the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features and the decrease in fee income  partially offset by the quarterly adjustments for current period experience  as explained below 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the cumulative impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change  and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods costs  referred to as an adjustment for current period experience  may be required 
adjusted operating income for includes charges of million relating to these quarterly adjustments  due to less favorable than expected experience  while includes benefits of million due to better than expected experience 
the adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs totaled million in and resulted from less favorable than expected gross profits  due primarily to lower than expected fee income and the unfavorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features 
in addition to these drivers  the adjustments for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products in  which totaled million  also reflected higher actual contract guarantee claims costs in  primarily driven by financial market conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we impaired the entire million of goodwill related to our acquisition of the variable annuity business of allstate 
this impairment is reflective of continued deterioration of financial market conditions  which resulted in additional market depreciation within our separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our fee income and overall expected future earnings for our individual annuities business

this favorable variance was partially offset by million of mark to market losses related to derivative positions associated with our capital hedging program  as discussed above  as well as a decrease in fee income driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts 
the decline in average separate account asset balances was due to net market depreciation and the transfer of balances to fixed income investments backed by our general account relating to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features

partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  absent the effect of the items mentioned above  and a million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  on this basis  reflects a favorable variance related to the million goodwill impairment recognized in  and lower amortization of voba subsequent to the complete impairment in the first quarter of of balances related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate  as discussed above

individual variable annuity gross sales decreased by billion  from billion in to billion in and individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals decreased by billion  from billion in to billion in  reflecting the decrease in both inflows and outflows which generally occurs during periods of market volatility and equity market decline 
the decrease in individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals also reflects lower lapses for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit 
variable annuity net amount at risk as a result of the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets  in recent years we have seen significant increases in the net amounts at risk embedded in our variable annuity products with riders that include optional living and guaranteed minimum death benefit features 
the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder s current account balance 
as part of our risk management strategy we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the risks associated with our variable annuity products  primarily through a combination of product design elements  such as an automatic rebalancing element  and externally purchased hedging instruments 
the rate of return we realize from our variable annuity contracts can vary by contract based on our risk management strategy  including the impact on any capital markets risks that we hedge  and the impact on that portion of our variable annuity contracts that benefit from the automatic rebalancing element 
the automatic rebalancing element  included in the design of certain optional living benefits  transfers assets between the variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and  depending on the benefit feature  fixed income investments backed by our general account or a separate account bond portfolio 
the transfers are based on a static mathematical formula which considers a number of factors  including the performance of the contractholder selected investments 
in general  negative investment performance results in transfers to fixed income investments backed by our general account or separate account bond portfolio  and positive investment performance results in transfers back to contractholder selected investments 
overall  the automatic rebalancing element is designed to help limit our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility

the increase in our full service business was primarily related to improved investment results  driven by higher net yields due to the impact of lower crediting rates on general account liabilities  resulting from rate resets  as well as higher average invested assets in our general account reflecting full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products 
our ability to maintain current net yields  which are impacted by the levels of interest rates  the pace and extent of changes in interest rates and the minimum guaranteed crediting rates on our general account stable value products  may affect investment results in future periods 
also contributing to the increase in the full service business was a million favorable variance in the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts  reflecting a benefit of million in and a charge of million in the benefit in was driven by the impact of a reduction in equity market volatility on these benefit features 
the charge in was driven by the impact of changes in equity market prices and volatility on these benefit features  prior to the implementation of our hedging of equity market price risk during the fourth quarter of serving as a partial offset to these increases was lower asset based fees  due to a decrease in average full service fee based retirement account values  primarily resulting from equity market depreciation and full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and 
table of contents mutual fund products to our general account stable value products  as well as fee concessions made to certain existing clients 
although account value declines in and early due to equity market depreciation were partially offset by recent large plan sales  in some instances these cases provide for more limited product offerings than existing business  and consequently a lower contribution to asset based fees 
the decrease in our institutional investment products business primarily reflects a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements of million  primarily due to a smaller benefit in related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business  as well as less favorable case experience related to our group annuity blocks of business 
partially offsetting this decrease was improved investment results and a favorable variance in the mark to market of equity investments required in certain of our separate account products 
the increase in investment results was primarily due to increased net settlements on interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio  and the impact of the maturity of a single large guaranteed investment contract which had an interest crediting rate substantially in excess of our general account invested asset yield 
the increase in net swap settlements resulted from a higher notional amount of swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio and the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on those swaps 
as we continued to manage the duration gap between assets and liabilities within our risk management framework  the use of interest rate swaps to increase the duration of the investment portfolio grew in as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of swaps declined 
the investment portfolio duration has generally declined relative to the liabilities as a result of purchases of fixed income securities with shorter duration than the duration of our liabilities and higher levels of short term investments discussed below 
partially offsetting these increases in investment results was a lower benefit from the accretion into net investment income of fixed maturity other than temporary impairments recognized in previous periods 
such accretion did not contribute to results for due to our adoption of new authoritative guidance related to fixed maturity other than temporary impairments on january  also serving as partial offsets were a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled withdrawals of our guaranteed investment products and lower yields  including the impact of declining short term interest rates and a higher balance of investments in lower yielding assets  such as cash and short term investments  for liquidity purposes 
higher levels of short term liquidity have been maintained in to provide additional capacity to address changing cash needs during the current market conditions 
investment results in future periods may be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace maturities of guaranteed investment products with new additions

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in the increase in adjusted operating income reflects improved earnings from variable products  which benefited from lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  driven by the impact of more favorable equity markets in on separate account fund performance 
separate account fund performance above expected levels results in an increase in total future gross profits on which the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves is based  and accordingly  lower amortization in the current period 
the prior year period contained higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of higher amortization of unearned revenue reserves in comparison to the current year  due to actual separate account performance that was below expected levels 
results in also benefited from gains on separate account fund liquidations associated with variable policy lapses and surrenders in compared to losses on these liquidations in due to policyholder options under some of the variable contracts  lapses may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this lag being borne by the company 
partially offsetting these items was the impact on variable product 
table of contents profitability of a decrease in asset based fees due to lower average separate account asset balances in reflecting the impact of the unfavorable equity markets in late and early  as well as expected runoff of older variable policies 
more favorable mortality experience  net of reinsurance  in compared to as well as higher earnings from growth in term and universal life insurance in force also contributed to the increase in adjusted operating income 
adjusted operating income for also includes a benefit of million from annual reviews of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves as well as for establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit features in certain contracts 
results for include a benefit of million from the annual assumption review 
in addition  results for include a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  while results for the prior year include a similar benefit of million 
these compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiation periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive 
the largest of these arrangements was revised effective in late and the profit opportunities will be significantly reduced in and beyond 
the benefit of million in related to the annual review of assumptions reflects higher investment spread assumptions and improved future mortality expectations  partially offset by updates to interest rate assumptions which increased the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death benefit features in certain contracts 
in addition  the review of assumptions in reflects a reduction in our future rate of return assumption  which reduced the benefit to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization on unearned revenue reserves 
the benefit of million in primarily reflects improved future mortality expectations 
we derive our near term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  the projected near term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach was greater than our near term maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
as a result  we utilized the near term maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits 
the near term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to mean approach was reduced in third quarter of from to as part of our annual assumption review 
included in this revised blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes  including a annual maximum rate of return on equity investments 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from million in to million in adjusted operating income for includes a million benefit from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs due to an increased estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  based on an annual review  primarily reflecting improved future mortality expectations based on improvements in recent mortality experience on our in force business  compared to a similar benefit for million from the annual review in results for also include a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute  while results for include a similar benefit amounting to million 
these compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiation periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive 
the largest of these arrangements has been renegotiated and the profit opportunities will be significantly reduced in and beyond 
absent the effect of these items  adjusted operating income for decreased million from the prior year 
on this basis  the decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to a net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  primarily reflecting the impact of unfavorable equity markets on both separate account fund performance  including the impact of a corresponding change to the future rate of return assumptions  and variable product policy persistency 
also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income in was a decrease in asset based fees due to lower separate account asset balances reflecting the impact of the unfavorable equity markets  as well as losses on separate account fund liquidations associated with variable policy lapses and surrenders 
due to policyholder options under some of the variable contracts  lapses may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this lag being borne by the company 
these decreases were partially offset by higher product margins from growth in term and universal life insurance in force and improved mortality experience  net of reinsurance  compared to the prior year 
the net increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves includes the impact of actual market performance on both actual profits and estimated 
table of contents future gross profits  used as the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs 
as stated above  we derive our future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the projected future rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach was greater than  our maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business 
as a result  we utilized the maximum future rate of return over the four year period  thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean  and decreasing our estimate of total gross profits 
revenues to annual comparison

international insurance and investments division impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent earnings 
the operations of our international insurance and international investments segments are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar earnings from period to period even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
as discussed further below  we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  as well as dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams  thereby reducing earnings volatility from unfavorable and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment and international investments segment  excluding the global commodities group  for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segments non us dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations executes forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings from the hedged currency in exchange for us dollars at specified exchange rates 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
this program is primarily associated with the international insurance segment s businesses in japan  korea and taiwan and the international investments segment s businesses in korea and europe 
the intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations increased decreased revenues and adjusted operating income of each segment as follows for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions impact on revenues and adjusted operating income international insurance international investments total international insurance and investments division 
table of contents results of corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period  which includes the impact of any over or under hedge of actual earnings as a result of projected earnings differing from actual earnings 
the net impact of this program recorded within the corporate and other operations were gains of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the notional amount of these forward currency contracts was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  of which billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  related to our japanese insurance operations 
dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments in addition  our japanese insurance operations also hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans 
the principal of these dual currency investments are yen denominated while the related interest income is us dollar denominated 
these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollar interest income 
our japanese insurance operations also hold investments in yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for us dollars at the us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
as of december  and  the notional amount of these investments was billion  or billion  and billion  or billion  respectively  based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired 
for the years ended december   and  the weighted average yield generated by these investments was  and  respectively

the present value of the earnings reflected in the table above  on a us dollar denominated basis  is billion as of december  the table above does not reflect the forward currency income hedging program 
table of contents discussed above 
in establishing the level of yen denominated earnings that will be hedged through the forward currency income hedging program we take into account the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as well as the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by us dollar denominated products and investments  which are discussed in greater detail below 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on equity hedges of us gaap equity and available economic capital we also seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies 
we are in the process of refining our current capital management framework  which includes available economic capital  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources prudential financial management of capital  and as we further develop this framework  or as other events occur  we may alter this strategy 
available economic capital represents the excess of the fair value of assets over the fair value of liabilities for the current in force block of business 
in our japanese insurance operations we currently seek to hedge a portion of estimated available economic capital and other measures of value  including the amount attributable to the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations  which totaled billion as of december  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income components of equity and certain other adjustments 
we hedge a portion of the estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations through a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated assets 
these assets are financed with yen denominated liabilities and equity held in our japanese insurance operations 
in addition  we may also hedge estimated available economic capital using instruments held in our us domiciled entities  such as us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen 
in certain of our other foreign insurance operations  the us gaap equity exposure is mitigated by entering into forward currency contracts that generally qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and by holding us dollar denominated investments 
during the second quarter of  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of our korean operations due to a variety of considerations  including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from a strengthening korean won 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the instruments serving as hedges of our estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations amounted to billion  a decrease of billion from the billion hedged as of december  these instruments were principally comprised of available for sale us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion and held to maturity us dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of billion held in our japanese insurance operations  as well as billion of net yen denominated liabilities held in our us domiciled entities  including a portion that has been converted to yen using swaps 
the effects of the yen denominated liabilities are reported in corporate and other operations 
these amounts do not reflect the forward currency income hedging program or dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above  which when added to the billion of instruments serving as an equity hedge of a portion of the estimated available economic capital  results in a total estimated available economic capital hedge of approximately billion as of december  in addition  as discussed below  we have billion of us dollar assets supporting us dollar liabilities related to us dollar denominated products issued by our japanese operations  which when added to the billion of total estimated available economic capital hedge  results in total us dollar instruments of approximately billion as of december  available for sale investments under us gaap are carried at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value except as described below for impairments  including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within equity 
changes in the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations due to foreign currency exchange rate movements are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustments  and can serve as an offset to the unrealized changes in fair value of the available for sale investments 
for the portion of available for sale investments that support our japanese insurance operations us gaap equity this offset creates a natural equity hedge 
for those us dollar denominated investments  including available for sale investments  that support the portion of estimated available economic capital above our us gaap equity there is no offsetting impact to equity 
in addition  the impact of foreign currency 
table of contents exchange rate movements on the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations is partially offset by foreign currency exchange related changes in designated yen denominated debt and other hedging instruments held in our us domiciled entities and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustments 
the investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  with the related change in value recorded within asset management fees and other income 
the remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these investments is excluded from adjusted operating income  as part of our application of the hedge of available economic capital 
the us dollar denominated investments that hedge a portion of our estimated available economic capital in our japanese insurance operations pay a coupon  which is reflected within net investment income  and  therefore  included in adjusted operating income  which is approximately to basis points greater than what a similar yen based investment would pay 
the incremental impact of this higher yield on our us denominated investments  as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above  will vary over time  and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investment  as well as interest rate environments in the us and japan at the time of the investment 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments investment results for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations 
because these us dollar denominated investments are recorded on the books of yen based entities  foreign currency exchange movements will impact their value 
to the extent the value of the yen strengthens as compared to the us dollar  the value of these us dollar denominated investments will decrease as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
upon the ultimate sale or maturity of the us dollar denominated investments  any realized change in value related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the income statement and  excluded from adjusted operating income 
similarly  other than temporary impairments on these investments may include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which in certain circumstances will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the income statement  and  as such  excluded from adjusted operating income 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of our policies regarding impairments 
we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of our us dollar denominated investments and negatively impact the equity of our yen based entities by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries international insurance and investments subsidiaries for a discussion of our internal hedging strategies 
we also incorporate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the remaining us dollar denominated net asset position of our japanese insurance operations  which primarily relates to accrued investment income  as part of our overall application of the hedge of available economic capital 
these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  as they are non yen denominated items on the books of yen based entities  and the related change in value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
as these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are included in the determination of the japanese insurance operations level of available economic capital  we exclude all remeasurement related to these items from adjusted operating income 
in addition  as of december  and  our international insurance operations also had billion and billion  respectively  of foreign currency exposure from us dollar liabilities for us dollar denominated products issued by these operations 
a portion of these liabilities are coinsured to our us domiciled insurance operations and supported by us dollar denominated assets 
for the us dollar liabilities retained in japan  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments  including a significant portion that are designated as available for sale  and other related us dollar denominated net assets  primarily accrued investment income  to support these products 
the change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  or remeasurement  of the related us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these products is excluded from adjusted operating income

revenues from gibraltar life increased million  from billion in to billion in  including a favorable impact of million from currency fluctuations 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  revenues for gibraltar life increased million  from billion in to billion in this increase reflects a million increase in premiums  from billion in to billion in  as premiums benefited million from additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to the final payment under a special dividend arrangement established as part of gibraltar life s reorganization in for which includes no such benefit 
substantially all of the premiums recognized pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were offset by a corresponding charge to increase reserves for the affected policies 
also reflected in premiums is million of renewal premiums from the acquisition of yamato  as well as higher sales of single premium whole life during due to the long term nature of many of the products we sell in japan  we have historically sought to add duration exposure to our japanese investment portfolio by employing various strategies  including investing in longer term securities or  by entering into long duration floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
these strategies better support the characteristics of our long dated product liabilities  and have resulted in higher portfolio yields 
based on an evaluation of market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  we terminated or offset many of these interest rate swaps in consideration of  among other things  the interest rate environment 
the resulting realized investment gains from terminating or offsetting these interest rate swaps will be recognized in adjusted operating income over periods that generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives 
for and  we recognized gains of million and losses of million  respectively  in adjusted operating income related to these realized investment gains losses 
as of december   million of deferred gains remain to be recognized in adjusted operating income over a weighted average period of years 
we continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities  and we expect to resume implementing these hedging strategies in to lengthen the duration of our japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions dictates 
as we do so  the impact to our portfolio yields upon the resumption of these strategies will depend on the then current interest rate environment

premiums decreased million from billion in to billion in  driven primarily by a decrease in single pay premiums and lower renewal premiums reflecting the attrition of existing business

sales results in managing our international insurance business  we analyze revenues  as well as annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap 
annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
annualized new business premiums include of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products 
annualized new business premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions annualized new business premiums on an actual exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total on a constant exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total to annual comparison 
on a constant exchange rate basis  annualized new business premiums increased million  from billion in to billion in annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our life planner operations increased million  primarily due to higher sales in korea and taiwan mostly reflective of the improving economic environment 
the increased sales in korea also reflect higher sales in the fourth quarter in advance of price increases effective january  the number of life planners increased by  or  from  as of december  to  as of december   driven by increases of in brazil  in taiwan  in poland  and in korea 
during the same period  the number of life planners in japan increased by  reflective of the transfer of life planners to gibraltar over the last twelve months  primarily in support of our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution and to service orphaned policyholders 
factoring in these transfers  the number of life planners would have increased  from december  to december  prior to december   an additional japanese life planners were transferred to gibraltar 

table of contents annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our gibraltar life operation increased million  primarily due to higher sales of protection products in our bank distribution channels 
the number of life advisors increased by  from  as of december  to  as of december   as new hires and life planners transferred to gibraltar as life advisors over the last twelve months were offset by resignations and terminations due to failure to meet minimum sales production standards 
the remaining life planners transferred to gibraltar  as discussed above  are not considered life advisors

on a constant exchange rate basis  annualized new business premiums increased million  from billion in to billion in annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our life planner operations decreased million 
sales through the first nine months of were relatively flat  with growth in japan offset by a decline in korea reflecting the continued competitive market environment 
however  due to the economic environment and concerns over us financial institutions  sales in the fourth quarter of declined from the prior year quarter  with declines in both japan and korea 
the number of life planners increased  or  from  as of december  to  as of december   driven by increases of in taiwan  in korea  and in argentina 
during  life planners in japan were transferred to gibraltar primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution 
factoring in these transfers  the number of life planners in japan would have increased  from december  to december   which reflects lower recruiting in japan in the later part of due to a more selective screening process meant to further improve life planner retention and quality  as well as recruiting challenges posed by the economic environment 
annualized new business premiums  on a constant exchange rate basis  from our gibraltar life operation increased million  primarily reflecting strong sales of a new us dollar denominated retirement income product launched in the first quarter of  as well as higher sales of our us dollar denominated fixed annuity product and a new single premium yen denominated endowment product 
the number of life advisors increased by  from  as of december  to  as of december   as we continue to focus on hiring practices to enhance retention and productivity 
the life planners transferred to gibraltar as discussed above  are not considered life advisors  as they sell only through the bank channel 
investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
authorities in some jurisdictions regulate interest rates guaranteed in our insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products sold in japan  other than those sold by gibraltar life  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables 
our mortality and morbidity experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended december    and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

adjusted operating income increased million  from a loss of million in to income of million in  primarily reflecting prior year impairment charges of million related to operating joint ventures and goodwill  as discussed below 
excluding these impairments  adjusted operating income decreased million from the prior year 
the decrease reflects lower results from the segment s global commodities group due to less favorable sales and trading results and a lower benefit from market value changes on securities relating to exchange memberships in  partially offset by a million credit loss related to a brokerage client that was recorded in also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income were lower results from the segment s asset management businesses  primarily in our korean operation  reflecting the conclusion of revenues received under an agreement with the korean government

adjusted operating income decreased million  from income of million in to a loss of million in  primarily reflecting impairment charges of million related to operating joint ventures and goodwill

these operating joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and the impairments related to our joint ventures in italy  brazil and mexico 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million associated with the segment s asset management businesses 
both the goodwill and joint venture impairments reflect the significant deterioration in financial market conditions that occurred during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a decline in our anticipated future asset management and transaction based fees  and hence a decrease in the expected future earnings of the segment s asset management businesses 
as of december   the remaining carrying value of our operating joint ventures and goodwill was million and million  respectively  related to the segment s asset management businesses 
there are no operating joint ventures or goodwill associated with the segment s global commodities group

also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income is the benefit in of a million gain from the sale of the segment s oppenheim joint ventures and a million gain from recoveries related to a former investment of the segment s korean asset management operation 
the decrease also reflects lower results from the segment s asset management businesses  primarily in our korean operation  as well as lower results from the segment s global commodities group 
the decrease in earnings for the global commodities group is driven by lower gains on securities relating to exchange memberships  which benefited by million  while benefiting by million  as well as a million credit loss related to a brokerage client that was recorded in the first quarter of the adjusted operating income of our korean asset management operation includes fee revenue from the korean government under the agreement discussed above of million and million in and  respectively

investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase  since december  of substantially all of our convertible senior notes  the proceeds of which had been invested primarily in short term investments  as well as lower earnings on other invested assets 
capital debt interest expense increased million due to a greater level of capital debt  which includes the issuance in june of billion of junior subordinated notes and reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes in previously  these proceeds were used to support an asset portfolio within the retirement segment for which the company has employed a substitute funding source  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
also contributing to the greater loss from corporate operations in are increased losses from other corporate activities  which reflects an increase in our deferred compensation liabilities and other retained corporate expenses 
the increased losses were partially offset by a decline in the level of costs related to our retained obligations to certain policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life sales practice remediation 
both our deferred compensation liabilities and our retained obligations to certain policyholders are impacted by financial market conditions 
corporate operations pension income and employee benefits decreased million 
the decrease reflects increased post retirement benefit costs due to the amortization of prior year losses and lower investment returns due to the lower asset base reflective of market conditions in late and early  partially offset by an increase in income from our qualified pension plan

giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors  we expect on a consolidated basis income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in  but at a level of about million to million higher than that of the year other postretirement benefit expenses will decrease in a range of million to million 
the decrease in other postretirement benefit expense is driven primarily by a change in the discount rate from to  and an increase in plan asset values  which was partially offset by a change in the expected rate of return from to

adjusted operating income from corporate operations decreased million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in capital debt interest expense increased by million due to increased borrowings  which includes the issuance in june of billion of junior subordinated notes 
in addition  corporate operations investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense  decreased million  primarily reflecting lower earnings from the investment of proceeds from our convertible debt issues  as discussed below  and lower yields on invested assets 
partially offsetting these items was the benefit from other corporate activities of million  reflecting a decline in our deferred compensation liabilities and other compensation related items in versus the prior year  as well as lower costs associated with philanthropic activities and other retained corporate expenses

the notes were repurchased at a discount resulting in a pre tax gain of million  which is included in other corporate activities 
corporate operations pension income and employee benefits increased million  which primarily reflects the impact of census and other demographic assumption updates to our post retirement and post employment benefit plans 
income from our qualified pension plan decreased million  from million in to million in  reflecting the impact of the transfer in april of billion in plan assets within the qualified pension plan under section of the internal revenue code from assets supporting pension benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits 
however  as a result of the transfer  the decline in income from our qualified pension plan was offset by a corresponding decline in other postretirement benefit expenses 
results of operations of closed block business we established the closed block business effective as of the date of demutualization 
the closed block business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies 
we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies 
see overview closed block business for additional details 
each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block  including investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains  mortality experience and other factors 
although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum 
table of contents future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
as of january   the company recognized an adjusted cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation of million to closed block policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings  which reflects a cumulative adjustment of million related to the company s adoption of the revised authoritative guidance for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  effective january  as of december   actual cumulative earnings are below the expected cumulative earnings by million  thereby eliminating the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies 
furthermore  the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block  are not sufficient to overcome the cumulative earnings shortfall and therefore  the policyholder dividend obligation balance as of december  remains at zero 
operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the closed block business 
consequently  results of the closed block business for all periods are presented only in accordance with us gaap 
the following table sets forth the closed block business us gaap results for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions us gaap results revenues benefits and expenses income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures to annual comparison 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased million  from income of million in to a loss of million in results for include a decrease of billion in net realized investment gains losses  from gains of million in to losses of billion in  primarily due to a net decrease in the market value of derivatives used in duration management programs 
for a discussion of closed block business realized investment gains losses  net  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
net investment income  net of interest expense  decreased million  primarily related to lower portfolio yields  including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets and reinvestments at lower yields  as well as a decrease in income on joint ventures and limited partnership investments accounted for under the equity method 
these decreases to income were partially offset by a decrease of million in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders  primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scales for and in addition  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased million reflecting the impact of investment losses on actual gross margins for the period compared to the previously estimated expected gross margins for the period 
during  the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation was reduced from million to zero  and was a partial offset to the decline in earnings as discussed above 
in  the change in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend 
table of contents obligation of million was an offset to the decline in earnings in the period 
as noted above  as of december  actual cumulative earnings are below the expected cumulative earnings by million 
there will be no cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation until this amount is recovered

commercial mortgage securitization operations in  we classified our commercial mortgage securitization operations as a divested business  reflecting our decision to exit this business 
these operations  which involved the origination and purchase of commercial mortgage loans that we in turn would aggregate and sell into commercial mortgage backed securitization transactions  together with related hedging activities  were previously reported within the asset management segment 
we retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination  servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities  which remain a part of our asset management segment 
as of december   our commercial mortgage securitization operations held a loan with a principal balance of million  whose fair value continues to be subject to changes in credit spreads

table of contents investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments  are experience rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the investments supporting these experience rated products  excluding commercial mortgage and other loans  are classified as trading and are carried at fair value 
these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in asset management fees and other income 
interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in net investment income 
commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience rated products are carried at unpaid principal  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses  and are reflected on the statements of financial position as commercial mortgage and other loans 
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities 
this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis 
in addition  to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments  adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans supporting these experience rated contracts  which are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances 
the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience rated contracts  and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments  both realized and unrealized  that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders 
results for the years ended december   and include the recognition of net investment gains of billion  net investment losses of billion  and net investment gains of zero million  respectively  on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value 
these net investment gains and losses primarily represent interest rate related mark to market adjustments  which include the impact of changes in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities 
consistent with our treatment of realized investment gains losses  net  these gains and losses  which are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders  are excluded from adjusted operating income 
in addition  results for the years ended december   and include an increase of million  and decreases of billion and million  respectively  in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments that support these experience rated contracts 
these liability changes are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances and are also excluded from adjusted operating income 
net investment gains and losses net of the increase decrease in contractholder liabilities due to these asset valuation changes resulted in net gains of million in and net losses of million in this primarily reflects timing differences between the recognition of the interest rate related mark to market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these mark to market adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
decreases to these contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of million as of december  and million as of december  we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
in addition  as prescribed by us gaap  changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held in our general account  other than when associated with impairments  are not recognized in income in the current period  while the impact of these changes in value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period 
included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are increases of million  decreases of million  and increases of million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value established a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these levels

the determination of fair value  which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions  can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as discussed in more detail below  the determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities may require the application of a greater degree of judgment given recent market conditions  as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be 
table of contents significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner 
for a description of the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections provide additional information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our financial services businesses and our closed block business which are valued using level inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding separate account assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is ultimately borne by our customers and policyholders 
fixed maturity and equity securities public fixed maturity securities included in level in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally developed valuations or non binding broker quotes 
despite the dislocated markets and low levels of liquidity in and  except for our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages as discussed below  the pricing we received from independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value for the remainder of our public fixed maturity portfolio 
as a result  for public fixed maturity securities we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing services under our normal pricing protocol 
securities with prices based on validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within level for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities  the discounted cash flow or other valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs 
such securities are also included in level in our fair value hierarchy 
as of december  our level fixed maturity securities included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages with a fair value of  million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we reported fair values for these sub prime securities which were net million higher than the estimated fair values received from third party pricing services or brokers  based on our determination that as of december   the market for asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages was an inactive market 
we considered both third party pricing information and an internally developed price based on a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair value of certain of these securities 
based on the unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow model and the limited observable market activity  these securities were included in level the million net increase in fair value included million relating to available for sale securities  with million related to securities attributable to our financial services businesses and million related to securities attributable to our closed block business 
the increase to the fair value of these available for sale securities resulted in a corresponding increase  net of taxes  to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net 
the remaining million increase in fair value related to trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities in our financial services business  and resulted in a corresponding increase in asset management fees and other income 
excluding these asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  as of december  about billion of level fixed maturity securities were public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on non binding broker quotes  and about billion were private fixed maturities  with values primarily based on internally developed models 
significant unobservable inputs used included issue specific credit adjustments  material non public financial information  management judgment  estimation of future earnings and cash flows  default rate assumptions  liquidity assumptions and non binding quotes from market makers 
these inputs are usually considered unobservable  as not all market participants will have access to this data 
as of december  we classified approximately million of our investments in asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages as level  primarily reflecting securities valued based on non binding broker quotes 
the vast majority of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages were valued as of december  using information from independent pricing services  and were included in level overall  about half of our level fixed maturity securities as of december  were public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on non binding broker quotes  and about half were private fixed maturities  with values primary based on internally developed models 
for additional information regarding our holdings of asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  see  realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities asset backed securities 
while the fair value of these investments 
table of contents are in a significant unrealized loss position due to increased credit spreads and illiquidity in the financial markets  we believe the ultimate value that will be realized from these investments is greater than that reflected by their current fair value 
the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net  a separate component of equity 
our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
other long term investments the fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process 
the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model  following an income approach that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue  operating expenses and discount rates 
these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually  and incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data  including any market transactions 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation  the real estate investments within other long term investments have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
consolidated real estate investment funds classified as level as of december  and december  totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our direct investment in these funds is not material  and the majority of the assets recorded as a result of the consolidation of these funds is offset by a noncontrolling interest reflected as a separate component of equity 
the noncontrolling interest is not considered to be fair value and therefore is not included in fair value reporting above 
derivative instruments derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets  within other trading account assets  or other long term investments  or as liabilities  within other liabilities  except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract 
the fair values of derivative contracts are determined based on quoted prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models  and are affected by changes in market factors including non performance risk 
the majority of our derivative positions are traded in the over the counter  or otc  derivative market and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy since they have bid and ask prices that are actively quoted or can be readily obtained from external market data providers 
our policy is to use mid market pricing consistent with our best estimate of fair value 
the bid ask spreads for otc derivatives classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are generally wider than derivatives classified within level thus requiring more judgment in estimating the mid market price of such derivatives 
derivatives classified as level include first to default credit basket swaps  look back equity options and other structured products 
these derivatives are valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets 
otc derivatives classified within level are validated through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker dealer values 
the fair values of otc derivative assets and liabilities classified as level totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  and billion and million  respectively  as of december   without giving consideration to the impact of netting 
for additional information regarding embedded derivatives in our annuity and retirement products classified as level  see variable annuity optional living benefit features below 
all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of dealer and non dealer related derivatives  with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations  are recorded in current earnings 
generally  the changes in fair value of non dealer related derivatives  excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in realized investment gains losses  net

table of contents variable annuity optional living benefit features our liability for future policy benefits includes general account liabilities for guarantees on variable annuity contracts  including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits gmiwb 
while these guarantees primarily relate to the optional living benefit features of our individual annuities segment  they are also included in certain variable annuities in our international insurance segment and certain retirement account based group variable annuities in our retirement segment 
these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in realized investment gains losses  net 
the fair values of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations  the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques 
the significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features are primarily unobservable  therefore the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
we are required to incorporate our own risk of non performance in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features 
since insurance liabilities are senior to debt  we believe that reflecting the claims paying ratings of our insurance subsidiaries in the valuation of the liability appropriately takes into consideration our own risk of non performance 
to reflect the market s perception of our own risk of non performance  we incorporate an additional spread over libor into the discount rate used in the valuations of the embedded derivative liabilities 
the additional spread over libor rates incorporated into the discount rate as of december  generally ranged from to basis points for the portion of the interest rate curve most relevant to these liabilities 
for  our adjustment for the market s perception of our non performance risk resulted in a million pre tax benefit to our individual annuities segment  reflecting the additional spread over libor we incorporated into the discount rate used in the valuations of the embedded derivative liabilities beginning in the first quarter of to reflect changes in the market s perception of our non performance risk 
in addition  includes charges of million in our individual annuities segment related to an update of the actuarial and capital markets assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives 
these charges were primarily driven by a reduction in the expected lapse rate assumption based on actual experience  partially offset by a further update to our market volatility assumptions to reflect the inclusion of new market inputs  as well as updated assumptions for other actuarial and capital markets inputs 
our market volatility assumptions are no longer based solely on the implied volatility of over the counter equity options  but consider an index that is based both on implied and historical market volatilities 
the change in fair value of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb resulted in a decrease in the total liability of  million for  primarily reflecting a decrease in future expected benefit payments  resulting from an increase in policyholder account balance due to equity market appreciation  an increase in libor interest rates used in the discount rate  and the update of our market perceived non performance risk assumption discussed above 
these changes were significantly offset by increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and changes in value of related hedging instruments  primarily in our individual annuities segment as described in more detail under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the sale of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments  as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments 

table of contents realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities  recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities  provisions for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans  fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value  and fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  except those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer

for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments  see general account investments equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities below 
the level of other than temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is generally expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
historically  the causes of other than temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region 
however  as discussed in more detail below  certain of the other than temporary impairments recognized for the years ended december   and relate to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and reflect the overall deterioration of the housing market 
we may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
in light of unprecedented market conditions  and in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy of certain portfolios 
in the second quarter of  we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios 
other than temporary impairments  interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors are excluded from adjusted operating income 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
we also use equity based derivatives to hedge the equity risks embedded in some of our annuity products 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains losses  net  other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors  and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings  current period yield adjustments  or product derivatives and the effect of any related economic hedging program and related charges and adjustments

table of contents liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our brokerage  trading and banking operations  real estate and relocation services  and assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints  and for certain portfolios  maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of their major products 
our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the financial services businesses include the investment of proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  and operating cash flows  into optimally yielding investments  and where appropriate  the sale of the portfolio s lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s duration  credit  currency and other risk constraints  all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 
in light of the current market and economic conditions  while we continue to look to maximize book yield and match the liability characteristics of our major products  our portfolio management approach now reflects a greater consideration of the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity  as well as our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery  and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery 
in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy previously employed in the closed block business and certain portfolios of the financial services businesses 
starting in the second quarter of  we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios  and continue to evaluate trading strategies for these portfolios 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments  including our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery  see fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities and equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities  below 
management of investments we design asset mix strategies along with significant derivative strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management  strategic and tactical asset allocations and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework 
derivative strategies are employed within our risk management framework to help manage duration gaps and other risks between assets and liabilities 
for certain of our businesses  in recent years the use of interest rate swaps to increase the duration of the investment portfolio has increased as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of derivatives has declined 
within these businesses  the investment portfolio duration has generally declined relative to the liabilities as a result of purchases of fixed income securities with shorter duration than the duration of the liabilities we have issued and holding higher overall levels of short term investments and cash to provide additional liquidity in response to changing cash needs 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments  and other than trading activities insurance and annuity products asset liability management 

table of contents our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those managed by our international insurance segment  under the direction and oversight of the asset liability management and risk management groups 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally  within enterprise risk constraints  in some cases using the international and domestic asset management capabilities of our international investments or asset management segments 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions periodically 
our asset liability management and risk management groups develop the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries  oversee the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the asset liability management and risk management groups work closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes and to develop investment objectives  including performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment 
the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor

the decrease in yield on the japanese insurance portfolio for compared to is primarily attributable to lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates  including the reinvestment of proceeds realized from certain capital actions and a lower short term interest rate environment both in the us and japan 
the us dollar denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable japanese fixed maturities

fixed maturity securities investment mix our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of publicly traded and privately placed debt securities across an array of industry categories 
the fixed maturity securities relating to our international insurance operations are primarily comprised of foreign government securities 
we manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the asset liability management and risk management groups and  in the case of our international insurance portfolios  to a profile that also 
table of contents reflects the local market environment 
the investment objectives for fixed maturity securities are consistent with those described above 
the total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments 
we use our private placement and asset backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio 
within our domestic portfolios  we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings 
over the last several years  our investment staff has directly originated more than half of our annual private placement originations 
our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms  including covenants and call protection  and to take advantage of innovative deal structures

commercial mortgage backed securities weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  along with an overall decrease in liquidity and availability of capital have led to a very difficult refinancing environment and an increase in the overall delinquency rate on commercial mortgages in the commercial mortgage backed securities market 
difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the overall economic downturn continue to put additional pressure on these fundamentals through rising vacancies  falling rents and falling property values 
in addition  we have observed several market factors related to commercial mortgage backed securities issued in and  including less stringent underwriting  higher levels of leverage and collateral valuations that are generally no longer realizable 
to ensure our investment objectives and asset strategies are maintained  we consider these market factors in making our investment decisions on securities in these vintages

table of contents non us commercial mortgage backed securities subordination percentages by rating and vintage financial services businesses vintage december  lowest rating agency rating aaa aa a bbb bb and below prior the super senior structure was introduced to the us commercial mortgage backed securities market in late and was modified in early to increase subordination from to 
with the changes to the commercial mortgage backed securities structure in  there became three distinct aaa classes for commercial mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms  super senior aaa with subordination  mezzanine aaa with subordination and junior aaa with approximately subordination 
the super senior class has priority over the mezzanine and junior classes to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments and recoveries on defaulted loans 
as a result  all super senior bonds must be completely repaid before the mezzanine or junior bonds receive any principal cash flows 
in addition  the super senior bonds will not experience any loss of principal until both the entire mezzanine and junior bonds are written down to zero 
we believe the importance of this additional credit enhancement afforded to the super senior class over the mezzanine and junior classes is limited in a benign commercial real estate cycle with low defaults but becomes more significant in a deep commercial real estate downturn under which expected losses increase substantially 
in addition to enhanced subordination  certain securities within the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows 
the super senior class is generally structured such that shorter duration time tranches have priority over longer duration time tranches as to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments  and recoveries on defaulted loans until the deal reaches cumulative net loss  at which point all super senior securities are paid pro rata 
as a result  short of reaching cumulative net losses  the shorter duration super senior tranches must be completely repaid before the longest duration super senior tranche receives any principal cash flows 
we have generally focused our purchases of recent vintage commercial mortgage backed securities on shorter duration super senior tranches that we believe have sufficient priority to ensure that in most scenarios our positions will be fully repaid prior to the structure reaching the cumulative net loss threshold

in general  naic designations of highest quality  or high quality  include fixed maturities considered investment grade  which include securities rated baa or higher by moody s or bbb or higher by standard poor s 
naic designations of through generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade  which include securities rated ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by standard poor s 
however  in the fourth quarter of the naic adopted rules which temporarily changed the methodology for determining the naic designations for non agency residential mortgage backed securities  including our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
under the new rules  rather than being based on the rating of a third party rating agency  as of december  the naic designations for such securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party engaged by the naic and the statutory carrying value of the security  including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized 
these rules are expected to be in place until a long term solution for evaluating these securities is determined 
as a result of time lags between the funding of investments  the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the svo filing process  the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the svo as of each balance sheet date 
pending receipt of svo ratings  the categorization of these securities by naic designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis

in a credit derivative we sell credit protection on an identified name  or a basket of names in a first to default structure  and in return receive a quarterly premium 
with single name credit default derivatives  this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates  at the time the agreement is executed 
with first to default baskets  because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named credits  the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket 
if there is an event of default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket  as defined by the agreement  then we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced defaulted security or similar security 
subsequent defaults on the remaining names within such instruments require no further payment to counterparties 
the majority of referenced names in the credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection  as well as all the counterparties to these agreements  are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less 
credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value  including the premium received  recorded in realized investment gains losses  net

see other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
for private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 

table of contents fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer  and the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines  declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value greater than  maintained for more than one year on below investment grade bonds  and declines in value less than six months where there has been a precipitous generally or greater decline in value 
given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  and the resulting historically wide bid ask spreads and high levels of price volatility  the extent and duration of a decline in value have become less indicative of when the market may believe there has been credit deterioration with respect to an issuer 
considering these current conditions  beginning in the third quarter of our determinations of whether a decline in value is other than temporary have placed greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value 
our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment 
we continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases 
in addition  effective with our adoption on january  of new authoritative guidance related to debt securities we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when either a we have the intent to sell the debt security or b it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
for all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet either of these two criteria  we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security 
if the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment  an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
the determination of the assumptions used in these projections requires the use of significant management judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other than temporary impairments for debt securities

all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending 
uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance

composition of commercial mortgage loans the global financial markets have experienced extreme stress since the second half of the availability and cost of credit has been materially affected  leading to a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market  and in particular a decrease in activity by securitization lenders 
these conditions have led to greater opportunities for more selective originations by portfolio lenders such as our general account 
while we have observed weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals  delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans have been relatively stable in recent years 
however  continued difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the overall economic downturn has put additional pressure on these fundamentals through rising vacancies  falling rents and falling property values  resulting in potentially higher levels of loan losses 
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a smaller loan to value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments 
a larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments 
as of december   our general account investments in commercial mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times  and a weighted average loan to value ratio of 
as of december   approximately of commercial mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses were fixed rate loans

for those general account commercial mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses that were originated in  the weighted average loan to value ratio was  and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was times 
the values utilized in calculating these loan to value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio  which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value 
our periodic review also includes a quality re rating process  whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above 
as discussed below  the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for loan losses 
for loans with collateral under construction  renovation or lease up  a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan to value and debt service coverage ratios 
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the financial services businesses included approximately billion and billion of such loans as of december  and december   respectively  and our commercial mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the closed block business included approximately billion and billion of such loans as of december  and december   respectively 
all else being equal  these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized 
as of december  there are million and million of loan specific reserves related to these loans in the financial services businesses and closed block business  respectively

we place loans on early warning status in cases where  based on our analysis of the loan s collateral  the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors  we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur 
we classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
as described below  in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans 
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process 
the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be non performing as a result of our loan review process  and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list 
we define a non performing loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for a non performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above  as well as property type diversification  our past loan experience and other relevant factors 
together with historical credit migration and default statistics  the internal quality ratings are used to determine a default probability by loan 
historical loss severity statistics by property type are then applied to arrive at an estimate for incurred but not specifically identified losses 
historical credit migration  default and loss severity statistics are updated each quarter based on our actual loan experience  and are considered together with other relevant qualitative factors in making the final portfolio reserve calculations 
the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors

since we apply to these securities an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities  we have not recognized an other than temporary impairment on certain of these perpetual preferred securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more as of december  we have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other than temporary impairments 
see other than temporary impairments of equity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 

table of contents other than temporary impairments of equity securities for those equity securities classified as available for sale we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value 
all securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value maintained for one year or greater  and declines in value greater than  the reasons for the decline in value issuer specific event  currency or market fluctuation  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
given recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  and the resulting high levels of price volatility  beginning in the third quarter of we extended the parameters under which we consider a decline in value to be other than temporary 
in particular  we generally recognize other than temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater 
in addition  in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including an assessment of the issuer s capital position  and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary  we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
once identified  these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
for perpetual preferred securities  which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities  we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities  factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and the lack of a formal maturity date 
for additional discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities  see fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities above 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a writedown to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis and is included in realized investment gains losses

liquidity and capital resources overview the disruptions in the capital markets that began in the second half of  initially due to concerns over sub prime mortgage holdings of financial institutions  accelerated to unprecedented levels in the latter half of and continued into  resulting in failure  consolidation  or us federal government intervention on behalf of several significant financial institutions 
these disruptions resulted in significant market volatility and adversely impacted the availability and cost of credit and capital 
however  certain markets have shown marked improvement since mid equity markets have appreciated  with less volatility  and bond spreads have tightened significantly 
we took advantage of these improved market conditions and raised approximately billion in the capital markets in in june  we sold  shares of prudential financial common stock in a public offering  
table of contents at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of billion and we announced at that time that we would not participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
in june and september  we sold an aggregate of billion of prudential financial medium term notes 
in september  we issued million of prudential insurance surplus notes that are exchangeable for prudential financial common stock 
these financing transactions allowed us to preserve our financial flexibility by conserving internal resources and paying down a portion of our commercial paper borrowings 
in january  we issued an additional billion of prudential financial medium term notes 
on december   we received billion of proceeds in cash from wells fargo upon the completion of the sale of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities 
the proceeds are being held in cash and short term investments until such time as the proceeds  net of taxes  are invested longer term 
in addition  we received million in payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million that had been issued by wachovia securities in connection with the establishment of the joint venture 
also  in june  we repurchased billion of the floating rate convertible senior notes that we issued in  at par plus accrued interest  as required by the holders under the terms of the notes  using existing cash and short term investments 
as the dislocation in the markets continued  we took certain other actions during to strengthen our liquidity and capital position  including the following made capital contributions and capital loans to our international insurance operations in japan totaling million  borrowed billion from the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny  in the form of collateralized funding agreements  to replace funding agreements between prudential financial and prudential insurance  thereby converting retail medium term note issuances to general corporate debt  significantly reduced our reliance on commercial paper  sold assets held by some of our affiliates to reduce their borrowing needs  monetized gains from certain derivative positions  including those related to the us dollar denominated products co insured from our japanese insurance operations  completed internal asset sales  and repaid affiliate surplus notes 
while the above actions have strengthened our liquidity and capital position  certain of them  as well as our decision to maintain higher levels of cash and short term investments than in prior periods  have had a negative impact on current earnings 
the company continues to operate with significant cash and short term investments on the balance sheet and has access to alternate sources of liquidity  as described below 
however  should the recent improvements in the capital markets prove temporary and the severity of prior markets return  such market disruptions could potentially adversely affect prudential financial s and its subsidiaries ability to access sources of liquidity  as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives 
we may take additional actions beyond those described above  especially in the event of such disruptions  which may include but are not limited to further access external sources of capital  including the debt or equity markets  reduce or eliminate future shareholder dividends on prudential financial common stock  utilize further proceeds from our outstanding retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes by accelerating repayments of additional funding agreements from prudential insurance  undertake additional capital management activities  including reinsurance transactions  transfer ownership of certain subsidiaries of prudential financial to prudential insurance  take additional actions related to derivatives  limit or curtail sales of certain products and or restructure existing products  undertake further asset sales or internal asset transfers  and seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules 
certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and or agreement of counterparties  which are outside of our control  or have economic costs associated with them 
in the event that market conditions were to deteriorate  we may also be required to make further capital contributions to our regulated domestic or international subsidiaries 
management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi year time horizon through our quarterly planning process 
we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds presently available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries  including reasonably foreseeable contingencies

prudential financial is a holding company whose principal assets are its investments in subsidiaries 
we believe prudential financial s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with its ratings targets 
our long term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are a for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  and a for am best company  or am best 
our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best 
for our current ratings some of which are below these targets  a description of material rating actions that occurred in  and a discussion of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades  see ratings 
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets 
the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension and postretirement benefits  outstanding junior subordinated debt and outstanding capital debt of the financial services businesses  as discussed below under financing activities 
based on these components  the capital position of the financial services businesses as of december  was as follows december  in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension postretirement benefits junior subordinated debt hybrid securities capital debt total capital our capital debt to total capital ratio was as of december  for the purpose of calculating this ratio  of the hybrid securities are attributed equity credit  with the remaining treated as capital debt 
as shown in the table above  as of december   the financial services businesses had billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessments of these businesses and operations  we believe this level of capital was consistent with the aa ratings targets of our regulated operating entities as of december  in october  in response to the severe dislocation affecting the financial markets  the us treasury launched the tarp capital purchase program which involved the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the us treasury 
we applied in october to participate in the tarp capital purchase program and on may   we received preliminary approval from the us treasury to participate in the program 
however  on june   we announced that we would not participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
in addition to the foregoing  the us federal government  as well as foreign governments and central banks  have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the recent financial market dislocation  which could include increased regulation of financial services and financial institutions 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether these actions will be adopted or the effect they may have on the financial markets  or on our businesses  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition

restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or distributions paid by 
table of contents prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was billion and billion  respectively  and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of million and million  respectively 
prudential insurance must also notify the new jersey department of banking and insurance of its intent to pay a dividend or distribution 
if the dividend or distribution  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds a specified statutory limit it is considered an extraordinary dividend or distribution and prudential insurance must obtain the prior non disapproval of the department 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers is generally the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus  which surplus was billion as of december   or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses  which was billion for the year ended december  prudential insurance and our other insurance subsidiaries may also be subject to additional company specific regulatory limitations and adjustments 
in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances 
although prudential insurance had the capacity under the regulatory requirements to pay dividends to its parent in  it did not declare or pay any dividends to its parent 
the payment of dividends by prudential insurance to its parent in will depend on market conditions and other factors 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain other restrictions that preclude gibraltar life from paying dividends to prudential financial in the near term 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar life to pay such dividends 
there are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the prudential life insurance company  ltd  or prudential of japan  which began paying dividends in further  deterioration in market conditions could adversely impact the capital positions of our international insurance companies  which could further restrict their ability to pay dividends 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries  and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries  to pay dividends is largely unrestricted 
see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries below for additional details on the liquidity of our domestic insurance subsidiaries  international insurance subsidiaries and asset management subsidiaries 
alternative sources of liquidity prudential financial maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis 
depending on the overall availability of cash  the parent holding company invests excess cash on a short term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets 
additional longer term liquidity is available through inter affiliate borrowing arrangements 
prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities  as discussed under lines of credit and other credit facilities  as well as the other alternative sources of liquidity described below 
commercial paper programs prudential financial has a commercial paper program currently rated a by s p  p by moody s and f by fitch with an authorized capacity of billion 
prudential financial commercial paper borrowings have been generally used to fund the working capital needs of prudential financial s subsidiaries and provide short term liquidity at prudential financial 
prudential financial s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were million as of december   with a weighted average maturity of days  of which was overnight 
this represents a decrease of billion from december   largely due to the repayment of maturing commercial paper issued under the cpff program described below and a reduction in the commercial paper supporting excess cash held at prudential financial 
the daily average commercial paper outstanding during under this program was million 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  has a commercial paper program currently rated a by s p  p by moody s and f by fitch with a current authorized capacity of billion 
prudential funding s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were million as of december   with a weighted average maturity of days  of which was overnight 
this represents a decrease of billion from december   largely due to the elimination of investments in our enhanced short term portfolio and repayment of loans by our affiliates funded through a combination of asset sales  substitute funding from prudential financial from the proceeds of medium term notes and other internal sources of cash 
as of december   the majority of the proceeds from outstanding commercial paper were held in cash and cash equivalents  while the remainder was primarily utilized to fund the working capital needs of our affiliates and short term cash flow timing mismatches 
the daily average commercial paper outstanding during under this program was billion 
the weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
prudential financial has issued a subordinated guarantee covering prudential funding s domestic commercial paper program 
both prudential financial s and prudential funding s commercial paper programs were granted approval during the fourth quarter of to participate in the commercial paper funding facility  or cpff  sponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york 
commercial paper programs were required to maintain ratings of at least a p f by at least two rating agencies in order to be eligible for the cpff 
prudential financial became ineligible to participate in the cpff due to a commercial paper credit rating downgrade in february access to the cpff for all issuers was terminated by the federal reserve on february  as of december   neither prudential financial nor prudential funding had any commercial paper outstanding under the cpff 
we continue to see improvements in the capital markets  including increased demand in the short term markets 
as a result  we have seen the credit markets begin to function in a more normalized fashion 
however  rating agency actions in impacted our commercial paper programs 
while the financing cost of prudential financial s commercial paper remained elevated versus its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate  this spread tightened significantly over the course of the year as investor demand for credit products increased 
the financing cost of prudential funding s commercial paper remained elevated versus its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate over the same period as a result of its commercial paper rating being placed on negative watch and eventually being downgraded by moody s 
although we have experienced a reduction in investor demand for prudential funding s commercial paper versus historical levels  we have recently seen significant investor demand and spread compression as a split rated program 
while we consider the availability of low cost and efficient financing that commercial paper provides as one of our alternative sources of liquidity  we have significantly reduced our reliance on commercial paper to fund our operations  and have developed plans which would enable us to further reduce  or if necessary eliminate  our borrowings under the prudential financial and prudential funding commercial paper programs through the use of other sources of liquidity 
both commercial paper programs are backed by our unsecured committed lines of credit 
as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  for a further discussion of lines of credit  see lines of credit and other credit facilities 
asset based financing we conduct asset based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries  including transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements  in order to earn spread income  to borrow funds  or to facilitate trading activity 
these programs are driven by portfolio holdings in securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace 
the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short term spread portfolios of our domestic insurance entities 
investments held in the short term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and fixed maturities  including mortgage and asset backed securities  with a 
table of contents weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less 
a portion of the asset backed securities held in our short term spread portfolios  including our enhanced short term portfolio  are collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short term spread portfolio 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities for a further discussion of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime holdings  including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short term portfolio 
these short term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements  which among other things  do not allow for significant asset liability interest rate duration mismatch 
as of december   our financial services businesses had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase  billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities and million representing securities sold but not yet purchased 
of the billion for the financial services businesses as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from days to months with a weighted average maturity of days 
as of december   our financial services businesses had liabilities totaling billion under such programs 
as of december   our closed block business had liabilities totaling billion under such programs  including billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million representing cash collateral for loaned securities 
of the billion for the closed block business as of december   billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral  and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from days to months with a weighted average maturity of days 
as of december   our closed block business had liabilities totaling billion under such programs 
as of december   our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the lending program of billion  of which billion were on loan 
taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december   we believe approximately billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable  of which approximately billion relates to the financial services business  however  these amounts are subject to potential regulatory constraints 
further changes in market conditions can affect the ability to lend the available assets 
as referenced above  these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates 
as such  we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs 
holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available financing 
current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds  investment spreads  asset liability duration matching and liquidity 
federal home loan bank of new york prudential insurance has been a member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny  since june membership allows prudential insurance to participate in fhlbny s product line of financial services  including collateralized advances  collateralized funding agreements and general asset liability management that can be used for liquidity management and as an alternative source of funding 
our membership in fhlbny requires us to maintain ownership of member stock and borrowings from fhlbny require us to purchase fhlbny activity based stock in an amount equal to of outstanding borrowings 
under fhlbny guidelines  borrowings by its members are at the discretion of the fhlbny 
the fhlbny requires prudential insurance to pledge qualifying mortgage related assets or us treasury securities as collateral for all borrowings 
in may  the new jersey department of banking and insurance  or njdobi  revised its prior guidance to increase the maximum amount of qualifying assets that prudential insurance may pledge as collateral to the fhlbny from to of its prior year end statutory net admitted assets exclusive of separate account assets  however  this limitation resets to on december  unless extended by njdobi 
based on its statutory net admitted assets as of december   the limitation 
table of contents equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity  after taking into account applicable required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity based fhlbny stock  of approximately billion 
however  the ability to borrow from the fhlbny is subject to the availability and maintenance of qualifying assets at prudential insurance  and there is no assurance that prudential insurance will have sufficient qualifying assets available to it in order to access the increased capacity in full at any particular time 
also  the revised guidance from njdobi limits the aggregate amount of assets prudential insurance may pledge for all loans  including borrowings from the fhlbny  to of its prior year end statutory net admitted assets exclusive of separate account assets  however  this limitation excludes certain activities  such as the asset based financing transactions described above 
the fair value of the qualifying assets pledged as collateral by prudential insurance must be maintained at certain specified levels of the borrowed amount  which can vary  depending on the nature of the assets pledged 
if the fair value of the collateral declines below these levels or if assets previously pledged cease to qualify under fhlbny guidelines such as due to ratings downgrades on mortgage backed securities  prudential insurance could be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings 
if at the time of a proposed borrowing  or at a time when required to pledge additional collateral in respect of outstanding borrowings  prudential insurance had insufficient qualifying assets  it would need to obtain and pledge additional mortgage related assets and or treasury securities through asset purchases  reacquiring assets on loan or otherwise  subject to availability on appropriate terms 
as of december   we had pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of billion  which supported outstanding borrowings in the form of collateralized advances and collateralized funding agreements of billion 
the fair value of qualifying assets that were available but not pledged amounted to billion as of december  in february and march  prudential insurance issued collateralized funding agreements in an aggregate amount of billion to the fhlbny 
the funding agreements  which are reflected in policyholders account balances  have priority claim status above debt holders of prudential insurance 
these funding agreements currently serve as a substitute funding source for a product of our retirement segment  which earns investment spread that was previously funded by retail medium term notes issued by prudential financial 
this substitution allows prudential financial to use the proceeds from the sale of the corresponding retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes 
to effect the substitution  during the first and second quarters of  billion and million  respectively  of intercompany funding agreements that were previously issued by prudential insurance to prudential financial were terminated for payments of million and million  respectively  from prudential insurance to prudential financial 
these payments represent the fair value of the funding agreements on the date of termination 
we may conduct similar transactions  or take other actions  in future periods in order to utilize additional retail medium term notes proceeds for general corporate purposes 
in addition  as of december   billion of the fhlbny advances outstanding are reflected in short term debt with billion maturing on june  and billion maturing on december  as of december   proceeds from these advances of million were invested in cash and short term investments at prudential insurance  billion were used to support the operating needs of our businesses  million were used as a replacement source of funding for a portion of capital requirements of gibraltar life  previously funded through foreign currency denominated unsecured bridge loan facilities  and the balance was used to purchase investments  including the requisite fhlbny activity based stock 
prudential insurance may  from time to time  borrow additional funds from fhlbny for purposes of managing liquidity  making operating loans to affiliates  facilitating asset liability management  or issuing funding agreements 
under fhlbny guidelines  if prudential insurance s claims paying ratings decline below certain levels  and the fhlbny does not receive written assurances from njdobi regarding prudential insurance s solvency  new borrowings from the fhlbny would be limited to a term of days or less 
because prudential insurance s rating from one rating agency is at the required minimum level and its other ratings are above the required minimum level  currently there is no restriction on the term of borrowings from the fhlbny 
federal home loan bank of boston prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  or priac  became a member of the federal home loan bank of boston  or fhlbb  in december membership allows priac access to collateralized 
table of contents advances which will be classified in short term debt or long term debt  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
priac s membership in fhlbb requires the ownership of member stock and borrowings from fhlbb require the purchase of fhlbb activity based stock in an amount between and of outstanding borrowings  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
as of december   priac had no advances outstanding under the fhlbb facility 
the connecticut department of insurance  or ctdoi  granted priac consent to pledge up to billion in qualifying assets to secure borrowing through december  and recently granted an extension through december  priac must seek re approval from ctdoi prior to borrowing additional funds after december  based on eligible assets as of december   priac had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity  after taking into consideration required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity based fhlbb stock  of approximately billion 
management of capital in addition to selectively using an economic capital framework for making certain business decisions  we are in the process of refining our current capital management framework 
these enhancements to the current framework  which is primarily based on statutory risk based capital measures  are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses 
liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support 
the results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments 
we have received a request pursuant to the documentation for the disposition of our property and casualty operations completed in to deposit into a trust cash or securities for the purpose of securing insurance liabilities that were to have been transferred to prudential insurance following completion of the disposition but that have not been so transferred 
we estimate that the amount of cash or securities to be deposited is approximately million  and we are allowed to satisfy a portion of this requirement through the deposit of promissory notes received from the purchaser at the time of the disposition 
we believe that the deposit of these assets would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations  as well as internal and external borrowings 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 

table of contents we believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels  policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  and the relative safety of competing products including those with enhancements under government sponsored programs  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
in addition  market volatility can impact the level of capital required to support our businesses  particularly in our annuity business 
our domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  commitments to invest and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates  due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of recent market declines 
annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities 
as of december  and  our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of billion and billion  respectively  which includes a portion financed with asset based financing 
the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements  including under foreseeable stress scenarios 

table of contents given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized investment gains or losses  see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
instead of selling investments at depressed market prices externally  in order to preserve economic value including tax attributes  we may also sell investments from one subsidiary to another at fair market value or transfer investments internally between businesses within the same subsidiary 
prudential funding  llc prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  serves as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of prudential insurance and its subsidiaries 
prudential funding also lends to other subsidiaries of prudential financial up to limits established with the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
to the extent that other subsidiaries of prudential financial have financing needs in excess of these limits  these needs are met through financing from prudential financial directly or from third parties 
prudential funding operates under a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth at all times 
prudential financial has also issued a subordinated guarantee covering prudential funding s domestic commercial paper program 
prudential funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper 
prudential funding s outstanding commercial paper  including master note borrowings  were million as of december  and billion as of december   and are more fully discussed above under alternative sources of liquidity 
the impact of prudential funding s financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations 
the total principal amount of debt outstanding under prudential funding s domestic medium term note programs was million as of both december  and the weighted average interest rates on prudential funding s long term debt  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s rbc ratio to a level consistent with a aa ratings target 
rbc is determined by statutory guidelines and formulas that consider  among other things  risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capitalization 
as of december   rbc for prudential insurance was approximately  which exceeded the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations 
in addition  all of our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries have rbc ratios that exceed the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations 
the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing  advertising or promotional activities 

table of contents the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations  changes in the values of derivatives  the level of impairments recorded  credit quality migration of the investment portfolio  among other items 
further  the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by  or credit quality migration affecting  the reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels 
the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries is also affected by statutory accounting rules  which are subject to change by insurance regulators 
the implementation of vacarvm  a new statutory reserve methodology for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits  effective december  did not have a material impact on the statutory surplus of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate 
however  vacarvm resulted in higher statutory reserves ceded to our offshore captive reinsurance company  which increased statutory reserve credit requirements by approximately million from the levels at december  in  we satisfied the reinsurance reserve credit requirement through a combination of funding statutory reserve credit trusts with available cash of the captive reinsurer and proceeds from an inter company loan to the captive reinsurer from prudential insurance 
prudential securities group as a result of the negative impact of market dislocations on capital levels within prudential insurance experienced during  we contributed prudential securities group  llc to prudential insurance to strengthen capital during the fourth quarter of this contribution increased prudential insurance s net admitted assets by billion 
prudential securities group owned our investment in the wachovia securities joint venture until its sale on december  and continues to own other wholly owned businesses  principally our global commodities group 
distributions from the wachovia securities joint venture to prudential securities group totaled million and million for and  respectively 
on december   we completed the sale of our minority joint venture interest in wachovia securities  which includes wells fargo advisors  to wells fargo 
at the closing  we received billion in cash as the purchase price of our joint venture interest and de recognized the carrying value of our investment in the joint venture and the carrying value of the lookback option 
for the year ended december   equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  net of taxes in our consolidated statements of operations includes the associated pre tax gain on the sale of billion 
the proceeds from the sale are being held in cash and short term investments  reflected in our corporate and other operations  until such time as the proceeds  net of taxes  are invested longer term 
in addition  following the closing  we received million in payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million that had been issued by wachovia securities in connection with the establishment of the joint venture 
for more information on our former investment in the wachovia securities joint venture  including the lookback option  see note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as divested businesses financial advisory 
the other wholly owned businesses in prudential securities group  principally our global commodities group  continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets  consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents  segregated client assets  and short term receivables from clients  broker dealers  and exchanges 
as registered broker dealers and members of various self regulatory organizations  our us registered broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the sec s uniform net capital rule  as well as the net capital requirements of the commodity futures trading commission and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members 
compliance with these capital requirements could limit the ability of these operations to pay dividends 
international insurance and investments subsidiaries in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity  and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries 
we monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures  taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 

table of contents as with our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
as of december  and  our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of billion and billion  respectively 
of those amounts  billion and billion  respectively  were associated with gibraltar life 
concurrent with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges  which were initially  have gradually declined each year and expired in april we did not experience any material increases in the level of surrenders due to the expiration of these surrender charges 
policies issued by gibraltar life post acquisition are generally subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value  less applicable surrender charges  which currently start at or more 
a special dividend is payable to certain gibraltar life policyholders based on of the net increase in the fair value  through march  of certain real estate and loans  net of transaction costs and taxes  included in the gibraltar life reorganization plan 
the first special dividend was paid in and the final special dividend is payable generally on the next anniversary of the issue date of each applicable insurance policy  beginning in april during the year ended december   gibraltar made distributions to policyholders of million in payment of the special dividend  primarily in the form of additional policy values  and to a lesser extent in cash 
as of december   the remaining liability of million related to the special dividend is included in policyholders dividends and will be paid upon the applicable policy anniversary dates throughout the first and second quarter of gibraltar life s investment portfolio continues to be structured to provide adequate liquidity for payment of the special dividend 
on may   our gibraltar life operations acquired yamato life  a japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in october gibraltar life served as the reorganization sponsor for yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired yamato by contributing million of capital to yamato 
concurrent with our acquisition  substantially all of yamato s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges are in the first year and will decline by each year thereafter 
subsequent to the acquisition  we renamed the acquired company prudential financial of japan life insurance company ltd 
the prudential life insurance company  ltd  or prudential of japan  had billion and billion of general account insurance related liabilities  other than dividends to policyholders  as of december  and  respectively 
prudential of japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  or additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
as of december  and  our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of billion and billion  respectively  and fixed maturity investments  other than those designated as held to maturity  with fair values of billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating  of which billion  or  were invested in government or government agency bonds 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
of those amounts  billion of the high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rated fixed maturity investments and billion of the other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rated fixed maturity investments were associated with gibraltar life 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations liquidity under stress scenarios 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 

table of contents similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by us insurance regulators  regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies 
all of our international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities 
these solvency margins are also a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations 
we manage these solvency margins to a capitalization level consistent with our aa ratings target 
during the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  market conditions negatively impacted the level of capital in our international life insurance subsidiaries  particularly in japan 
to maintain our solvency ratios at or above the desired target level  we made capital contributions and capital loans of million to our japan life insurance subsidiaries during the first quarter of maintenance of our solvency ratios at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning  as in certain jurisdictions  such as japan  these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength 
we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements  including the strategies discussed in results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance and investments division 
these hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs 
the internal hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities and serve to hedge the value of us dollar denominated investments held on the books of these yen based entities 
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and these yen based subsidiaries 
the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial funded million of cash settlements related to the internal hedge program  which were paid to the yen based subsidiaries 
as of december  the market value of the internal hedges was a liability of million owed to the yen based subsidiaries of prudential financial 
absent any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of december   the million internal hedge liability represents the present value of the net cash flows from prudential financial to these entities over the life of the hedging instruments  up to years 
a significant yen appreciation over an extended period of time would result in higher net cash outflows from prudential financial in excess of our historical experience 
our external hedges serve to hedge the equity investments in certain subsidiaries and future income of most foreign subsidiaries 
the external hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and external parties 
cash settlements on these activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and the external parties and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during  prudential financial paid million of net cash flows for external hedge settlements 
as of december   the net liability related to external foreign currency hedges was million 
a significant appreciation in yen and other foreign currencies could result in net cash outflows in excess of our liability 
during the second quarter of  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of our korean operations due to a variety of considerations  including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from a strengthening korean won 
in our international investments operations  liquidity is provided through asset management fees as well as commission revenue 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses  and distributions of dividends and returns of capital 
as with our domestic operations  the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe cash flows from our international investments subsidiaries are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
asset management subsidiaries our asset management businesses  which include real estate  public and private fixed income and public equity asset management  as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing  and retail investment products  such as mutual funds and other retail services  are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends 
table of contents and distributions 
our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make  and the fee based asset management business can provide a relatively stable source of cash flow to prudential financial 
the principal sources of liquidity for our fee based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
the principal sources of liquidity for our proprietary investments and interim loans are cash flows from investments  the ability to liquidate investments  and available borrowing lines from internal sources  including prudential funding and prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner  declines in the value of assets and credit defaults 
the current adverse market conditions have increased the liquidity risks associated with our proprietary investments and interim loans  as the markets for certain investments  such as commercial mortgages and real estate  have become less liquid 
if we needed to sell these investments  we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize 
in december  we received approval from njdobi for prudential insurance to provide an month billion lending facility to our commercial mortgage operation that is collateralized primarily by its interim loan portfolio 
as of december   we were in compliance with the loan to value covenant of the facility 
however  there is a risk that further deterioration in the collateral pledged under the facility could require posting of additional collateral or a partial pay down of the facility to bring the facility into compliance with its covenants 
as of december   billion was outstanding under this facility 
in april  our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business received approval to participate in a fannie mae alternative delivery program known as asap plus as soon as pooled delivery 
our approval limit for outstanding balances on asap plus is presently million 
this program allows us to assign a qualified fannie mae loan trade commitment to fannie mae as early as the next business day after a loan closes  and receive of the loan purchase price from fannie mae 
the program does not eliminate the need to provide temporary warehouse financing  but does significantly reduce the duration of funding requirements for eligible fannie mae originated loans from the normal delivery cycle of two to four weeks down to as little as one to two days 
during  in our proprietary investing business  we received repayments of real estate loans secured by equity commitments from investors and assets of funds managed by us  and we reduced exposure to certain public equity and real estate seed investments 
the proceeds of these activities  which totaled billion  were used to repay financing provided by prudential financial and prudential funding 
certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by prudential insurance 
in the normal course of business  these separate accounts enter into purchase commitments which include commitments to purchase real estate  invest in future real estate partnerships  and or fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously acquired real estate investments 
certain purchases of real estate are contingent on the developer s development of the real estate according to plans and specifications outlined in a pre sale agreement or the property achieving a certain level of leasing 
purchase commitments are typically entered into by prudential insurance on behalf of the particular separate account and  upon acquisition  are titled either in prudential insurance or an llc subsidiary formed for that purpose 
in certain cases  the commitments specify that recourse on the obligation is limited to the assets of the separate account 

table of contents at december  and  total outstanding purchase commitments were billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the repayment of commitment obligations by the separate accounts during the following is a summary of the outstanding purchase commitments for these separate account portfolios as of december  contractual maturity date separate account purchase commitments after total in millions recourse to prudential insurance recourse limited to assets of separate accounts total the contractual maturity dates of some of the outstanding purchase commitments may accelerate upon a failure to maintain required loan to value ratios  upon the downgrade of ratings applicable to the separate account funds or upon the failure to satisfy other financial covenants 
of the billion of total commitments reflected in the table above  billion represents off balance sheet commitments  of which billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
these separate accounts have also entered into syndicated credit facilities providing for borrowings in the aggregate amount of up to billion  of which billion was outstanding at december  these facilities also include loan to value ratio requirements and other financial covenants 
recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account 
as of december   these separate account portfolios had a combined gross and net asset value of billion and billion  respectively 
at the time of maturity of a commitment obligation  prudential insurance often endeavors to negotiate extensions  refinancings or other solutions with creditors 
management believes that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to ultimately meet their obligations 
however  because of the recent volatility and disruption in the credit and real estate capital markets  the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales  operating cash flow  deposits from clients  debt refinancings or from the above mentioned portfolio level credit facilities 
in cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations  prudential insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions 
prudential insurance did not provide any such funding in as of december  and  our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and billion  respectively  which include million and million of loans secured by investor equity commitments or fund assets  respectively 
the million as of december  reflects a decrease of million  of which million came primarily from paydowns and million came from the reclassification of certain secured loans to other long term investments due to the company s decision to extend the loans beyond their original maturity dates 
the extension of these loans primarily occurred in the third quarter of financing activities in march  prudential financial filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which permits the issuance of public debt  equity and hybrid securities 
as a well known seasoned issuer under sec rules  prudential financial s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing  pay as you go fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective amendments 
also  in accordance with these rules  the shelf registration statement has no stated issuance capacity 
in june  prudential financial issued  shares of its common stock which number includes the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share for gross proceeds of billion 
the net proceeds from this offering of billion were used for general corporate purposes  a portion of which is currently held in cash and cash equivalents at prudential financial

the weighted average interest rates on prudential financial s medium term and senior notes  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  on january   we issued million of notes due january and million of notes due january under the medium term notes  series d program 
proceeds from these issuances will be used to replace a portion of borrowings from the fhlbny which matures in june and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes 
in march  prudential financial filed an updated prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement for its retail medium term notes  including the internotes program 
the authorized issuance capacity under the current retail medium term notes program is billion  and as of december   approximately billion remained available under this program 
this retail medium term notes program has served as a 
table of contents funding source for a product of our retirement segment for which we earn investment spread that is economically similar to funding agreement backed medium term notes issued to institutional investors  except that the retail notes are senior unsecured obligations of prudential financial and are primarily purchased by retail investors 
however  beginning in the first quarter of  some of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium term notes are being used for general corporate purposes and funding agreements issued to the fhlbny are being used as a substitute funding source for the asset portfolio within the retirement segment  as discussed in more detail in prudential financial alternative sources of liquidity federal home loan bank of new york 
the weighted average interest rates on prudential financial s retail medium term notes were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
our retail medium term notes program has been negatively impacted by the disruptions in the credit markets 
the decline in demand for risk bearing investments among retail investors  and the related increase in funding costs  has resulted in a halt in new debt issuances under this program 
as the market dislocations abate and investor demand improves  we may resume issuances under the program 
in february  prudential financial repaid at maturity billion borrowed under unsecured bridge loan facilities provided by two institutions using internal sources of cash 
the net proceeds had been used to repay maturing debt that was issued concurrently with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  which served to fund capital requirements of gibraltar life 
this requirement is now funded through a combination of borrowings from the fhlbny  long term debt of prudential funding  and internal sources of cash 
in june and july  prudential financial issued million of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors and million of fixed rate junior subordinated notes to retail investors 
both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities  which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies 
both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of june  and a final maturity of june  in connection with the issuance of both series of notes  prudential financial entered into a replacement capital covenant  or rcc  for the benefit of holders of its senior notes due under the rcc  prudential financial agrees that it will not repay  redeem  defease  or purchase the notes prior to june   unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities  which include  but are not limited to  hybrid capital securities and common stock 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning these junior subordinated notes 
in december  prudential financial issued in a private placement billion of floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of prudential financial s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events 
the interest rate on these notes is month libor minus  with a minimum interest rate of 
holders of the notes may require prudential financial to repurchase the notes  at par plus accrued interest  on contractually specified dates 
on the first such date  june   billion of the notes were repurchased by prudential financial and on the next such date  december   million of the notes were repurchased 
the next date on which holders of these notes may require prudential financial to repurchase these notes is december  during the fourth quarter of and in  the company repurchased  in individually negotiated transactions  million and million  respectively  of these notes which were offered to the company by certain holders

the proceeds from the sale of these surplus notes are currently held in cash and cash equivalents and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes at prudential insurance 
total general debt obligations decreased by billion from december  to  primarily due to a reduction in short term debt 
the primary drivers of the reduction in short term debt were the reduction in outstanding prudential financial and prudential funding commercial paper  as further described in alternative sources of liquidity  the repayment of billion borrowed under unsecured bridge loan facilities described earlier  the repurchase of a substantial portion of our convertible senior notes and maturities of our medium term notes 
during  we purchased securities under the federal reserve s term asset backed securities loan facility  or talf

table of contents and provides financing for the purchase price of the securities  less a haircut that varies based on the type of collateral 
borrowers under the program can deliver the collateralized securities to a special purpose vehicle created by the federal reserve in full defeasance of the loan 
during  the company obtained billion of secured financing from the federal reserve under this program 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company sold a portion of the securities purchased under the program and used the proceeds to repay million and million of the borrowings  respectively 
as of december   million of securities purchased under talf are reflected within other trading account assets  and million of secured financing from the federal reserve related to the purchase of these securities are reflected within long term debt 
the company is carrying both the securities and the debt at fair value 
the naic has adopted a model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  and a supporting guideline entitled the application of the valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as guideline axxx 
the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees 
many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive  and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of regulation xxx and guideline axxx on our term and universal life insurance business  including actions that are described in more detail below 
during  a subsidiary of prudential insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to billion of ten year floating rate surplus notes through  if certain conditions are met commonly referred to as xxx notes  for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies 
in connection with this financing arrangement  prudential financial has agreed with such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a prescribed minimum level 
concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note  prudential financial enters into arrangements with the buyer  which are accounted for as derivative instruments  that may result in payments by  or to  prudential financial over the term of the surplus notes  to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes 
principal factors that impact the value of the surplus notes are mortality experience and interest rates 
as of december   there have been no payments made under the derivative instrument 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
total outstanding notes under this facility was billion both as of december  and see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during  a subsidiary of prudential insurance issued million of year floating rate surplus notes commonly referred to as axxx notes to an unaffiliated financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies 
surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in connection with this financing arrangement  prudential financial has agreed with such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a prescribed minimum level 
concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes  prudential financial entered into a credit derivative that requires prudential financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus note 
under this credit derivative  we are required to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of year credit default swap spreads on prudential financial s senior debt 
as of december   no collateral amounts were required to be paid 
as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  we expect to have borrowing needs in to finance statutory reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
several strategies are currently under review to reduce the strain of increased axxx and xxx statutory reserves associated with our 
table of contents term and universal life products 
the activities we may undertake to mitigate or address these needs include obtaining letters of credit  entering into reinsurance transactions or executing other capital market strategies  however  our ability to successfully execute these strategies will depend on market conditions 
based on current market conditions  and absent any successful mitigation efforts  we currently believe that our financing need for could be up to million for xxx and axxx combined  however this need is expected to be met with a combination of the activities described 
also  this amount will fluctuate as a result of sales levels 
if we are unsuccessful in satisfying or mitigating this strain as a result of market conditions or otherwise  this financing need could require us to increase prices and or reduce our sales of term or universal life products and or have a negative impact on our capital position 
our total borrowings consist of capital debt  investment related debt  securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses 
capital debt is borrowing that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of prudential financial as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of prudential financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements

debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with our individual annuity business  real estate franchises and relocation services 
borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral  or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets  have been classified as limited and non recourse debt

any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity position  contractual restrictions and other factors 
funding agreement notes issuance program in  prudential insurance established a funding agreement notes issuance program pursuant to which a delaware statutory trust issues medium term notes which are included in our statements of financial position in policyholders account balances and not included in the foregoing table secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by prudential insurance and included in our retirement segment 
the funding agreements 
table of contents provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium term notes 
the medium term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the securities act of the notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from two to seven years 
as of december  and  the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled billion and billion  respectively  out of a total authorized amount of up to billion 
the decrease in outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes is due to maturities in excess of issuances during our ability to issue under this program will depend on market conditions 
the aggregate maturities of these notes over the next months are approximately billion 
we intend to repay the maturing notes through a combination of cash flows from asset maturities  asset sales  new liability origination and internal sources of funds 
lines of credit and other credit facilities as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
these facilities are available to each of the borrowers  up to the aggregate committed credit  to be used for general corporate purposes 
this amount includes a billion year credit facility that expires in may  which includes financial institutions  and a billion credit facility  of which million expires in december and billion expires in december  which includes financial institutions 
the available credit and number of lenders reflects the removal in january of lehman commercial paper inc for million and lehman brothers bank fsb for million as participants in these facilities 
we maintain these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility as of december  any borrowings made under these outstanding facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and would bear interest at the rates set forth in each facility agreement 
within each facility  no single financial institution has more than of the total committed credit 
our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including the maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law and prudential financial s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least billion  which for this purpose is based on us gaap stockholders equity  excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments

as of december   prudential insurance s total adjusted capital and prudential financial s consolidated us gaap stockholders equity  excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments  exceeded the minimum amounts required to borrow under these facilities 
we also use uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions 
ratings claims paying and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products 
national recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers  including prudential insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries 
our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing

table of contents the ratings set forth above with respect to prudential financial  prudential funding  llc  prudential insurance and our other insurance and financing subsidiaries reflect current opinions of each rating organization with respect to claims paying ability  financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders or debt holders  as the case may be 
these ratings are of concern to policyholders  agents and intermediaries 
they are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock 
these ratings are reviewed periodically and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
our claims paying ratings are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and  as a result  our competitiveness 
the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ie  claims paying ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors  distributors or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability  liquidity and or capital 
in addition  we consider our own risk of non performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities 
therefore  changes in our credit ratings and our claims paying ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities 
additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  including derivative agreements  are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
a ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of december  would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately million as of december  the amount of collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our derivative agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best to a for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately billion  based on the level of statutory reserves related to an acquired business  that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately million  or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust 
we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
rating agencies use an outlook statement for both industry sectors and individual companies 
for an industry sector  a negative outlook generally implies that over the next months  the rating agency expects more downgrades than upgrades among companies in the sector 
however  such an outlook does not imply that all  or even a majority of  companies will necessarily experience ratings downgrades 
for a particular company  an outlook generally indicates a medium or long term trend generally six months to two years in credit fundamentals  which if continued  may lead to a rating change 
these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice 
moody s  s p  fitch and am best each continue to have the us life insurance sector on negative outlook  which began in late as conditions in the economy deteriorated 
in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  have requested additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels  such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
provided below is a discussion of the significant changes in our ratings or rating outlooks that occurred from the beginning of through the date of this filing

as discussed in note  we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
for further discussion of these separate account commitments  see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries asset management subsidiaries 
as discussed in note  loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 
the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  policyholder s dividends  reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current policies in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of  billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  cash collateral for loaned securities  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  and other miscellaneous liabilities 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk 
the market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk varies by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management and derivative strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements within the context of market conditions and other relative opportunities 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
certain products supported by general account investments also expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  we are exposed to the risk that asset based fees may decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
the risk of decreased asset based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
while a decrease in our estimates of total gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period  it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of interest rate  equity market  or market volatility changes may increase our net exposure to the guarantees under these contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we utilize product design elements such as asset allocation requirements  an automatic rebalancing element and minimum purchase age requirements  in addition to externally purchased hedging instruments such as interest rate and equity based derivatives to hedge or limit our market risk exposure to the benefit features of certain of our variable annuity contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts  and the guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits associated with the variable annuity contracts we issue

table of contents for risk management purposes we perform stress scenario testing to monitor the impact of extreme  but realistic adverse market events on our capital adequacy and liquidity 
this testing allows us to assess the sensitivity of our businesses to market factors and identify any concentrations of risk 
the regulatory capital levels and liquidity of our insurance companies in particular are closely monitored to ensure they remain consistent with our rating objectives 
changes to these ratings could impact our borrowing costs  our ability to access alternative sources of liquidity  and our ability to market certain products 
for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital resources see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
market fluctuations or changes in market conditions could also cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long term savings  protection and other investment products 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest rate and other market fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability see item a 
risk factors 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  retirement and annuities products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance and annuities products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage interest rate and equity exposure risk  as well as credit  liquidity and other risks  all within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 
for additional information regarding the management of our general account investments and our asset mix strategies  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments management of investments 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we use asset liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints by segment for each insurance entity 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the constraint limits 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our us regulatory cash flow for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 

table of contents market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  collectively referred to as investment contracts  and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates  reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk free rate 
the following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
as of december  notional fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities commercial mortgage and other loans policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt debt of consolidated variable interest entities investment contracts bank customer liabilities net estimated potential loss

the hypothetical change in fair value related to our variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives reflects only the gross fair value change on the embedded derivatives  and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes in fair value 
included in other liabilities together with all liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities 
the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  which are not considered financial liabilities 
we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities  including investment contracts  which are set forth in these tables 
our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of december  increased  million from december   primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in the increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in was primarily due to a net increase in fair value driven by credit spread tightening  portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income  the impact of foreign currency  and the acquisition of yamato life 
the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell for us equities 
for foreign equities we benchmark against the tokyo price index  or topix  and the msci eafe  a market index of european  australian  and far eastern equities 
we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated investment equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities 
table of contents we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us 
in addition to equity securities  as indicated above  we hold equity based derivatives primarily to hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a million liability 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a billion asset  and the living benefits features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a billion liability 
our estimated equity price risk associated with living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives  net of the related equity based derivatives used in our living benefits hedging program  was a million benefit as of december  and a less than million benefit as of december   estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels 
the higher sensitivity level as of december  primarily reflects the impact of our own risk on non performance on the embedded derivative liabilities  which does not have an offsetting impact on the hedge assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of our own risk of non performance on the valuation of the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in addition  we expanded our hedging program in the second quarter of to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business  including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures 
these capital hedges primarily consist of equity based total return swaps  as well as interest rate derivatives  that are designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products 
our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges as of december  was a million benefit  estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels  which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
these scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue  changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality  utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features 
in addition  these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk  such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
the impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity based derivatives and the related living benefit features  in comparison to the scenarios above 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios  other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and foreign currency liability issuances 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 

table of contents our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency risk first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan  korea  taiwan and europe 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
to mitigate potential losses due to fluctuations in these exchange rates  for our equity investments in our international operations other than in japan and taiwan  we generally hedge a significant portion of this exposure through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
for our equity investments in our japanese and taiwanese operations  we generally hedge this exposure through a combination of issuing foreign denominated liabilities outside these operations and by holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations 
third  our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries investing in us dollar denominated investments 
most significantly  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments in their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations 
for a discussion of our japanese operations us dollar denominated investment holdings  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments portfolio composition  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance and investments division 
we manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks  described above  within specified limits 
foreign currency exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to million 
despite a reduction in our hedging activities related to our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  primarily related to our korean insurance subsidiary  the estimated one month var as of december  decreased in comparison to the prior year due to a significant reduction in exchange rate volatility in this decrease in volatility drove the reduction in our hedging activities  which resulted in an increase in unhedged foreign currency assets as of december  the average var for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured monthly at a confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during the average one month var for increased in comparison to due to the reduction in hedging activities discussed above and the higher level of exchange rate volatility experience during the first half of these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
the estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the decreased var for foreign currency exchange risks primarily reflects decreased volatility in exchange rates for japanese yen and korean won 

table of contents derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
we are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as well as equity prices  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts 
the notional amount of derivative instruments increased billion in  from billion as of december  to billion as of december   driven by an increase in interest rate derivatives  primarily related to our variable annuity hedging activities  and an increase in investment only  fee based stable value products sold in our retirement segment  which are accounted for as derivatives 
we use credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments  and in limited instances purchase credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio 
for additional information regarding our exposure to credit derivatives  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our derivatives trading operations 
we maintain trading positions in various foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
the total var for our trading activities  which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the largest component of this total var as of december  and was related to commodities price risk 
the total average daily var for our trading activities 
table of contents considering our exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the largest component of both periods total average daily var was related to commodities price risk 
limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
