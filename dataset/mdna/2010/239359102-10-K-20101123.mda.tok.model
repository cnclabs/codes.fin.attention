overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depends  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past  and such fluctuations continue today to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
beginning in august  the prices of oil and especially natural gas declined significantly from historic highs due to reduced demand from the global economic slowdown  and during many domestic oil and natural gas companies reduced their capital expenditures due to the decrease in market prices and disruptions in the credit markets 
these factors led to a severe reduction in demand for our services and in our industry during as well as downward pressure on the prices we charge our customers for our services 
in order to better align our crew capacity with reduced demand  we reduced the number of data acquisition crews we operated from sixteen in january to nine as of october due to the reductions in the number of our active data acquisition crews and lower utilization rates for our remaining operating crews  we experienced a reduction in operating revenues and  to a lesser extent  in operating costs during calendar and into calendar beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began to experience an increase in demand for our services  particularly in the oil basins 
in response to this demand increase  we redeployed three seismic data acquisition crews in fiscal  bringing our current crew count to twelve active crews 
while demand has increased during fiscal  it has not yet returned to the levels we experienced in consequently  our revenues remain at a lower level than those we reported in fiscal and  and they may for some time until demand recovers further 
in addition  the seismic data acquisition market in the lower united states remains very competitive  which in turn continues to put pressure on the prices we charge for our services 
in light of continuing market challenges  we are maintaining our focus on containing costs and maintaining our financial strength 
equipment and 
table of contents key personnel from crews taken out of service continue to be redeployed on remaining crews as needed or otherwise remain available for rapid expansion of crew count as demand and market conditions dictate in the future 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  crew repositioning or equipment failure  and whether we enter into turnkey or day rate contracts with our clients 
consequently  our efforts to negotiate favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
during fiscal  most of our client contracts were turnkey contracts 
the percentage of revenues derived from turnkey contracts has grown in the past few years from approximately half of our revenues in fiscal to in excess of three quarters of our revenues in fiscal while turnkey contracts allow us to capitalize on improved crew productivity  we also bear more risks related to weather and crew downtime 
although our clients may cancel their service contracts on short notice  our current order book reflects commitment levels sufficient to maintain operation of our twelve data acquisition crews well into fiscal while the markets for oil and natural gas have been very volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future  and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
if economic conditions were to worsen  our customers reduce their capital expenditures  or there is a significant sustained drop in oil and natural gas prices  it would result in diminished demand for our seismic services  may cause continued downward pressure on the prices we charge and would affect our results of operations 
the services we are currently providing are balanced between clients seeking oil and natural gas 
in recent years  we have experienced periods in which the services we provided were primarily to clients seeking oil and other periods in which our clients were primarily seeking natural gas 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of previously announced reductions in active crew count during the second quarter of fiscal four crews  third quarter of fiscal two crews  and first quarter of one crew  a more competitive pricing environment in and substantially lower utilization rates of the remaining crews 
revenues in fiscal continued to include high third party charges related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources 
the sustained level of these charges is driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  east texas and arkansas 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to reductions in field personnel and other expenses associated with operating the data acquisition crews taken out of service during fiscal and as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factor in the decrease in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was a decrease in our bad debt expense 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation expense increased a relatively modest from fiscal to reflecting our limited maintenance capital expenditures in our depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase in fiscal as a result of our increased capital expenditures during fiscal our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 

table of contents taxes 
income tax benefit was  for fiscal as compared to income tax expense of  for fiscal the effective tax rate for the income tax provision for fiscal and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a reduction in active crew count during the second quarter of fiscal four crews and the third quarter of fiscal two crews  a more competitive pricing environment  substantially lower utilization rates for remaining crews and  in the fourth quarter  increased downtime for weather 
recorded in fiscal revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources  all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained level of these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  arkansas  east texas and louisiana 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to reductions in field personnel and other expenses of operating the six data acquisition crews taken out of service during the second and third quarters of fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factor in the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts during the year of  offset by bad debts during the year of approximately  resulting in a net allowance for doubtful accounts at september  of  the deductions against the bad debt allowance were primarily a result of the settlement of a previously disputed invoice for approximately  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal based on our review of the past due accounts and client base 
during the second quarter  we became aware that one client with an accounts receivable balance of approximately  and two former clients had filed for reorganization under bankruptcy protection 
these facts significantly influenced management s decision to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts during the second quarter 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting the full year of depreciation expense from our fiscal capital expenditures 
due to market conditions  capital expenditures in fiscal were limited to necessary maintenance capital requirements 
our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the effective tax rate for the income tax provision for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate between periods was primarily a result of an increase in the unrecognized tax benefits reserve for prior years  changes in tax rates as a result of the varying states in which we operate from year to year and the increasing impact of permanent tax differences resulting from lower income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  and to some extent  our capital expenditures 

table of contents cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects our substantial decline in revenues and income beginning in fiscal in addition  working capital components had the impact of decreasing cash flows in while increasing cash flows in although our cash flows from accounts receivable fluctuated during this period  this did not reflect any change in our collection experience during the period as the average number of days in accounts receivable has remained at approximately fifty two over the last twelve months 
amounts in our trade accounts receivable that are over sixty days as of september  represent approximately of our total trade accounts receivables  which is relatively high compared to historical levels 
the remaining outstanding trade account balances after taking into consideration payments received subsequent to september  and additional payments anticipated by management  is more representative of historical levels 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at september  is adequate to cover exposures related to the remaining trade account balances 
as discussed above  the decrease in revenues during fiscal was not matched by a decrease in operating expenses  and as a result  our margins and net results from operating activities were negatively affected 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  we reinvested  of our  proceeds of matured treasury investments 
at september  a treasury note for  had matured and was reflected as cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet 
approximately  of these funds were invested in certificates of deposit subsequent to september  due to market conditions  our capital expenditures in fiscal were limited to necessary maintenance capital requirements rather than investing in additional equipment as in the past few years 
during fiscal  our capital expenditures increased as discussed below 
during fiscal  we used cash generated from operations in excess of capital expenditures to acquire short term investments 
in fiscal  we collected proceeds from an insurance claim on our equipment burned in a march wildfire of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and fiscal of  and  respectively  primarily represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal of  primarily represents the net decrease on our revolving line of credit loan agreement from a balance at september  of  to a zero balance at september  we have not drawn on our revolving line of credit during fiscal years or capital expenditures 
for fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of  in part  to purchase oyo gsr recording boxes  expand channel count on existing crews and meet necessary maintenance capital requirements 
the board of directors has approved an initial fiscal budget of  which will be used to purchase  additional oyo gsr four channel recording boxes along with three component geophones and ten inova ahv vibrator energy source units  and the remainder will be used to increase channel count  make technical improvements in various phases of our operations and meet maintenance capital requirements 
we believe that these additions will allow us to maintain our competitive position as we respond to client desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording services and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs from time to time through public equity offerings 
our revolving line of credit loan agreement is with western national bank 
the agreement permits us to borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until june  up to million based on the borrowing base calculation as defined in the agreement 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral 
interest on the facility accrues at an annual rate equal to either the day london interbank offered rate libor  plus two and one quarter percent or the prime rate  minus three quarters percent as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of 
interest on the outstanding amount under the loan agreement is payable monthly 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit 
table of contents facilities of this type  including limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and reorganizations 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities and debt to tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  and november  we have not utilized the line of credit loan agreement during the fiscal years ended september  or on march   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec covering the periodic offer and sale of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common stock and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be filed separately with the sec at the time of the offering 
the filing of the shelf registration statement will enable us to act quickly if and when opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations with initial terms exceeding one year as of september  payments due by period in s less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations we believe that our capital resources and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business including the demand for our seismic services from clients 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
under both types of agreements  we recognize revenues when revenue is realizable and services are performed 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
revenues are considered realizable when earned according to the terms of the service contracts 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 

table of contents in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
as services are performed  those deferred revenue amounts are recognized as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our review of past due accounts  our past experience of historical write offs and our current client base 
while the collectibility of outstanding client invoices is continually assessed  the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our clients 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets and the fair value of the assets is below the carrying value of the assets 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and expenses based on our anticipated future results while considering anticipated future oil and gas prices  which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  we measure the amount of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment are capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations for the period 
tax accounting 
we account for our income taxes with the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the year of an enacted rate change 
the deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create a variance between actual results and estimates and could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards  including stock options and restricted stock  using the fair value method and recognize compensation cost  net of forfeitures  in our financial statements 
we record compensation expense as operating or general and administrative expense as appropriate in the statements of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock options or restricted stock awards 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update fair value measurements and disclosures topic as new guidance and clarification for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for us as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices which affect demand for and pricing of our services as well as interest rate fluctuations 
our revolving line of credit carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit bear interest at our monthly direction of the lower of the prime rate minus three quarters percent or the day libor plus two and one quarter percent  subject to an interest rate floor of 
at september   we had no balances outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
the contractual maturities of our short term investments range from november to april our short term investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale 
if these short term investments are not held to maturity  the proceeds obtained when the instruments are sold will be impacted by the current interest rates at the time they are sold 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally  so we are not generally subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
