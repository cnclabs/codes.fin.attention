table of contents we reduced our accrual related to claims against our brazilian subsidiary which was acquired by us due to our acquisition of lipman by million million brazilian reais as a result of a filed settlement of disputed payables and expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax contingencies 
of this amount  million was reversed against other income expense  net  and million which consisted of accrued interest related to the claims was reversed against interest expense 
we recorded million of goodwill impairment charges in fiscal year after we concluded that the carrying amount of the north america and asia reporting units exceeded their implied fair values

we reduced our accrual for brazilian customs penalties by million million brazilian reais as a result of the dismissal of one of the assessments 
of this amount  million was reversed against general and administrative expenses and million was reversed against interest expense 
this reduction was partially offset by the accrual for legal fees related to a contingency legal representation agreement entered into between one of our brazilian subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary from lipman and brazilian counsel pursuant to which our brazilian subsidiary has agreed to pay to brazilian counsel legal fees in the amount of million million brazilian reais for achieving the successful dismissal of the assessment

overview we are a global leader in secure electronic payment solutions 
we provide expertise  solutions  and services that add value to the point of sale with merchant operated  consumer facing  and self service payment systems for the financial  retail  hospitality  petroleum  government  transportation  and healthcare vertical markets 
we are one of the largest providers of electronic payment systems worldwide 
we believe that we benefit from a number of competitive advantages gained through our year history of success in our industry 
these advantages include our globally trusted brand name  large installed base  significant involvement in the development of industry standards  global operating scale  customizable platforms  and investment in research and development 
we believe that these advantages position us well to capitalize on the continuing global shift toward electronic payment transactions 
our industry s growth continues to be driven by the long term shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to changes in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems 
internationally  growth rates have generally been higher than the united states because of the relatively low penetration rates of electronic payment transactions in many countries as well as governmental efforts to modernize economies and to encourage electronic payments as a means of improving collection of value added tax vat and sales tax 
recently  additional factors have driven growth  including the shift from dial up to internet protocol ip developments in wireless communications  personal identification number pin based debit transactions and advances in computing technology that enable vertical solutions and non payment applications to reside at the point of sale pos 
most recently  there have been widely publicized breaches of systems that handle consumer card details  spurring widespread interest in more secure payment systems and end to end encryption technology 
security has continued to be a driving factor in our business as our customers endeavor to meet escalating governmental requirements directed toward the prevention of identity theft as well as operating safeguards imposed by the credit and debit card associations  which include visa international visa  mastercard worldwide mastercard  american express  discover financial services  and jcb co  ltd 
jcb 
in september  these card associations established the payment card industry security standards council pci ssc to oversee and unify industry standards in the areas of debit and credit card data security 
standards include payment card industry pin transaction security pci pts for pin entry devices  pci dss for enterprise data security and pa dss for payment application data security 
we are a leader in providing systems and software solutions that meet these standards 

table of contents timing of our revenue recognition may cause our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter 
specifically  revenues recognized in some of our past fiscal quarters have been back end weighted when we received sales orders and delivered a higher proportion of our system solutions toward the end of such fiscal quarters 
this back end weighting of orders may adversely affect our results of operations in a number of ways and could negatively impact revenues and profits 
first  the product mix of orders may not align with manufacturing forecasts  which could result in a shortage of the components needed for production 
second  existing manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to deliver a high volume of orders in a concentrated time at quarter end 
third  back end weighted demand could negatively impact gross margins through higher labor  delivery and other manufacturing and distribution costs 
if  on the other hand  we were to seek to manage the fulfillment of back end weighted orders through holding increased inventory levels  we would risk higher inventory obsolescence charges if our sales fall short of our expectations 
because timing of our revenue recognition depends on timing of product shipments  decisions we make about product shipments  particularly toward the end of a fiscal quarter  may impact our reported revenues 
the timing of product shipments may depend on a number of factors  including price discussions with our customers  operating costs  including costs of air shipments if required  the delivery date requested by customers and our operating capacity to fill orders and ship products  as well as our own long and short term business planning 
these factors may affect timing of shipment and consequently revenues recognized for a particular period 
we operate in two business segments north america and international 
we define north america as the united states and canada  and international as all other countries from which we derive revenues 
during fiscal year demand for wireless  ip enabled  pin based debit and vertical solutions was adversely affected by the global financial crisis 
specifically  we experienced lower north american demand as retailers closed redundant or underperforming locations and lower international demand due to the adverse foreign currency impact on the purchasing power of certain international customers 
with the exception of china  emerging markets declined at a greater rate than developed markets in fiscal year in fiscal year  our sales to emerging economies  particularly in latin america and asia  generally recovered more quickly than developed economies 
demand in developed countries increased as well  primarily due to the need for our customers to upgrade their systems in order to comply with the july  pci ped deadline 
to a lesser degree  demand in developed countries increased as a result of modestly improving macroeconomic conditions 
to the extent the economic recovery continues  we expect demand from emerging economies and certain north american vertical businesses to grow faster than our traditional solutions sold in developed markets 
additionally  demand in north america benefited from the integration of our media solutions business and we intend to expand the media solutions business into other geographies beginning in fiscal year we continue to devote research and development r d resources to address the market needs of both emerging and developed economies 
in november  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire hypercom corporation 
this planned acquisition is subject to shareholder approval and customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the second half of for further information  see note subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
results of operations net revenues we generate net revenues through the sale of our electronic payment systems and solutions that enable electronic payment transactions  which we identify as system solutions  as well as warranty and support services  field deployment  advertising  installation and upgrade services  and customer specific application development  which we identify as services 

table of contents net revenues  which include system solutions and services  are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended october  change change change change system solutions services total system solutions revenues system solutions net revenues increased million  or in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  system solutions net revenues comprised of total net revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the lower proportion of system solutions net revenues reflects the inclusion of services revenues from our media solutions business following the acquisition of clear channel taxi media  llc cctm in december  as well as growth in petroleum services 
international system solutions net revenues increased million  or  in the fiscal year ended october   compared to the fiscal year ended october  system solutions net revenues in latin america increased million  or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of strong demand in brazil for the vx solution and significant increases in sales volume from several major customers 
asia s system solutions net revenues increased million  or  during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily attributable to increases across the region  where economic conditions were generally improved compared to the prior fiscal year 
europe s system solutions net revenues decreased million  or  in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to lower sales in turkey and the balkan countries as a result of an economic slowdown  partially offset by improved sales in certain parts of continental europe 
north america system solutions net revenues increased million  or  in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to an increase in our petroleum system solutions revenues  partially offset by a decrease in our north america financial business revenues 
the revenue increase in the petroleum business was driven by pci compliance efforts by customers  as more of our petroleum customers addressed the july pci ped compliance deadlines 
our north america financial business  which sells payment systems to small and medium sized businesses through isos and payment processors  was constrained overall due to persistent adverse economic conditions which have slowed retail store openings 
a weaker macroeconomic environment continued to negatively impact our net revenues in certain regions during the fiscal year ended october  although recently there have been some signs of improvement in the financial markets and economic conditions  certain countries  including parts of europe  have experienced continued or further economic stress in we are unable to predict whether signs of improvements in the united states and other countries earlier this year will be sustained 
any sustained economic weakness or deterioration in economic conditions  particularly if persistent  would adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we expect the strong system solutions demand from our petroleum customers  due to the july pci ped compliance deadline  to continue as they move toward the next pci compliance deadline which is july  in contrast  we expect system solutions demand from multi lane retailers to be more moderate following the passing of the july deadline 
system solutions net revenues decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  system solutions net revenues comprised of total net revenues in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year 
table of contents international system solutions net revenues for the year ended october  decreased million  or  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a million  or  decline in latin america and a million  or  decrease in europe  partially offset by a million  or  increase in asia 
in latin america  the decreases in system solutions net revenues were primarily driven by decreased sales in brazil and venezuela due to the economic contraction and falling local currencies throughout most of the year  and a reduction in purchasing from one large brazilian customer for the first three quarters of fiscal year in europe  the decline was primarily attributable to the weak economic conditions in russia and spain  partially offset by growth relating to shipments to new financial customers in the united kingdom and certain nordic countries 
asia revenue growth was predominately attributable to revenue growth in china  where our sales have been less impacted than other countries by the global recession 
north america system solutions net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  decreased million or  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a decrease in our us financial business and canada revenues 
our us financial business  was constrained overall due to persistent adverse economic conditions which have slowed retail store openings 
multi lane retail system solutions sales were relatively flat as the majority of large customers completed their upgrade programs and sales activity diminished in the second half of the fiscal year 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in petroleum system solutions revenues as this customer group in the second half of the fiscal year began to address the july pci ped compliance deadlines 
services revenues services net revenues increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  international services revenues increased million  or  in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the same periods in fiscal year  primarily due to growth in the brazilian installed base which in turn led to increased demand for maintenance and support services  as well as a million currency related increase due to the appreciation of the brazilian real 
north america services revenues increased million  or  in the year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  the majority of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of revenues from our media solutions business resulting from the cctm acquisition in december  as well as growth in petroleum services 
services net revenues increased million  or for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to the growth in our european software maintenance and extended warranty services  partially offset by a reduction in custom software projects for our petroleum customers 
gross profit the following table shows the gross profit and gross profit percentages for system solutions and services in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended october  amounts amounts amounts system solutions services total 
table of contents system solutions gross profit on system solutions increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended october   compared to the fiscal year ended october  for the fiscal years ended october  and  gross profit on system solutions represented and  respectively  of system solutions net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended october   international gross profit percentage increased  north american gross profit percentage was relatively flat  and corporate costs as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to the fiscal year ended october  international gross profit percentage increased during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily as a result of a more favorable pricing environment in latin america in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in addition  we experienced a favorable product mix impact due to increased sales of newer product solutions  which carry higher margins compared to previous generation solutions 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in the wireless gross profit percentage largely due to pricing pressure from competitors and a shift in sales towards emerging market countries which typically carry lower margins 
north america system solutions gross profit percentage was relatively flat for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  we experienced increased price competition in our wireless and high end landline financial solutions and a shift in product mix toward lower margin products in our petroleum business 
these factors were partially offset by favorable product mix in desktop solutions and cost reductions in the core financial solutions sold in north america 
corporate costs are comprised of acquisition charges  including amortization of purchased intangible assets  and other corporate charges  including inventory obsolescence and scrap  rework  specific warranty provisions  non standard freight and over and under absorption of materials management and supply chain engineering overhead 
since these costs are generally incurred on a company wide basis  it is impractical to allocate them to either the north america or international segments 
corporate costs as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year ended october  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory and scrap charges 
we recorded million in excess and obsolete inventory and scrap charges in fiscal year due to changing demand experienced in fiscal year as a result of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in the fiscal year ended october   we recorded million of excess and obsolete inventory and scrap charges 
gross profit on system solutions decreased million  or for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily because of lower revenue levels 
gross profit on system solutions represented and  respectively  of system solutions net revenues for the fiscal years ended october  and for the fiscal year ended october   our international gross profit percentage improved modestly  our north america gross profit percentage declined slightly and our corporate costs as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the fiscal year ended october  international gross profit percentage improved during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily as a result of a lower mix of sales to certain emerging markets where gross profit percentages are typically lower than gross profit percentages for developed market sales 
additionally  international gross margin benefited from improved sales and operational execution in the united kingdom 
partially offsetting these improvements was a lower average selling price in latin america  in part due to the declining purchasing power of customers who experienced currency devaluations and in part due to a program to sell slow moving inventory in the first six months of our fiscal year ended october  north america system solutions gross profit percentage declined slightly during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as sales shifted away from wireless 
table of contents solutions  which typically carry higher than average gross profit percentages and toward lower margin landline solutions 
we also experienced increased price competition in our high end landline financial solutions and a shift in product mix toward lower margin product in our petroleum business 
the decrease in corporate costs for fiscal year was primarily a result of a million reduction in amortization of core and developed technology assets  a million reversal of a warranty claim associated with an acquired product  and a million reduction in amortization of step down in deferred revenue on acquisition 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of million of excess and obsolescence provision in the first half of fiscal year in conjunction with the changing demand we experienced in the first half of fiscal year as a result of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment 
services gross profit on services increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october   largely attributable to the million increase in services revenues partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentages that was attributable largely to a shift in our service mix 
gross profit on services represented and of services net revenues  respectively  for the fiscal years ended october  and gross margin percentages declined in north america  primarily due to a service mix shift towards lower margin media solutions services following our acquisition of cctm 
international gross margin percentages improved for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  due to more favorable service mix 
gross profit on services increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  gross profit represented of services net revenues for the fiscal year ended october   compared to of services net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  the majority of this increase was attributable to the improved operational efficiencies in our london service center  cost reduction initiatives associated with our north american call center  and a favorable service mix 
we expect the gross profit percentages  both system solutions and services  of our international segment to continue to be lower than the comparable gross profit percentages in our north america segment 
research and development expenses r d expenses for the fiscal years ended october    and are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended october  change change change change research and development percentage of net revenues r d expenses for the fiscal year ended october   including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  increased million  or  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to a million increase in expenses associated with our vx evolution launch and mobile payment initiative 
these incremental expenses consisted primarily of a million increase in personnel related costs and a million increase in outside services  materials and supplies  and travel 
in addition  r d expenses increased by million as a result of increased demand for localized solutions across the world 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in stock based compensation expense  and a million reduction in restructuring expenses 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a million unfavorable impact on r d expenses during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  
table of contents r d expenses for the fiscal year ended october   decreased million  or  compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily driven by a million decrease in personnel and outside services costs and a million decrease in expenditure for engineering supplies and materials 
these decreases were due to the cancelling of certain r d projects as a result of lower anticipated demand caused by the economic downturn  cost reductions in response to global recession and increased savings as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  a million reduction in restructuring costs in fiscal year ended october  and the non recurrence of a million write off of capitalized software recorded in fiscal year ended october  contributed to the decrease in r d expenses 
we expect r d expenses  assuming a stable currency environment  to grow modestly in absolute amounts 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal years ended october    and are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended october  change change change change sales and marketing percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended october   including the impact of currency exchange rates  increased million  or  compared to the fiscal year ended october  international sales and marketing expenses increased million primarily to support higher demand as moderate growth resumed in developed countries and double digit revenue growth occurred in certain emerging markets countries 
north america sales expenses increased by million largely due to higher demand in our petroleum business and initiatives in vertical and payment based media 
the above mentioned increases primarily consisted of personnel related expenses 
in addition  north america and corporate marketing expenses grew in total by million 
the increase was primarily a result of the launch of a number of new initiatives such as payment based media  end to end encryption and mobile phone credit card acceptance 
corporate sales expenses increased by million as the result of the resumption of an annual corporate sales event that was not held in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  stock based compensation expense increased by million compared to fiscal year and we expensed million for a business acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in restructuring expenses 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a million unfavorable impact on sales and marketing expenses in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the year ended october  sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to a million decrease in personnel and outside services costs from a global reduction in headcount in sales and marketing  and a million decrease in spending on travel  trade shows  events and marketing communications 
these reductions were initiated in response to the global economic crisis 
in addition  we experienced a favorable foreign exchange rate impact and a million decrease in restructuring expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a million net increase in stock based compensation expense 
we expect sales and marketing expenses  assuming a stable currency environment  to grow modestly in absolute amounts 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended october    and are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended october  change change change change general and administrative percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended october   including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  increased million  or  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs mainly as the result of increased headcount  self insured medical expenses  and bonuses as business performance improved  the non recurrence of a million reversal of a lipman pre acquisition contingency accrual for a brazilian importation tax assessment in fiscal year  and a million increase in acquisition related expenses 
partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in restructuring related expenses due to lower restructuring activities  a million reduction in outside services driven by reduced tax accounting professional service fees in connection with the transfer of certain tax accounting functions to our in house staff  as we addressed remediation of the material weakness in our internal controls related to income taxes  a million decrease as a result of the non recurrence of certain expenses related to restatement and remediation related expenses recorded in the fiscal year ended october   and the non recurrence of the million in litigation and legal settlement fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a million unfavorable impact on general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to the non recurrence of million of expenses related to the restatement of our interim financial results incurred in the fiscal year and a reversal of a million lipman pre acquisition contingency accrual for a brazilian importation tax assessment that was dismissed in the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  fiscal year general and administrative expenses were also impacted by a million reduction in outside services costs and a million decrease in travel expense  both driven by cost reduction initiatives 
partially offsetting these decreases were a million net increase in stock based compensation expense mainly as a result of the surrender of certain employee stock options and a million increase in restructuring and accelerated depreciation expenses 
we expect regular general and administrative expenses  assuming a stable currency environment  to grow modestly in absolute amounts 
we also expect significant incremental acquisition related expenses as a result of our planned acquisition of hypercom corporation which we announced in november impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our review for potential indicators of impairment performed during fiscal year and our annual impairment test did not result in any impairment of goodwill in the fiscal year ended october  as a result of the december  goodwill impairment test  we concluded that the carrying amount of our north america and asia reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the corporate segment during the first quarter of fiscal year for these reporting units 
we finalized the goodwill evaluation process and recorded a million reduction to the estimated impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal year the net carrying value of goodwill in the north america and international segments was reduced by million and million  respectively 
the final impairment charge for the north america and asia reporting units was million for the fiscal year ended october  
table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased million  or in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to a decrease in the remaining net book value of intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased million  or in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as a result of our impairment analysis in october  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to the write down to fair value of the net carrying value of certain developed and core technology intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  was primarily attributable to the lower carrying value of the purchased intangible assets subsequent to the recognition of the above mentioned impairment charge 
interest expense interest expense increased million in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily attributable to the effect of reversals of accrued interest related to lipman pre acquisition contingency accruals for brazilian importation tax assessments 
we reversed million and million of accrued interest related to brazilian tax assessments in the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively  which had the effect of increasing interest expense by million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of lower effective interest rates on our term b loan as libor rates declined substantially over the periods  a decrease in the outstanding balance of our term b loan due to repayment and a decrease in convertible notes due to repurchases 
interest expense decreased million in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to lower effective interest rates on our term b loan as libor rates continued to decline substantially over fiscal year and the reversal of million of accrued interest related to a lipman pre acquisition contingency for the brazilian importation tax assessment that was dismissed in the third quarter of fiscal year see note commitment and contingencies for additional information 
interest income interest income decreased million in the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily because of the lower effective interest rates during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  partially offset by the impact of higher average cash balances 
interest income decreased million for the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  the decrease was because of the lower effective interest rates during the fiscal year ended october  partially offset by the impact of higher average cash balances 
other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  primarily due to the non recurrence of a million gain on extinguishment of debt subsequent to the adoption of asc recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year and a million reversal of previously accrued non deductible penalty and interest charges after we received an israeli tax refund in the first quarter of fiscal year we also recorded a million loss on equity investment in fiscal year as a result of the semtek acquisition 
the loss represented the difference between the current fair value of our initial investment in semtek and the cost of such investment 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain on the reversal of lipman pre acquisition contingency accruals as a result of settlement of disputed payables and expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax contingencies and million of gain as a result of the release of sales tax and stamp duty accruals following the resolution of the underlying matters during the fiscal year ended october  
table of contents other income expense  net increased million during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  mainly due to a million gain on extinguishment of debt subsequent to the adoption of asc and a million reduction in foreign exchange losses 
in april  we repurchased and extinguished million par value of our outstanding convertible notes for million  excluding accrued interest paid 
as a result  we realized a million gain on these transactions  net of a million write off of related deferred debt issuance costs 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  we recorded a revised gain of approximately million 
the reduction in foreign exchange losses was primarily attributable to the non recurrence of a million foreign exchange loss recorded in fiscal year as a result of an un hedged israeli tax accrual and improved effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging programs in fiscal year provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million and an income tax provision of million for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the income tax benefit recorded for the fiscal year ended october  was primarily attributable to the recognition of a worthless stock deduction 
we determined that one of our uk subsidiaries is insolvent on a fair market value basis and that it became worthless during the year resulting in a worthless stock deduction of million for us tax purposes 
we intend to carry back the majority of the loss generated from this transaction to fiscal years and and seek to obtain a cash refund of approximately million 
as of october   we remain in a net deferred tax liability position 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate sufficient us and foreign taxable income in future periods 
we have recorded a million deferred tax asset in the united states which we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we have determined that it is not more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets in the united states and deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions will be realized 
we therefore continue to record a full valuation allowance against these assets as of october  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters as we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future domestic and certain foreign taxable income 
tax loss carry forwards of million are primarily related to tax losses in ireland of million  in the united states of million  in the united kingdom of million  in israel of million  and various other non us countries of million 
approximately million of foreign tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely 
the remaining balance of approximately million of tax losses is subject to limited carry forward terms of to years 
we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years and and additionally we have been notified they will audit fiscal year the fiscal years and examination was concluded during the year with some unagreed issues which we have formally protested and the case is now at appeals 
we believe we will be successful in resolving the unagreed issues at the appeals level 
the significant unagreed items relate to inventory where the irs has proposed an adjustment to reduce cost of goods sold 
we believe their rationale to adjust the cost of goods sold is without merit 
although we believe we have correctly provided income taxes for the years subject to audit  the irs proposed adjustments  which if not resolved in our favor  could result in a significant impact on our provision for income taxes 
some of our foreign subsidiaries are also under audit namely israel for calendar years to  mexico for calendar year and india for calendar years to with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to tax examination for periods prior to we revised the terms and conditions of the singapore pioneer tax holiday for fiscal years through we expect to maintain our pioneer status tax rate of in singapore through the holiday period 
the tax benefit of the tax holiday for the years ended october   and was million per diluted share  million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 

table of contents effective november   we adopted asc accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we have recorded our asc liability as a long term liability as we do not expect significant payments to occur over the next months 
our existing tax positions will continue to generate an increase in liabilities for uncertain tax benefits 
we will continue to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced upon closure of tax examinations or if the statute of limitations on certain tax filings expires without assessment from the tax authorities 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that there could be a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitation expirations in multiple tax jurisdictions during the next months of zero to million 
interest and penalties accrued on these uncertain tax positions will also be released upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations

in accordance with the provisions of asc  we recorded a revised gain of approximately million 
in december  we repurchased and extinguished million par value of our outstanding notes for million  excluding accrued interest 
we recorded a million gain in accordance with asc as of october  and  the remaining par values of the notes were million and million  respectively 
the notes were issued under the indenture between verifone and us bank national association  as trustee 
each  of principal of the notes are initially convertible into shares of verifone common stock  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity during specified periods as follows on any date during any fiscal quarter beginning after october  and only during such fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of our common stock was more than of the then current conversion price for at least trading days in the period of the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter  at any time on or after march   if we distribute  to all holders of its common stock  rights or warrants other than pursuant to a rights plan entitling them to purchase  for a period of calendar days or less  shares of our common stock at a price less than the average closing sale price for the ten trading days preceding the declaration date for such distribution  if we distribute  to all holders of its common stock  cash or other assets  debt securities  or rights to purchase our securities other than pursuant to a rights plan  which distribution has a per share value exceeding of the closing sale price of our common stock on the trading day preceding the declaration date for such distribution  during a specified period if certain types of fundamental changes occur  or during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes was less than of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period multiplied by the then current conversion rate 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock  up to the principal amount of the note 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  will be paid in stock 
as of october   none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to the maturity date  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any up to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the related collateral and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries including any secured indebtedness of such subsidiaries 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of the initial purchasers the counterparties  consisting of lehman brothers otc derivatives lehman derivatives and jpmorgan chase bank  national association  london branch 
these note hedge transactions serve to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the outstanding notes in the event that the volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day of the relevant conversion period or other relevant valuation period for the notes is greater than 
the cost of the note hedge transactions was 
table of contents approximately million 
the note hedge transactions are set to expire on the earlier of the last day on which any notes remain outstanding and june  the filing by lehman brothers of a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in september constituted an event of default under the note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives and the related guaranty by lehman brothers  giving us the immediate right to terminate the note hedge transaction and entitling us to claim reimbursement for the loss incurred in terminating and closing out the transaction 
lehman derivatives and lehman brothers ability to perform their obligations under the note hedge transaction is unclear 
to date we have not recovered any amounts or reimbursement related to the note hedge transactions with lehman derivatives and there can be no assurance we will ever receive any amounts  reimbursement or recovery related to the obligations of lehman derivatives and lehman brothers with respect to this note hedge transaction 
excluding the note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives and net of the extinguishment of a portion of our outstanding notes through repurchases as described above  as of october   we held note hedge transactions that reduce the potential dilution by one half upon conversion of the outstanding notes in the event that the volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day of the relevant conversion period or other relevant valuation period for the notes is greater than 
in addition  we sold warrants to the counterparties whereby they have the option to purchase up to approximately million shares of verifone common stock at a price of per share 
we received approximately million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants 
the warrants expire in equal amounts on each trading day from december  to february  the cost incurred in connection with the note hedge transactions and the proceeds from the sale of the warrants  are included as a net reduction in additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of october  and  in accordance with the guidance in asc derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands for the fiscal years ending october  total thereafter term b loan including interest senior convertible notes including interest capital lease obligations and other loans operating leases minimum purchase obligations interest in the above table has been calculated using the rate in effect at october  we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with cash flows from our operations 
to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with cash flows from operations  we intend to fund these obligations and commitments with proceeds from the million available under our revolving loan under our secured credit facility or future debt or equity financings 
manufacturing agreements we work on a purchase order basis with third party contract manufacturers with facilities in china  singapore  israel and brazil  and component suppliers located throughout the world to supply nearly all of our finished goods inventories  spare parts  and accessories 
we generally provide each such supplier with a purchase 
table of contents order to cover the manufacturing requirements  which constitutes a binding commitment by us to purchase materials and finished goods produced by the manufacturer as specified in the purchase order 
these purchase orders are generally considered to be non cancellable and are generally paid within one year of the issuance date 
as of october   the amount of purchase commitments issued to contract manufacturers and component suppliers totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million has been recorded in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because these commitments are not expected to have future value to us 
we utilize a limited number of third parties to manufacture our products and rely upon these contract manufacturers to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost 
furthermore  a majority of our manufacturing activities is concentrated in china 
as a result  disruptions to the business or operations of the contract manufacturers or to their ability to produce the required products in a timely manner  and particularly disruptions to these manufacturing facilities located in china  could significantly impact our business and operations 
in addition  a number of components that are necessary to manufacture and assemble our systems are specifically customized for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis 
because of the customized nature of these components and the limited number of available suppliers  it would be difficult and costly to find alternative sources in a timely manner 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of the sec s regulation s k  consist of foreign exchange forward contracts described under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents  and receivables  are not affected by inflation because they are short term 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill  and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of goods sold and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of system solutions and services offered by us 
critical accounting polices and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with usgaap 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies include our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note principles of consolidation and summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in
