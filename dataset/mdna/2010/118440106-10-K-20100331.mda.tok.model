the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the company s financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements included in this form k 
executive overview company management considers the following items to be key performance indicators in evaluating company performance 
comparable store sales stores are deemed to be comparable stores if they were open in the prior year on the first day of the fiscal period being presented 
stores which have been remodeled  expanded  and or relocated  but would otherwise be included as comparable stores  are not excluded from the comparable store sales calculation 
online sales are excluded from comparable store sales 
management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of current company performance  helping leverage certain fixed costs when results are positive 
negative comparable store sales results could reduce net sales and have a negative impact on operating leverage  thus reducing net earnings 
net merchandise margins management evaluates the components of merchandise margin including initial markup and the amount of markdowns during a period 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in the company s use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on the company s gross margin and results of operations 
operating margin operating margin is a good indicator for management of the company s success 
operating margin can be positively or negatively affected by comparable store sales  merchandise margins  occupancy costs  and the company s ability to control operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital management reviews current cash and short term investments along with cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities to determine the company s short term cash needs for operations and expansion 
the company believes that existing cash  short term investments  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund current and long term anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next several years

ars have a long term stated maturity  but are reset through a dutch auction process that occurs every to days  depending on the terms of the individual security 
during february  a significant number of auctions related to these securities failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the failed auctions have limited the current liquidity of the company s investments in ars and the company has reason to believe that certain of the underlying issuers of its ars are currently at risk 
the company does not anticipate  however  that further auction failures will have a material impact on the company s ability to fund its business 
ars and preferred securities are reported at fair market value  and as of january   the reported investment amount is net of a million temporary impairment and a million other than temporary impairment otti to account for the impairment of certain securities from their stated par value

additional indicators of impairment include the duration and severity of the decline in market value 
the interest rates on these investments will be determined by the terms of each individual ars 
the material risks associated with the ars held by the company include those stated above as well as the current economic environment  downgrading of credit ratings on investments held  and the volatility of the entities backing each of the issues 
in addition  the company considers qualitative factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of the investee  the credit rating of the investee  and the current and expected market and industry conditions in which the investee operates 
the company believes it has the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of market value occurs 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the buckle  inc s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory  investments  incentive bonuses  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on past experience and on various other factors that are thought to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the estimates and judgments used in preparing these financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those critical accounting policies that management believes require subjective and or complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results of operations 
revenue recognition 
retail store sales are recorded upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
online sales are recorded when merchandise is delivered to the customer  with the time of delivery being based on estimated shipping time from the company s distribution center to the customer 
shipping fees charged to customers are included in revenue and shipping costs are included in selling expenses 
the company accounts for layaway sales in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition  recognizing revenue from sales made under its layaway program upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
revenue is not recorded when gift cards and gift certificates are sold  but rather when a card or certificate is redeemed for merchandise 
a current liability for unredeemed gift cards and certificates is recorded at the time the card or certificate is purchased 
the amounts of the gift certificate and gift card liabilities are determined using the outstanding balances from the prior three and four years of issuance  respectively 
the liability recorded for unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards was million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the company records breakage as other income when the probability of redemption  which is based on historical redemption patterns  is remote 
breakage reported for the fiscal years ended january   january   and february  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the company establishes a liability for estimated merchandise returns based upon the historical average sales return percentage 
customer returns could potentially exceed the historical average  thus reducing future net sales results and potentially reducing future net earnings 
the accrued liability for reserve for sales returns was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using an average cost method that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
management makes adjustments to inventory and cost of goods sold  based upon estimates  to reserve for merchandise obsolescence and markdowns that could affect market value  based on assumptions using calculations applied to current inventory levels within each of four different markdown levels 
management also reviews the levels of inventory in each markdown group and the overall aging of the inventory versus the estimated future demand for such product and the current market conditions 
such judgments could vary significantly from actual results  either favorably or unfavorably  due to fluctuations in future economic conditions  industry trends  consumer demand  and the competitive retail environment 
such changes in market conditions could negatively impact the sale of markdown inventory  causing further markdowns or inventory obsolescence  resulting in increased cost of goods sold from write offs and reducing the company s net earnings 
the liability recorded as a reserve for markdowns and or obsolescence was million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the company is not aware of any events  conditions  or changes in demand or price that would indicate that its inventory valuation may not be materially accurate at this time 
income taxes 
the company records a deferred tax asset and liability for expected future tax consequences resulting from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more than likely that these assets will not be realized  the company would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
estimating the value of these assets is based upon the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  such value would be increased 
adjustment would be made to increase net income in the period such determination was made 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses  and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing lease incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  the company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when the company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays  the company records a deferred rent liability on the balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the statements of income 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  the company records minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases on the statements of income 
certain leases provide for contingent rents  which are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability on the balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or are reasonably probable to be achieved 
investments

these investments are classified as available for sale securities and are reported at fair market values of million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the company reviews impairment in accordance with fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities  to determine the classification of potential impairments as either temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in other comprehensive income 
an impairment that is considered other than temporary would be recognized in net income 
the company considers various factors in reviewing impairment  including the duration and severity of the decline in market value 
in addition  the company considers qualitative factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of the investee  the credit rating of the investee  the current and expected market and industry conditions in which the investee operates  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the company believes it has the ability and maintains its intent to hold these investments until recovery of market value occurs 
the company determined the fair value of ars using level inputs for known or anticipated subsequent redemptions at par value  level inputs using observable inputs  and level using unobservable inputs  where the following criteria were considered in estimating fair value pricing was provided by the custodian of ars  pricing was provided by a third party broker for ars  sales of similar securities  quoted prices for similar securities in active markets  quoted prices for publicly traded preferred securities  quoted prices for similar assets in markets that are not active including markets where there are few transactions for the asset  the prices are not current  or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers  or in which little information is released publicly  pricing was provided by a third part valuation consultant using level inputs 
in addition  the company considers other factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of the investee  the credit rating  insurance  guarantees  collateral  cash flows  and the current and expected market and industry conditions in which the investee operates 
management believes it has used information that was reasonably obtainable in order to complete its valuation process and determine if the company s investments in ars had incurred any temporary and or other than temporary impairment as of january  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commercial commitments as referenced in the tables below  the company has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the company 
based on management s review of the terms and conditions of its contractual obligations and commercial commitments  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  the commercial obligations and commitments made by the company are customary transactions  which are similar to those of other comparable retail companies 
the operating lease obligations shown in the table below represent future cash payments to landlords required to fulfill the company s minimum rent requirements 
such amounts are actual cash requirements by year and are not reported net of any tenant improvement allowances received from landlords 
the following tables identify the material obligations and commitments as of january  payments due by period contractual obligations dollar amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt purchase obligations deferred compensation operating leases total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments dollar amounts in thousands total amounts committed less than year years years after years lines of credit total commercial commitments the company has available an unsecured line of credit of million  of which million is available for letters of credit  which is excluded from the preceding table 
certain merchandise purchase orders require that the company open letters of credit 
when the company takes possession of the merchandise  it releases payment on the letters of credit 
the amounts of outstanding letters of credit reported reflect the open letters of credit on merchandise ordered  but not yet received or funded 
the company believes it has sufficient credit available to open letters of credit for merchandise purchases 
there were no bank borrowings during fiscal   and the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality and inflation the company s business is seasonal  with the holiday season from approximately november to december and the back to school season from approximately july to september historically contributing the greatest volume of net sales 
for fiscal years   and  the holiday and back to school seasons accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s fiscal year net sales 
although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
quarterly results may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including the timing and amount of sales and costs associated with the opening of new stores  the timing and level of markdowns  the timing of store closings  the remodeling of existing stores  competitive factors  and general economic conditions
