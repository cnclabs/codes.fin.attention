financial overview for the year ended december   our revenue increased by million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the comparable period in included in this change in revenue is a reduction of approximately million from the impact of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and other foreign currencies 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange  revenue increased by million  or 
revenues from the scientific instruments segment increased modestly on a currency adjusted basis  increasing by million  or  to  million 
revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects higher sales of mass spectrometry systems offset by lower sales of x ray and optical emission spectroscopy systems 
the mix of products sold in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in revenues from academic and government customers offset by lower sales to industrial customers 
we attribute the increases in spending by academic and government customers to new product introductions and stimulus packages implemented by governments of various countries  including the us  germany  japan and china 
we expect that we will continue to receive stimulus related orders through and these orders will be recognized in revenue into the first half of we attribute the overall decreases in spending by industrial customers to the worldwide recession 
however  revenues from industrial customers improved quarter over quarter and sequentially for the third and fourth quarters of and we believe this reflects a gradual turnaround in the recent trends for these markets 
we are cautiously optimistic that the industrial markets we serve will continue to improve through but we will continue to closely monitor the apparent recovery in these markets 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million  resulting in an operating margin of  compared to income from operations of million  resulting in an operating margin of  for the comparable period in the operating margin in includes million of acquisition related charges and the operating margin in includes million of acquisition related charges 
excluding the effect of these acquisition related charges  income from operations increased by million 
the increase in operating margin is primarily the result of an improvement in our gross profit margins and lower operating expenses 
our gross profit margin for the 
table of contents year ended december  was  compared with for the comparable period in higher gross profit margins on our newly introduced mass spectrometry products  combined with productivity initiatives  the benefits of cost cutting and changes in foreign currency exchange rates allowed us to improve our gross profit margins without a significant increase in volume 
we reduced our operating expenses through various cost reduction programs 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted our operating expenses 
we incurred approximately million of interest expense during the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in of the total interest expense incurred during the year ended december   approximately million related to a credit facility that we entered into during the first quarter of we initially borrowed million under this credit facility in order to finance the acquisition of bruker biospin 
in  we repaid approximately million of the amounts outstanding under this credit agreement and  from the inception of this credit agreement  we have reduced the net amount outstanding by approximately million 
during the year ended december   we recorded net losses on foreign currency transactions of million compared to net losses of million for the comparable period in we incurred million of foreign exchange losses in the first three months of that were driven by the re measurement of certain foreign currency denominated assets  principally cash  inter company receivables and a short term inter company loan  into the functional currency of the affected entities 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to in our tax rate can vary from year to year as the amount and mix of income and taxes outside of the us changes 
our tax rate also varies as a result of discrete items that are of a non recurring nature 
in the second half of  we repatriated cash from certain foreign locations into the us in order to reduce our outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
this repatriation  and certain other transactions that were taxable in the united states  resulted in approximately million of tax expense 
excluding this amount  our tax rate for the year would have been 
additionally  our tax rate for includes tax benefits of million related to reversing certain valuation allowances and reaching the more likely than not threshold for recognizing certain tax receivables 
the tax benefits recorded in described above were offset by million of income taxes incurred in connection with the liquidation of a legal entity within the scientific instruments segment 
excluding the million of net tax benefits described above  our tax rate for the year would have been 
our net income attributable to the shareholders of bruker corporation for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the comparable period in critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets  warranty costs and derivative financial instruments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
table of contents value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally are transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured  such as when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the relative fair value of the elements  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is typically determined by referencing the prices charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in an arrangement  but no such evidence for the delivered items  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
changes in our ability to establish the fair value for each element in multiple element arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we also have contracts for which we apply the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition 
application of the percentage of completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract 
changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
grant revenue is recognized when we complete the services required under the grant 
income taxes 
the determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the deductions  carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary 
in addition  we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits  tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to operations 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain international subsidiaries 
we record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non saleable or non refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers 
we consider our demonstration units to be available for sale 
we reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value  taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months  expected demand  technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in additional charges to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill is impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method 
estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgments by management about the future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we also review finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale based on historical warranty rates and our assumptions of future warranty claims 
the warranty accrual is included as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
although our products undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
derivative financial instruments 
all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense

we attribute the overall decreases in spending by industrial customers to the worldwide recession 
revenues from the energy supercon technologies segment increased  on a currency adjusted basis  by million  or 
the increase in revenue  excluding the effect of foreign exchange  is attributable to the acquisition of the research instruments business offset in part by lower demand for certain types of superconducting wire 
cost of revenue our cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december   was million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  compared to cost of product and service revenue of million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  for the comparable period in higher gross profit margins on certain nuclear magnetic resonance products and our newly introduced mass spectrometry products  combined with productivity initiatives  the benefits of cost cutting and changes in foreign currency exchange rates allowed us to improve our gross profit margins without a significant increase in volume 
while product mix and initiatives designed to increase gross profits drove the increase in gross profit margins  the installation of the gigahertz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer in the fourth quarter of also contributed approximately to the year over year improvement in gross profit margin 
because of the high degree of risk associated with the gigahertz project  the majority of costs incurred in connection with this project were charged to research and development expense as incurred  rather than capitalized as inventory 
as a result  the sale carried gross profit margins that were significantly higher than those of our other nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of product and service revenue  from million  or of product and service revenue  for the comparable period in the increase in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to increases in headcount in support of planned revenue growth and as a result of certain acquisitions 
increases in sales and marketing expenses were offset  in part  by cost saving initiatives and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
general and administrative our general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million  or of product and service revenue  from million  or of product and service revenue  for the comparable period in the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily a function of various cost saving initiatives and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 

table of contents research and development our research and development expense for the year ended december  decreased to million  or of product and service revenue  from million  or of product and service revenue  for the comparable period in the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  as a majority of our research and development is performed in europe 
cost saving initiatives in certain areas of our research and development organization also contributed to the decrease 
however  we also continued to make incremental investments in research and development that we believe will generate future growth 
restructuring charges income from operations for was below management s expectations and  as a result  we began implementing cost savings programs throughout our organization 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of restructuring charges primarily in connection with a restructuring of certain operations in the netherlands 
approximately million of the restructuring charges related to an involuntary severance program which affected approximately employees 
the balance of the restructuring charge related to the termination of certain leases 
the impact of this program reduced the number of employees in sales and marketing and research and development and consolidated and focused the selling and development efforts of our single crystal x ray diffraction products 
acquisition related charges  net of bargain purchase acquisition related charges of million recorded in relate entirely to the energy supercon technologies segment and consist of a bargain purchase gain of million recorded in connection with the acquisition of the research instruments business from varian medical systems  inc which was more than offset by million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and million of impairment charges associated with fixed assets used in the production of certain superconducting wire 
acquisition related charges of million recorded in relate entirely to the scientific instruments segment and consist of transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of bruker biospin 
the acquisition of bruker biospin represented a combination of companies under common control due to a majority of ownership of both bruker corporation and bruker biospin by the same individuals and  as a result  transaction costs were expensed as incurred 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net during the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the comparable period of during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  consisted of net interest expense of million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of million 
during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  were realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of million and net interest expense of million 
the losses on foreign currency transactions in resulted from the re measurement of certain foreign currency denominated assets  principally cash  inter company receivables and a short term inter company loan into the functional currency of the affected entities 
we implemented various programs to reduce our exposure from re measurement of foreign currencies 
these programs contributed to the decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions

discrete items impacting the provision for income taxes in included tax benefits of million and related primarily to reversing certain valuation allowances and reaching the more likely than not threshold for recognizing certain tax receivables 
the tax benefits described were offset by million of income taxes incurred in connection with the liquidation of a tax ineffective entity within the scientific instruments segment 
in addition  acquisition related costs did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they were incurred primarily in the us and foreign currency exchange losses did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they occurred in foreign locations with relatively low statutory tax rates

the adoption of codification topic no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
accounting standards update will require new disclosures about transfers in and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy and activity  including purchases  sales  issuances and settlements  in level fair value measurements 
the requirements of accounting standards update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in level fair value measurements which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact that the additional disclosure requirements will have on our results of operations and financial position and when we will adopt these requirements

table of contents in september  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on fasb accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb accounting standards update addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic no 
 revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  principally europe and japan  which subjects our operations to the exposure of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
our foreign exchange gains losses  net were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
from time to time  we have entered into foreign currency contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in exchange rates have on our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and in the future may utilize foreign currency contracts more frequently as part of a transactional hedging program 
impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in short term investments that are subject to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal because of our policy of investing in short term financial instruments issued by highly rated financial institutions 

table of contents our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective we entered into an interest rate swap 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in interest expense 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to pay a fixed rate of approximately and receive a variable rate based on three month libor through december  the initial notional amount of this interest swap was million and amortizes in proportion to the term debt component of our credit agreement 
at december   the outstanding notional amount of this swap was million 
we have determined that this swap is an effective hedge of the variability of cash flows of the interest payments 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
