item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction  for a further discussion of the current strategy for integrys energy services 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
integrys energy group uses derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options  and swaps  to manage its commodity and financial market risks 
significant volatility in energy prices could adversely impact integrys energy group s cash collateral requirements due to counterparty margin calls related to these instruments 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of derivative contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
furthermore  realized values could differ from values determined by management 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see note  risk management activities 
poor investment performance of retirement plan investments and other factors impacting retirement plan costs could unfavorably impact integrys energy group s liquidity and results of operations 
integrys energy group has employee benefit plans that cover substantially all of its employees and retirees 
integrys energy group s cost of providing these benefit plans is dependent upon actual plan experience and assumptions concerning the future  such as earnings on and or valuations of plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation  and required or voluntary contributions to the plans 
depending upon the investment performance over time and other factors impacting its costs as listed above  integrys energy group could be required to make larger contributions in the future to fund these plans 
these additional funding obligations could have a material adverse impact on integrys energy group s cash flows  financial condition  and or results of operations 
changes made to the plans may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
fluctuating commodity prices may reduce energy margins 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas margins are sensitive to changes in natural gas commodity prices 
any changes could affect the prices the regulated natural gas utilities charge  their operating costs  and the competitive position of their products and services 
prudently incurred costs for purchased natural gas and pipeline transportation and storage services are fully recoverable through the annual reconciliation of revenues from the natural gas charge 
however  increases in natural gas costs affect total retail prices and  therefore  the competitive position of integrys energy group s natural gas businesses relative to other forms of energy 
in addition  the timing and extent of higher natural gas prices can adversely affect accounts receivable  bad debts  fuel cost  and interest expense 
integrys energy group is also subject to margin requirements in connection with its use of forward contracts  and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely relative to these positions 
integrys energy group s regulated electric utility margins are directly affected by commodity costs related to coal  natural gas  and other fuels used in the electric generation process 
integrys energy group may experience increased expenses  including interest costs and bad debts  higher working capital requirements  and possibly reduction in demand as a result of any increase in the cost of fuel or purchased power 
higher commodity prices result in increased energy prices that may impact customer demand for energy in the nonregulated market and increase counterparty and bad debt risk 
this may stress margins at integrys energy group s nonregulated subsidiaries 
if market prices for electric energy decline below the cost of production at integrys energy group s nonregulated generation facilities  these units may be temporarily shut down 
counterparties and customers may not meet their obligations 
integrys energy group is exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe integrys energy group money  energy  natural gas  coal  or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  integrys energy group might be forced to replace or to sell the underlying commitment at then current market prices 
in such event  integrys energy group might incur losses  or its results of operations  financial position  or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 
some of integrys energy group s customers are experiencing  or may experience  financial problems that could have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
integrys energy group cannot provide assurance that its financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to integrys energy group and that such a default will not have a material adverse impact on integrys energy group s business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
furthermore  the bankruptcy of one or more of its customers  or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint  might make it unlikely that integrys energy group would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by distressed entities or residential customers 
such events could adversely impact integrys energy group s receivable collections and additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect its operating results 
in addition  such events might force customers to reduce or curtail their future use of integrys energy group s products and services  which could have a material adverse impact on integrys energy group s results of operations and financial condition 
any change in integrys energy group s ability to sell electricity generated from its facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized certain of integrys energy group s subsidiaries to sell generation from certain of its facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw this market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that integrys energy group or its subsidiaries possess market power  or that they are not charging just and reasonable rates  the ferc may require integrys energy group s subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
integrys energy group s revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates it may receive 
integrys energy group has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results 
the pec merger and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in minnesota and michigan were accounted for as purchases by integrys energy group in accordance with gaap 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition and added to those of integrys energy group 
as a result of the application of purchase accounting  these transactions resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired  integrys energy group may be required to incur material noncash charges relating to such impairments 
such impairment charges could have a material impact on the financial results of integrys energy group 
actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare integrys energy group s financial statements 
in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
for more information about significant estimates and assumptions  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
integrys energy group may not be able to utilize tax credit and or net operating loss carryforwards 
integrys energy group has significantly reduced its consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits and tax net operating losses available under the applicable tax codes 
integrys energy group has not fully utilized these tax credits and tax net operating losses in its previous tax filings  but expects to prior to their expiration in future filings 
however  integrys energy group may not be able to fully utilize the tax credits and tax net operating losses available as carryforwards if its future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit the use of such credits and losses 
in addition  any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits or tax net operating losses as a result of legislative change or adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect integrys energy group s tax obligations 
integrys energy group is subject to provisions that can limit merger and acquisition opportunities for its shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law precludes the acquisition of or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility consumers  investors and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares 
provisions of integrys energy group s articles of incorporation and by laws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving integrys energy group that is not approved by its board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that such events may be beneficial to integrys energy group s interests 
in addition  the wisconsin business corporation law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult attempts by others to obtain control of integrys energy group without the approval of its board of directors

dividend restrictions integrys energy group is a holding company and its ability to pay dividends is largely dependant upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the pscw has restricted wps to paying normal dividends on its common stock of no more than of the previous year s common stock dividend 
integrys energy group s right to receive dividends on the common stock of wps is also subject to the prior rights of wps s preferred shareholders and to provisions in wps s restated articles of incorporation  which limit the amount of common stock dividends that wps may pay if its common stock and common stock surplus accounts constitute less than of its total capitalization 
these limitations are not expected to limit any dividend payments in the foreseeable future 
at december   these limitations amounted to million out of wps s total retained earnings of million 
consequently  at december   wps had million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends 
the pscw also requires wps to maintain a financial capital structure ie  the percentages by which each of common stock equity  preferred stock equity and debt constitute the total capital invested in a utility  that has a common equity range of to 
the pscw also established a targeted financial common equity ratio at that results in a regulatory common equity ratio of

earnings at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased million  driven by a million increase in after tax non cash goodwill impairment losses period over period 
a million after tax decrease in margin from lower period over period volumes  net of decoupling  also negatively impacted earnings 
an million after tax increase in employee benefit costs  a million after tax increase in other operating and maintenance expenses related primarily to natural gas maintenance costs and workers compensation claims  and million after tax of restructuring costs related to workforce reductions also contributed to the decrease in earnings 
these negative impacts were partially offset by a million after tax net positive impact that increased rates at certain natural gas utilities had on margin and a million after tax decrease in bad debt expense 
earnings at the regulated electric utility segment decreased million  driven by a million after tax increase in operating expenses  including restructuring costs  a million after tax increase in other expense primarily related to an increase in interest expense at wps  and a million increase in income taxes 
partially offsetting these increases in expenses was a million after tax increase in margin 
earnings at integrys energy services increased million  driven by a million after tax increase in integrys energy services margin year over year  primarily related to the positive year over year impact of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods  partially offset by non cash accounting losses due to derivative fair value adjustments 
partially offsetting the increase in integrys energy services margin were an increase in the provision for income taxes  primarily due to an million year over year decrease in income tax credits recognized  after tax restructuring expenses of million  after tax losses of million related to dispositions completed in connection with the strategy change primarily driven by timing differences caused by the accounting treatment for derivative and non derivative contracts  and an after tax increase in operating and maintenance expenses of million

from to  earnings related to pgl and nsg increased million 
also positively impacting earnings was an increase in natural gas sales volumes at wps  merc  and mgu  which drove a million after tax increase in margin 
earnings at the regulated electric utility segment increased million  driven by a million after tax decrease in electric maintenance expenses  an approximate million after tax positive impact related to retail electric rate increases  and an approximate million after tax increase in wholesale margins  partially offset by an million after tax increase in electric transmission expenses and an approximate million after tax decrease in margin due to lower residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes as a result of cooler weather during the cooling season and customer conservation efforts 
earnings at integrys energy services decreased million  driven by a million after tax decrease in integrys energy services margin year over year  primarily related to non cash accounting losses due to derivative fair value and inventory valuation adjustments  partially offset by an increase in retail electric margin 
also contributing to the decrease in integrys energy services earnings was a million after tax increase in operating and maintenance expenses  the year over year impact of the recognition of million of after tax earnings from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel production facility in  and a million decrease in after tax income from discontinued operations as a result of the sale of niagara generation  llc in partially offsetting the decrease in earnings was the recognition of million of investment tax credits related to solar projects completed in the fourth quarter of earnings at the oil and natural gas operations segment decreased million 
in connection with the pec merger  integrys energy group announced its intent to divest of pec s oil and natural gas production operations  pep 
pep was sold in the third quarter of in  pep recognized earnings of million  including million of earnings reported as discontinued operations 
the sale of pep resulted in a million after tax gain in earnings at the electric transmission investment segment increased million year over year  due to an increase in income from integrys energy group s ownership interest in atc

not meaningful as the pec merger was completed on february  compared with revenues regulated natural gas utility segment revenue decreased million  driven by an approximate million decrease in revenue as a result of an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold by the regulated natural gas utilities during compared with for all of integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utilities  prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates 
an approximate million decrease in revenue as a result of lower year over year natural gas throughput volumes  driven by an approximate million decrease related to lower overall volumes  including residential customer volumes  resulting from customer conservation and efficiency efforts 
lower volumes were also driven by decreased commercial and industrial customer volumes resulting from reduced demand related to changes in customers plant operations and a decline in customer base at pgl and mgu  both of which integrys energy group attributed to the general economic slowdown 
an approximate million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season as indicated by the decrease in average heating degree days 
an approximate million decrease related to a reduction in volumes sold to the electric utility segment driven by the availability of lower cost power from miso  resulting in a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units 
this decrease in revenue was partially offset by the million positive impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for pgl and nsg on march   and for wps on january  under decoupling  these utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction 
an approximate million year over year net decrease in revenue from lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at pgl and nsg related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by higher recovery of eep expenses 
the eep program was established in the pgl and nsg rate cases and is designed to encourage energy efficiency initiatives 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by the approximate million year over year net positive impact of natural gas distribution rate cases and changes in rate design at the regulated natural gas utilities 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on these rate cases 
effective january   mgu received a final rate order from the mpsc for a natural gas distribution rate increase 
on june   merc received a final rate order granting a natural gas distribution rate increase 
prior to this final order  merc had been granted interim rate relief effective october  together  these rate increases had an approximate million positive impact on revenue 
in  pgl and nsg received the full impact of their natural gas distribution rate orders  which were effective february   and drove an approximate million increase in revenue year over year 
effective january   the pscw required wps to change its retail natural gas distribution rate design which incorporates higher volumetric rates and lower fixed customer charges 
in  revenue increased approximately million related to this change in rate design 
margins regulated natural gas utility segment margin decreased million  driven by an approximate million year over year decrease in margin resulting from the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes attributed to the negative impact of the general economic slowdown  customer conservation and efficiency efforts  and warmer year over year weather 
this decrease in margin includes the impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for pgl and nsg on march   and for wps on january  the decoupling mechanism for wps s natural gas utility includes an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
approximately million of additional margin was recognized at wps due to a shortfall from the rate case authorized margin during an approximate million year over year net decrease in margin due to lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at pgl and nsg related to former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in recovery of eep expenses 
this decrease in margin was offset by a net decrease in operating expense from both the amortization of the related regulatory asset and eep expenses and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
an approximate million year over year decrease in margin at mgu related to an adjustment in the third quarter of for recovery of prior natural gas costs in a mpsc proceeding 
the decrease in margin was partially offset by the approximate million net positive year over year impact of rate orders and impacts of rate design changes at the regulated natural gas utilities 
operating income loss operating results at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased million  from operating income of million in  to an operating loss of million in this decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in non cash goodwill impairment losses of million and the million decrease in natural gas margin  partially offset by a million decrease in other operating expenses 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for information related to the goodwill impairment losses recorded in and the year over year decrease in other operating expenses primarily related to an approximate million net decrease in amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures of manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in eep expenses 
both of these costs were recovered from customers in rates 
a million decrease in bad debt expense driven by the impact lower energy prices had on overall accounts receivable balances and the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at pgl  nsg  and mgu 
pgl and nsg elected during the third quarter of  under a new illinois state law  to file for recovery from or refund to customers the difference between actual bad debt expense reported as a component of earnings and the bad debt expense included in utility rates retroactive to january  bad debt expense also decreased as a result of mgu s rate order effective january   which established a bad debt expense tracking mechanism that allows for the deferral and subsequent recovery or refund of of the difference between actual bad debt write offs net of recoveries and bad debt expense included in utility rates 
the bad debt mechanism allowed recovery of a portion of the december  accounts receivable reserve representing future bad debt write offs 
the decrease in bad debt expense attributed to the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at the natural gas utilities was million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employee benefit costs  partially related to an increase in pension expense resulting from negative pension investment returns in  as well as higher health care related expenses in restructuring expenses of million related to a reduction in workforce 
see note  restructuring expense  for more information 
a million increase in natural gas maintenance costs  primarily related to increased system inspection and maintenance requirements 
a million increase in expenses related to workers compensation claims 
a million charge related to an expected settlement at pgl and nsg 
a million increase in amortization of a regulatory asset related to conservation program initiatives 
compared with revenues regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased million  driven by a combined increase in pgl and nsg natural gas utility revenue of million  from  million during  to  million during the increase in revenue at both of these natural gas utilities was driven primarily by the fact that they were not included in regulated natural gas utility results until after the pec merger on february  other factors that contributed to this combined increase include pgl s annualized rate increase effective february   which increased revenue year over year by approximately million 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the pgl and nsg rate cases 
higher year over year natural gas prices 
increases in natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in rates 
colder weather during the heating season  partially offset by energy conservation efforts by natural gas utility customers and a larger number of customer disconnections  which integrys energy group believes resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy 
an increase in natural gas revenue of million at the remaining natural gas utilities wps  merc  and mgu from million during  to  million during  which resulted primarily from a combined million increase in revenue driven by the approximate increase in the per unit cost of natural gas in compared with a million increase in revenue from colder weather during the heating season compared with  evidenced by an approximate year over year increase in heating degree days across these three utilities 
an increase in revenue from merc s interim rate increase  effective october   for retail natural gas customers 
the combined increase in revenue at wps  mgu  and merc  was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue driven by a decrease in year over year volumes normalized for the impact of weather  million of which was driven by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold by wps to its electric utility segment 
the decrease in volumes sold to the electric utility segment was a result of a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units during the summer cooling season because of cooler year over year weather 
additional electricity was also available within the electric utility segment from weston  a coal fired generating facility that became commercially operational in june the remaining decrease in weather normalized volumes was driven by energy conservation efforts of residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year  which integrys energy group believes resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy 
margins regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased million  primarily due to an increase in the combined margin at pgl and nsg of million  from million in to million in the increase in combined margin was driven by the acquisition of pgl and nsg on february  the combined operations for the entire heating season were included in the natural gas utility margin 
however  only operations from the merger date through december   were included in the natural gas utility margin 
due to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities  higher margins are generally derived during the heating season first and fourth quarters 
the rate increase for pgl which resulted in an approximate million increase in margin 
colder than normal weather experienced by both pgl and nsg resulted in an approximate million increase in margin before the decoupling mechanism went into effect on march  an increase in natural gas margin of million at the remaining natural gas utilities wps  merc  and mgu  primarily driven by a combined increase in natural gas throughput volumes at wps  merc  and mgu  which had an approximate million positive impact on natural gas utility margins 
colder year over year weather had an approximate million positive impact on margins 
partially offsetting the positive impact of colder weather  were energy conservation efforts by residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year  which had an approximate million negative impact on margins 
the interim rate increase for merc  effective october   which had a positive impact on natural gas margin 
an approximate million year over year increase in margin at mgu related to an adjustment for recovery of prior natural gas costs in an mpsc proceeding 
operating income operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased million  driven by the million increase in the natural gas utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in combined operating expenses at pgl and nsg of million  from million for to million for the increase in operating expenses related to pgl and nsg was primarily driven by the acquisition of these natural gas utilities on february  as a result  operating expenses for the period january  to the acquisition date were not included in the operating results 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in the second quarter of related to nsg 
a combined increase in bad debt expense  driven by the impact of high energy prices and worsening economic conditions on overall accounts receivable balances 
other expense other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense  partially offset by a million increase in miscellaneous income 
the increase in other expense was a result of a million increase in combined interest expense at pgl and nsg  from million in to million in the increase in interest expense at pgl and nsg is primarily due to the fact that these utilities were first acquired on february   and  therefore  did not recognize a full year of interest expense in the increase in interest expense was also due to additional long term debt borrowings and higher interest rates on new and remarketed long term debt 
the increase in other expense was offset by a million increase in afudc at wps related to the construction of natural gas laterals for connection to the guardian ii pipeline 
a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in short term borrowing levels and a decrease in interest rates for wps s natural gas segment

the primary drivers of the decrease were an approximate million year over year decrease due to lower demand related to changes in commercial and industrial customers plant operations  which integrys energy group attributed mainly to the general economic slowdown 
an approximate million decrease primarily related to cooler year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the decrease in cooling degree days at both wps and uppco 
these decreases in volumes were partially offset by the million impact that decoupling  which went into effect on january   had on wps s revenue 
under decoupling  wps is allowed to defer the difference between its actual margin and the rate case authorized margin recognized from residential and small commercial and industrial customers 
this four year pilot program for electric decoupling has an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
this cap was reached during the second quarter of  therefore  no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the second half of the year 
an approximate million year over year reduction in revenue related to refunds due to customers in both and related to wps s over collection of fuel costs 
on april   the pscw made fuel cost recovery subject to refund  effective april   as actual and projected fuel costs for the remainder of the year were estimated to be below the fuel window 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on wps s fuel window 
an approximate million year over year decrease in opportunity sales driven by lower demand and the availability of lower cost power from the miso market 
these decreases in regulated electric utility segment revenue were partially offset by an approximate million increase driven by higher wholesale volumes due to an increase in contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate  effective january   to recover costs related to weston an approximate million increase in revenue from the combined effect of the july  fuel surcharge  a portion of which was incorporated into wps s non fuel base retail electric rates  and the full year s benefit of the retail electric rate increase  effective january   for wps 
margins the regulated electric utility segment margin increased million  driven by an approximate million year over year increase in margin from wholesale customers related to increases in contracted sales volumes with an existing customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate  effective january   to recover costs related to weston an approximate million year over year increase in margin from the combined effect of the july  fuel surcharge  a portion of which was incorporated into wps s non fuel base retail electric rates  and the full year s benefit of the retail electric rate increase  effective january   for wps 
an approximate million year over year increase in wps s regulated electric utility margin due to fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million lower than what was recovered in rates during  compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million lower than what was recovered in rates during the increase in margin was partially offset by an approximate million year over year decrease in margin  after the impact of the wps decoupling mechanism  caused by a year over year decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers 
the million impact of decoupling partially offset the approximate million decrease in margin due to lower sales volumes  which was attributed to the general economic slowdown and cooler year over year weather during the cooling season 
operating income operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased million  driven by the million increase in margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was driven by million in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce 
see note  restructuring expense  for more information 
an million increase in electric maintenance expenses at wps  primarily related to a greater number of planned outages at the generation plants during  compared with an million increase in employee benefit costs  primarily related to an increase in pension expense driven partially by negative pension investment returns in  as well as higher health care related expenses in a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense at wps  primarily related to weston being placed in service for accounting purposes in april other expense other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense  primarily related to increased long term borrowings at wps in december the additional borrowings were utilized to fund various construction projects  most notably the crane creek wind generation project in iowa 
a million decrease in interest earned on the transmission facilities wps funded on atc s behalf 
wps was reimbursed by atc for these transmission facilities in april compared with revenues regulated electric utility segment revenue increased million  driven by a increase in electric sales volumes  which resulted in an approximate million increase in revenue year over year  related to an increase in wholesale volumes year over year  which drove an approximate million increase in revenue 
there was an approximate million increase in opportunity sales year over year as the electric utility had more low cost generation with weston becoming commercially operational in  combined with available capacity from lower sales volumes to residential customers 
in addition  wps experienced an approximate million increase in wholesale revenue  driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year 
the increase in revenue related to wholesale volumes was partially offset by a decrease in residential sales volumes and a decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes year over year  which drove an approximate million decrease in revenue 
of this decrease in revenue  approximately million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers  which is believed to be the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown 
approximately million related to decreased demand by commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of as the economy weakened 
in addition  cooler weather during the cooling season compared with contributed approximately million to the decrease in revenue 
an interim fuel surcharge approved by the pscw for wps s retail electric customers effective march   related to higher fuel and purchased power costs 
in addition  a surcharge increase was approved by the pscw effective july  both orders combined had an overall impact on revenue of approximately million 
contributing factors in this rate change were increased purchased power costs due to lower than expected generation from the new weston power plant during the start up phases  increased coal and coal transportation costs  and increased natural gas costs 
on september   the pscw reopened the fuel surcharge to review forecasted fuel costs as wps s current and anticipated annual fuel costs were below those projected in the fuel surcharge 
as a result of these lower costs  wps accrued at december   a refund payable in to its electric customers of approximately million  which is excluded from the million noted above 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on wps s interim fuel surcharges 
a retail electric rate increase  effective january   which contributed an approximate million increase in revenue 
the full benefit of the retail electric rate increase  effective january   also contributed to the increase in revenue year over year 
per the pscw s order approving the pec merger  wps was not permitted to increase its base rates for natural gas or electric service prior to january  however  wps was allowed to adjust rates for changes in purchased power costs as well as fuel costs related to electric generation due to changes in nymex natural gas futures prices  delivered coal prices  and transmission costs 
the increase also included recovery of deferred and miso day costs over a one year period 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on wps s rate increase 
an approximate million increase in revenue at uppco related to increased energy and transmission costs in compared with increases in fuel and purchased power costs at uppco are passed directly through to customers in rates 
margins the regulated electric utility segment margin increased million  driven by an increase in electric margin at wps 
the million increase in the electric margin at wps was a result of a million partial refund to wisconsin retail customers in for their portion of proceeds from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in the margin related to the refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense in and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
wps completed this refund in an approximate million increase in margin from the retail electric rate increase effective january   and the full benefit of the retail electric rate increase effective january  an approximate million increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year 
an approximate million increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million lower than what was recovered in rates during  compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million higher than what was recovered in rates during as a result of approximately million of under recovered fuel and purchased power costs in the first quarter of  the pscw approved an interim rate surcharge effective march   and subsequently approved a higher final surcharge effective july  the million increase in electric margin includes lower fuel costs from the fuel window reset and the net impact of the refund accrued at december   payable in to electric customers from the reopening of the fuel surcharge on september   by the pscw 
these increases in the electric margin were partially offset by an approximate million decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes 
of this decrease  approximately million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers  which is believed to be the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown 
approximately million related to decreased demand by commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of as the economy worsened 
in addition  cooler weather during the cooling season compared with contributed approximately million to the decrease in gross margin 
operating income operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased million  driven by the million increase in the electric utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was driven by a million year over year increase related to the partial amortization in of the regulatory liability previously recorded for wps s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wisconsin retail electric ratepayers 
a million increase in electric transmission expenses  primarily related to higher rates charged by miso and atc due to additional transmission costs 
a million increase in cost of capital and depreciation expense charged by ibs for assets transferred from wps to ibs in the beginning of and reported as operating and maintenance expense in similar costs were reported as depreciation and amortization expense in  prior to the start up of ibs 
a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to million of depreciation expense from weston being placed in service for accounting purposes in april  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to assets transferred to ibs and reported in operating and maintenance expense in these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by an million decrease in electric maintenance expenses at wps  primarily due to major planned outages at the weston and weston generation stations  the de pere energy center  and the pulliam generation station  as well as several unplanned outages at the weston generation station in  compared with fewer outages in a decrease in external costs to achieve merger synergies of million related to the merger with pec  from million in  to million in this decrease occurred primarily because all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from july through march were reallocated in from the holding company segment to the other reportable segments  including the regulated electric segment 
these reportable segments are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve merger synergies 
in addition  the reduction in external costs to achieve merger synergies was due to less integration work required in compared with other expense other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense and a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
the increase in interest expense was due to higher long term borrowings at wps  primarily utilized to fund various construction projects and to retire short term borrowing levels related to construction 
the decrease in miscellaneous income was driven by a million decrease in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities wps funded on atc s behalf related to weston wps was reimbursed for these transmission facilities by atc in april a million gain on the sale of a generation facility by uppco in july the decrease in miscellaneous income was partially offset by an increase in afudc related to the wind generation project

lower sales volumes  as wholesale transactions were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of  and continue to be scaled back with integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas and electric businesses 
see introduction above and note  dispositions  for a discussion of the current strategy for integrys energy services 
margins changes in commodity prices subject a portion of the nonregulated operations to earnings volatility  driven primarily by its wholesale trading and marketing operations 
integrys energy services uses financial instruments to economically hedge risks associated with physical transactions 
the financial instruments essentially lock in margin on these transactions by mitigating the impact of fluctuations in market conditions  changing commodity prices  volumetric exposure  and other associated risks 
because many of the derivative instruments utilized in these transactions may not qualify  or are not designated  as hedges under gaap  reported earnings for the integrys energy services segment includes changes in the fair values of many of the derivative instruments 
these values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as unrealized gains or losses within margin 
fluctuations in the fair value of the nonderivative instruments such as certain customer contracts  as well as natural gas storage and transportation contracts do not impact margin until settlement  as these transactions do not meet the gaap definition of derivative instruments 
integrys energy services margins increased million in  compared with the significant items contributing to the change in margin were as follows electric and other margins integrys energy services electric and other margins increased million during  compared with the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services electric and other margins 
realized wholesale electric margin realized wholesale electric margin increased million  from million during  to million during wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of and continue to be scaled back with integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale electric business 
see introduction above and note  dispositions  for a discussion of the current strategy for integrys energy services 
in general  realized margins are impacted by transaction activity in prior periods  as integrys energy services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle  which typically occurs over a to month period from the time the contract was actually entered into 
in  realized margins benefited from the settlement of contracts that were entered into prior to the implementation of integrys energy services strategy change 
realized retail electric margin the realized retail electric margin increased million  from million in  to million in the increase was driven by a million increase in the more mature markets  such as illinois and new york  as integrys energy services realized the benefits of including higher capital costs in its pricing in the first half of the year 
a million increase from operations in the texas market 
this increase is a result of the positive year over year impact of lower ancillary service costs compared to the prior year and the effects of hurricane ike in the third quarter of hurricane ike disrupted the electric infrastructure in texas for a period of time  causing some of integrys energy services customers to be without electricity or buy only a fraction of their normal energy usage during that period 
retail and wholesale electric fair value adjustments integrys energy services margin from retail and wholesale electric fair value adjustments increased million  as it recognized million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in  compared with million of non cash unrealized gains during the non cash unrealized gains and losses resulted from the application of gaap derivative accounting rules to integrys energy services portfolio of electric customer supply contracts  requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value 
the fair value adjustments recorded in include margin reductions of million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchaser of the canadian electric power portfolio  as discussed in note  dispositions 
natural gas margins integrys energy services natural gas margins increased million in  compared with the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services natural gas margins 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the combined effect of lower of cost or market inventory write downs and withdrawals from storage of natural gas for which write downs had previously been recorded resulted in a million year over year increase in the natural gas margin 
the average market price of natural gas decreased approximately during and decreased approximately during  driving a positive year over year change in natural gas margins of million related to lower of cost or market inventory write downs 
these lower of cost or market inventory write downs were required to reflect natural gas in storage at the end of the period at its net realizable value  as required by gaap 
the natural gas withdrawn from storage and sold to customers in had a million lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods 
at december   natural gas inventory had a lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods of million 
other realized retail natural gas margins other realized retail natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in the increase was due to integrys energy services withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas during in order to improve its liquidity position  recognizing realized gains on these natural gas storage withdrawals 
also  per unit retail natural gas margins were higher period over period as more recently contracted sales commitments reflect increased business risk and financing costs in the pricing 
offsetting the increase was a decrease in integrys energy services natural gas sales volumes year over year 
integrys energy services significantly reduced the number of natural gas storage transactions entered into as integrys energy group implemented its strategy change for its nonregulated energy services business segment 
other realized wholesale natural gas margins other realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased million  from million in  to million in in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of  wholesale natural gas transactions were scaled back and continue to be scaled back with integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas business 
the reduced activity had a negative impact on realized margins in see introduction above  and note  dispositions  for a discussion of the current strategy for integrys energy services 
fair value adjustments fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily related to changes in the fair market value of contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with certain natural gas storage contracts  as well as basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts 
the fair value adjustments excluding lower of cost or market inventory adjustments drove a million decrease in natural gas margins as unrealized losses on these instruments were million during  compared with unrealized gains of million during the fair value adjustments recorded in include a net increase in margin of million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchasers of the wholesale natural gas marketing business and the canadian natural gas portfolio  as discussed in note  dispositions 
operating income loss integrys energy services operating income increased million year over year 
this increase resulted from the million increase in margin discussed above  partially offset by losses of million related to dispositions completed in connection with the strategy change  million of restructuring expenses  which included employee related costs  the write off of capitalized development costs related to software that will not be utilized because of the restructuring  and consulting and legal fees  a million increase in operating and maintenance expense  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to renewable energy asset additions 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by a one time million novation fee related to an agreement with a counterparty that enabled integrys energy services to consolidate certain wholesale financial and physical contracts that were previously entered into with multiple counterparties  allowing integrys energy services to reduce collateral support requirements 
see note  restructuring expense  for a discussion of restructuring charges 
compared with revenues revenues increased  million in compared with  primarily due to increased volumes in part due to the pec merger in and higher average sales prices in average sales prices rose in due to large market price increases from january  through june  market prices began to decline beginning in the third quarter of and continued to decline through the end of the year to levels below that of january  integrys energy services recognizes revenue at the time energy is delivered 
as a result  revenues at the end of the year were recognized based on the higher market prices from contracts entered into earlier in the year 
margins integrys energy services margin decreased million from to the significant items contributing to the change in margin were as follows electric and other margins integrys energy services electric and other margins decreased million from to the and electric and other margin included the negative impact of million and million  respectively  of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the pec merger 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services electric and other margins 
realized gains on structured origination contracts realized gains on structured origination transactions increased million  from million in to million in origination transactions are physical  customer based agreements with municipalities  merchant generators  cooperatives  and regulated utilities 
the increase was primarily due to growth in existing markets with an emphasis on structured transactions with small environmentally friendly generators 
all other realized wholesale electric margin all other realized wholesale electric margin decreased million from to in general  realized margins are impacted by trading activity in prior periods 
integrys energy services recognizes realized margins when the contracts actually settle  which can lag as much as to months from the time the contract was actually entered into 
the reduced volume of proprietary trading that began in reduced realized margins in realized retail electric margin the realized retail electric margin increased million from million in to million in the change was primarily due to the following an increase of million from operations in illinois due to the addition of new customers as a result of the pec merger  as well as a reduced impact from purchase accounting in a million increase due to expansion in the mid atlantic region and the resolution of certain regulatory issues in northern maine 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease from operations in texas 
this reduction was a result of higher ancillary costs in texas and the effects of hurricane ike  which disrupted the electric infrastructure in texas for a period of time  causing some of integrys energy services customers to be without electricity or take only a fraction of their normal load during that period 
retail and wholesale fair value adjustments from to  integrys energy services margin from electric retail and wholesale fair value adjustments decreased million  as it recognized million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in  compared with million of non cash unrealized gains during although energy prices rose approximately in the first half of  they declined approximately in the second half of the year  which led to the recognition of large non cash unrealized losses in on these electric customer supply contracts 
these unrealized losses turn around in future years as the contracts settle 
the mark to market activity also reflects increases in portfolio reserves in recognition of the increased risk of credit losses and reduced market liquidity 
finally  the mark to market activity was also negatively impacted as the short term cost of borrowing increased 
the discount rate is a component of the fair value of integrys energy services derivative portfolio and  therefore  increased interest rates resulted in a reduction in the fair value presented on the balance sheet 
in  energy prices increased  resulting in unrealized gains 
oil option activity oil option activity drove a million decrease in electric and other margins from to there was no activity related to these oil options in prior to  oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits 
however  companies can no longer generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as the provisions of section k of the internal revenue code expired effective december  as a result  integrys energy services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in liquidation of electric supply contract in the fourth quarter of  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine requested that integrys energy services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and at that time  integrys energy services recognized an million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
the replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in maine by million in there was no impact on electric margin in  resulting in a million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from to natural gas margins integrys energy services natural gas margins decreased million from to the and natural gas margins included the negative impact of million and million  respectively  of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the pec merger 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services natural gas margins 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which integrys energy services had acquired and injected earlier in  which resulted in a lower of cost or market inventory write down  as required by gaap 
this write down resulted in a million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from to the negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory write downs was offset by unrealized gains recognized in and on derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions see fair value adjustments below 
other realized natural gas margins other realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in  primarily related to realized gains on wholesale natural gas storage transactions 
in  integrys energy services increased its storage withdrawals which drove the year over year increase in other realized natural gas margins 
in addition  integrys energy services placed greater emphasis on structured wholesale natural gas transactions in in existing markets  which also contributed to the increase 
these structured transactions involve serving customers such as regulated utilities  pipelines  retail marketers  and other large end users of natural gas 
spot to forward differential integrys energy services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
integrys energy services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with contracts in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  integrys energy services experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
the natural gas storage cycle had a positive million impact on natural gas margins from to there was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in compared with a million positive impact in at december   the market value of natural gas in storage was not significantly different than the market value of future sales contracts related to the natural gas storage cycle 
fair value adjustments in  fair value adjustments drove a million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were million in  compared with unrealized gains of million in operating income loss operating income at integrys energy services decreased million year over year 
this decrease resulted primarily from the million decrease in margin discussed above 
in addition  operating and maintenance expense increased million  driven largely by a million increase in bad debt expense  million of which resulted from the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in the third quarter of  a million increase in broker commissions as a result of higher transaction volumes  and higher employee benefit costs 
other expense other expense at integrys energy services decreased million year over year

for purposes of this table  it is assumed that the current interest rates on variable rate debt will remain in effect until the debt matures 
energy supply contracts at integrys energy services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers 
the utility subsidiaries expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates

obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  other than the integrys energy group retirement plan  cannot be estimated beyond the table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of million at december   as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain 
integrys energy group anticipates incurring costs annually to remediate these sites  but management believes that any costs incurred for environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas plant operations that are not recoverable through contributions from other entities or from insurance carriers have been prudently incurred and are  therefore  recoverable through rates for wps  mgu  pgl  and nsg 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for more information about environmental liabilities 
in addition  the table does not reflect any payments for the december   liability related to uncertain tax positions  as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain

management believes integrys energy group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs 
in march  integrys energy group filed a shelf registration statement which allows it to publicly issue debt  equity  certain types of hybrid securities  and other financial instruments 
specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security 
under an existing shelf registration statement  wps may issue up to million of senior debt securities with amounts  prices  and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
in december  wps issued million of  year senior notes under this shelf registration statement 
other future considerations integrys energy services business segment strategy change at december   integrys energy group had completed a substantial portion of its previously announced strategy to divest of or significantly reduce the size of its nonregulated energy services business segment to a smaller segment with significantly reduced credit and collateral support requirements 
one of the remaining parts of the strategy change is the pending sale of the wholesale electric business  which is expected to close in the first half of integrys energy group has repositioned its nonregulated energy services business segment from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail markets across the united states and canada  to a focus on selected retail markets in the united states with the expectation that recurring customer based business will result in dependable cash and earnings contributions with a reduced risk and capital profile 
in addition  integrys energy services will continue to invest in energy assets with renewable attributes 
once fully implemented  integrys energy group expects its liquidity needs to decrease and expects to reduce its existing credit facilities 
integrys energy group may also use the proceeds from the sales of any portions of this business segment  as well as the return of invested capital  to reduce outstanding debt or invest in areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return to achieve the highest value for its shareholders

customer usage due to the general economic slowdown and the increased focus on energy efficiency  sales volumes excluding the impact of weather have been decreasing at the utilities 
in certain jurisdictions  decoupling mechanisms have been implemented  which allow utilities to adjust rates going forward to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between the actual and authorized margin per customer impact of variations in volumes 
the mechanisms do not adjust for changes in volume resulting from changes in customer count 
decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the icc on a four year trial basis for pgl and nsg  effective march  interveners  including the illinois attorney general  oppose decoupling and have appealed the icc s approval 
pgl and nsg are actively supporting the icc s decision to approve decoupling 
the pscw approved the implementation of decoupling on a four year trial basis  effective january   for wps s natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales 
this decoupling mechanism includes an annual million cap for electric service and an annual million cap for natural gas service 
the million cap for electric service was reached in the second quarter of on december   decoupling for uppco was approved for all customer groups by the mpsc effective january  mgu requested decoupling in its rate case filed in july the partial settlement approved in that rate case did not address the decoupling request 
therefore the request will be addressed by the mpsc through the normal rate case process  which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of in minnesota  the legislature required the mpuc to evaluate decoupling 
the mpuc is currently engaged in that process and has sought and received comments on decoupling mechanisms from utilities and interveners in minnesota 
uncollectible accounts the reserves for uncollectible accounts at integrys energy group reflect management s best estimate of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances 
the reserves are based on known troubled accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors  including the impacts of the economy  energy prices  and weather 
the impact of the weak economic environment could cause more accounts receivable to become uncollectible 
higher levels of uncollectible balances could negatively impact integrys energy group s results of operations and could result in higher working capital requirements 
recoveries or refunds under illinois senate bill sb and an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism uetm in michigan will affect bad debt expense as described in note  regulatory environment 
goodwill impairment testing integrys energy group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each april interim impairment tests are performed between required annual testing dates if certain conditions exist 
one of these conditions is a change in business climate  which may be evidenced by  among other things  a prolonged decline in a company s market capitalization below book value 
any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for more information on goodwill balances for integrys energy group s reporting units at december  climate change recently  efforts have been initiated to develop state and regional greenhouse gas programs  to create federal legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions  and to create national or state renewable portfolio standards 
some examples of these efforts are the waxman markey bill  which passed the united states house of representatives  the kerry boxer draft bill  which was introduced in the united states senate  and the wisconsin clean energy jobs act  which has been introduced in the wisconsin legislature to implement recommendations from the governor s global warming task force 
the wisconsin clean energy jobs act establishes statewide goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and requires certain actions  including an increased renewable portfolio standard  to meet those goals 
in addition  in april  the epa declared carbon dioxide and several other greenhouse gases to be a danger to public health and welfare  which is the first step towards the epa potentially regulating greenhouse gases under the clean air act 
a risk exists that such legislation or regulation will increase the cost of energy 
however  integrys energy group believes the capital expenditures being made at its generation units are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program and that future expenditures related to control of greenhouse gas emissions or renewable portfolio standards by its regulated electric utilities will be recoverable in rates 
integrys energy group will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions 
the majority of integrys energy group s generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper midwest region of the united states 
the same is true for the majority of our customers facilities 
the physical risks posed by climate change are not expected to be significant at this time 
ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available 
new laws in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
arra contains various provisions intended to stimulate the economy 
included in arra are several tax provisions that may affect the company 
most notably  a provision of arra provides integrys energy group with additional opportunities to claim tax deductions for bonus depreciation for certain assets placed in service during  extending the bonus depreciation period established by the economic stimulus act of the additional first year deduction for bonus depreciation is estimated to be approximately million 
other provisions of arra provide integrys energy group with elections to select among a production tax credit  an investment tax credit  or a federal grant for various renewable generating facilities that went into service in integrys energy group currently plans to take production tax credits on power generated by wind facilities  but is evaluating the other alternatives mentioned 
in february  wisconsin act was signed into law 
act contains various tax provisions intended to reduce wisconsin s current budget gap 
most notably  this act will require integrys energy group and its subsidiaries to file a wisconsin income tax return as a combined group 
as a result  all of integrys energy group s income became subject to apportionment and taxation in wisconsin beginning january  in the future  integrys energy group may experience higher or lower wisconsin income taxes depending on the mix and type of income 
in the short term  after the adjustment to deferred taxes at the time of the law change  this law is expected to generate a small benefit for integrys energy group 
property tax assessment on natural gas integrys energy group s natural gas retailers  including its five natural gas utilities  purchase storage services from pipeline companies on the pipelines interstate natural gas storage and transmission systems 
once a shipper delivers natural gas to the pipeline s system  that specific natural gas cannot be physically traced back to the shipper  and the physical location of that specific natural gas is not ascertainable 
some states tax natural gas as personal property and have recently sought to assess personal property tax obligations against natural gas quantities held as working gas in facilities located in their states 
because the pipeline does not have title to the working gas inventory in these facilities  the state imposes the tax on the shippers as of the assessment date  based on allocated quantities 
shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments 
pgl and merc are currently pursuing protests through litigation in texas and kansas  respectively

the fair value of contracts at december   includes million of liabilities held for sale  related to the sale of generation assets and the associated sales and service contracts in northern maine  which closed during the first quarter of the fair value of integrys energy services contracts at december   was impacted by the reduction in wholesale trading and marketing activity associated with its strategy change  as well as an overall decline in energy prices in includes the value of contracts in existence at december   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december  includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at december   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to december   which were included in integrys energy services portfolio at december  there were  in many cases  derivative positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these derivative positions are not reflected in the table above

integrys energy group s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities integrys energy group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives 
all derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets  unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
changes in fair value  except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  generally affect income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when integrys energy group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
in addition  integrys energy group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when integrys energy group holds assets  liabilities  or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge

integrys energy group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date  however  the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets 
beginning january   integrys energy services no longer includes transaction costs in fair value determinations 
as a component of fair value determinations  integrys energy group considers counterparty credit risk including its own credit risk and liquidity risk 
the liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available 
changes in the underlying assumptions for these components of fair value at december   would have had the following effects change in components effect on fair value of net risk management liabilities at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the consolidated statements of income  unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity 
asset impairment integrys energy group reviews certain assets for impairment as required by the property  plant  and equipment topic and intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment  as defined by the segment reporting topic of the fasb asc 
at integrys energy group  goodwill has been assigned to each of the five reporting units that comprise the natural gas utility segment and also to the integrys energy services segment 
the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit and reportable segment for the year ended december  was millions carrying value of goodwill wps pgl nsg merc mgu total natural gas utility segment integrys energy services balance at december  the goodwill for each of the reporting units is tested for impairment annually on april or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant 
the fair market value of each reporting unit is estimated using certain key assumptions that require significant judgment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections including the selection of appropriate returns on equity  long term growth rates  and capital expenditure levels  selecting appropriate discount rates  and identifying relevant market comparables 
the fair value of wps currently exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount  such that integrys energy group believes wps is unlikely to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in the foreseeable future 
however  in the first quarter of  the combination of the decline in equity markets as well as the increase in the expected weighted average cost of capital indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill might exist for pgl  nsg  merc  mgu  and integrys energy services  triggering an interim goodwill impairment analysis effective february  for these reporting units 
for this analysis  the estimated fair value for the pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu reporting units was determined by utilizing a combination of the income approach and the market approach methodologies 
more weight was given to the income approach as integrys energy group believes that the income approach more accurately captures the anticipated economics and related performance expectations for each of these reporting units 
in the first quarter of  integrys energy group announced a strategy change for integrys energy services 
because it was likely that integrys energy group would sell a significant portion of integrys energy services  the goodwill at integrys energy services was tested for impairment during each interim period in as well as at the time of the april  annual testing date 
at each testing date  the fair value of integrys energy services exceeded its carrying amount 
based on the interim test performed at december   the fair value of integrys energy services exceeded its carrying amount by more than 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations 
the key assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach included the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate  and the discount rate 
the discount rate represents the estimated cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a company s target capital structure 
the discount rates used in the income approach for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu ranged from to 
the discount rate used for integrys energy services was 
the terminal growth rates used in the income approach ranged from to 
the market approach for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu utilized the guideline company method  which calculates valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from publicly traded guideline companies in the regulated natural gas distribution industry 
multiples derived from the guideline companies provided an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company 
these multiples were then applied to the appropriate operating metric for pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu to determine indications of fair value 
aggregate fair values of all of integrys energy group s operating segments were compared to its market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements 
when assessing integrys energy group s market capitalization  the average stock price days before and after the interim february   valuation date was used 
the comparison between the aggregate fair values of all reporting units of integrys energy group and the market capitalization indicated an implied control premium 
a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within a range of the overall premiums observed in the market place 
as a result of applying the first step of goodwill impairment testing to determine if potential goodwill impairment existed at the february  interim testing date  integrys energy services passed fair value exceeded carrying amount and pgl  nsg  merc  and mgu failed carrying amount exceeded fair value 
as a result  a million pre tax impairment loss was recorded in the first quarter of  which included a million goodwill impairment loss related to pgl  a million goodwill impairment loss related to nsg  a million goodwill impairment loss related to merc  and an million goodwill impairment loss related to mgu 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for information 
on the april  annual goodwill impairment testing date  an increase in equity values for united states companies  as well as a decrease in the discount rate since february   resulted in the fair values of pgl  nsg  merc and mgu exceeding their respective carrying amounts 
the resulting fair values exceeded the carrying amount by less than for each of these four reporting units 
other integrys energy group evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the income statement 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale 
for integrys energy group s regulated utilities  an asset impairment requires further assessment to determine if a regulatory asset should be recorded 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to integrys energy services than to any other segment because of its lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to the regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of integrys energy services property  plant  and equipment totaled million 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary assumptions used at integrys energy services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams that depend on future commodity prices  capital expenditures  environmental landscape  and operating costs 
a combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
integrys energy services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources 
these assumptions are modeled over the projected remaining life of the asset 
throughout  integrys energy services tested various assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that a test was required 
no material impairment charges were recorded in as a result of the recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
future results or changes in assumptions could result in an impairment 
receivables and reserves the regulated natural gas and electric utilities and integrys energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class or contracted rates 
at december  and  integrys energy group s unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period 
differences historically have not been significant 
the majority of the bad debt expense at the utilities is recovered through rates 
integrys energy services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to bad debt expense and the uncollectible reserve balance 
at december  and  integrys energy services reserve for uncollectible accounts was million and million  respectively 
pension and other postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
integrys energy group s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only

the yield curve is comprised of non callable or callable with make whole provisions  high quality corporate bonds with maturities between and years 
the included bonds are generally rated aa with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
the expected annual benefit cash flows are discounted for each of integrys energy group s pension and retiree welfare plans using this yield curve  and a single point discount rate is developed matching each plan s expected payout structure 
integrys energy group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns  as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in   and for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
changes in fair value are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by wps  while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by ibs and pec 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered 
for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that integrys energy group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans 
regulatory accounting the electric and natural gas utility segments of integrys energy group follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc  and the financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by integrys energy group s regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if the regulated electric and natural gas utility segments or a separable portion of those segments would no longer meet the criteria for application 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet  but rather classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all of integrys energy group s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  for more information 
environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas operations integrys energy group s natural gas utilities  their predecessors  and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing and storing manufactured gas 
the utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs incurred in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas plant sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities 
the amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and management s best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites 
management s estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs 
management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs  and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters 
tax provision integrys energy group is required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of the process of preparing integrys energy group s consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheets 
integrys energy group must also assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
to the extent integrys energy group believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates 
integrys energy group adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas now incorporated as part of the income taxes topic of the fasb asc  which requires that only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized 
the change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on an evaluation of the nature of uncertainty  the nature of event that could cause the change  and an estimate of the range of reasonably possible changes 
as allowed under interpretation no 
 integrys energy group also elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of provision for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining integrys energy group s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and technical interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on integrys energy group s financial condition and results of operations 
see note o  summary of significant accounting policies income taxes  and note  income taxes  for a discussion of accounting for income taxes 
impact of inflation integrys energy group s financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
for integrys energy group s regulated operations  to the extent it is not recovering the effects of inflation  it will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
integrys energy group s nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks integrys energy group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  and equity return and principal preservation risk 
integrys energy group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate 
integrys energy group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk utilities the electric utilities of integrys energy group purchase natural gas  fuel oil  and coal for use in power generation 
they also buy power from the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco and by the wholesale electric operations and michigan retail electric operations of wps 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wps s wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations 
instead  a fuel window mechanism has partially mitigated the year to year price risk 
see note e  summary of significant accounting policies revenue and customer receivables  for more information 
to manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operations of wps and the natural gas operations of wps  pgl  nsg  and merc employ risk management techniques  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures  and options 
integrys energy services integrys energy services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy group employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio primarily natural gas and power positions  which also includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet 
the var calculation excludes the long dated positions created by owning merchant generation and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  and other ancillary fuels 
additionally  financial transmission rights  renewable energy credits  and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the var calculation 
the capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a var that would not be representative of the actual exposure 
therefore  integrys energy services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions which would represent the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations  stress testing  and scenario based testing 
in conjunction with the var analysis  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
additionally  integrys energy services also uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements 
var has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results 
most importantly  var does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio 
price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported var 
large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions 
also  the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions 
short term reductions in market liquidity could cause integrys energy services to hold positions open longer than anticipated  resulting in greater than predicted losses 
additionally  there are other risks not captured by the var metric including  but not limited to  the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which integrys energy services transacts 
customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses  realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts  or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of our counterparties are not met 
market liquidity risk refers to the risk that integrys energy services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions 
integrys energy services var is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level  as well as a ten day holding period and confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day or ten days  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as natural gas inventory  natural gas storage  and transportation contracts  to the extent such positions are significant  but excludes the positions mentioned above 
the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented below millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
the year over year decrease in var was driven by a substantial reduction in trading activity  as a result of integrys energy services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas and electric businesses  and its canadian energy marketing business 
interest rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
integrys energy group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
integrys energy group may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
due to decreases in short term borrowings in the last year  integrys energy group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates 
based on the variable rate debt of integrys energy group outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
equity return and principal preservation risk integrys energy group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and possible future required contributions for the pension plans 
integrys energy group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to integrys energy group s regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
effective may   and july   the defined pension plans were closed to new union hires at pgl and nsg  respectively 
effective april   and december   the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at uppco and wps  respectively 
effective january   the defined pension plans were closed to new local union hires at mgu
