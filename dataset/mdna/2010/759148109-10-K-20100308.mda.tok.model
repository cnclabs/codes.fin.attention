we entered the freestanding hospitals business on august  with the acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of meadowbrook healthcare  inc effective november   we acquired triumph healthcare holdings  inc  which added long term acute care hospitals to our portfolio of hospitals 
effective july   we acquired symphony health services  llc and its rehabworks business  which added contract therapy locations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in the first quarter of  we made certain changes to the structure of our internal organization 
these changes primarily consisted of making our skilled nursing rehabilitation services division responsible for oversight of our businesses that provide resident centered management consulting services and staffing services for therapists and nurses 
following these structural changes and the june sale of phase consulting  inc phase  we now operate in the following two business segments  which are managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services and hospitals 
program management services include hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs and skilled nursing rehabilitation services including contract therapy in skilled nursing facilities  resident centered management consulting services and staffing services for therapists and nurses 
our hospitals segment owns and operates long term acute care hospitals ltachs and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals

represents general corporate overhead costs associated with phase consulting  inc  which was sold on june  effective november   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of triumph healthcare holdings  inc triumph for a purchase price of approximately million 
on the acquisition date  triumph operated ltachs in seven states 
triumph s results of operations have been included in the company s financial statements prospectively beginning after the date of acquisition 
in  we also acquired ltachs in dallas  texas and philadelphia  pennsylvania and opened a majority owned ltach in peoria  illinois 
these activities expanded the number of ltachs we own and operate to  making us the third largest ltach provider in the united states 
effective june   the company completed the sale of all the outstanding common stock of phase consulting  inc phase to premier  inc for approximately million 
phase provides management and economic consulting services to the healthcare industry and had been a subsidiary of the company since it was acquired in this transaction allows the company s management to focus on its core businesses 
phase has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
prior year comparative amounts throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect the treatment of phase as a discontinued operation 
sources of revenue in our program management segment  we derive the majority of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors 
a portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities 
in our hospital segment  we derive nearly all of our revenues from fees for patient care services  which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or third party managed care programs 
our hospital segment accounted for of our consolidated operating revenues in we expect that percentage will increase to approximately in as a result of the acquisition of triumph 
the following table identifies the sources and relative mix of our hospital segment s net operating revenues for the periods stated year ended december  medicare medicaid other third party payors self pay total net patient revenue other revenue the decrease in the percent of net revenues attributable to medicare reflects an increase in managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in other third party payor category in the table above 
as part of the balanced budget act of  congress created a program of private  managed healthcare coverage for medicare beneficiaries 
this program has been referred to as medicare part c  medicare choice or medicare advantage 
while we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards traditional medicare  we expect this shift of traditional medicare patients into managed medicare and private fee for service plans will continue

cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved operating performances by our skilled nursing rehabilitation services and hospital rehabilitation services businesses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the increase in revenues combined with the cost savings achieved by eliminating approximately corporate and division support positions in the second half of these cost savings were more than offset by  an increase in both long term and short term management incentives  reflecting the improved overall performance of the company  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by our hospital segment including approximately million of external costs associated with the triumph acquisition 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses 
on a consolidated basis  the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million from million in to million in our hospital rehabilitation services hrs business decreased its provision by million in hrs recorded a million specific provision in related to the company s trade and note receivables due from signature healthcare foundation 
this specific provision was a result of signature s deteriorating financial condition during in february  the company terminated its staffing agreement with signature and took possession of signature s operating assets in full satisfaction of the company s receivables from signature

total skilled nursing rehabilitation services srs costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to an increase in therapist productivity and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses declined as a percentage of unit revenue primarily due to a reduction in labor and benefit costs as a percentage of revenue 
this was driven by therapist productivity improvements and lower contract labor usage in which more than offset the impact of wage rate and benefit cost increases 
improved therapist retention and a reduction in the time to fill permanent positions may have contributed to the decreased use of contract labor 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the cost savings achieved from the division and corporate realignment activities that were completed in the second half of depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower depreciation associated with capitalized software which became fully depreciated in as a result of these factors combined with higher revenues  srs s operating earnings increased by approximately million from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services hrs

we define the ramp up phase for an ltach as the period during which the hospital attempts to build its patient census following the receipt of its ltach medicare provider number 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from the prior year largely due to costs incurred for acquisition and joint venture development activities and an investment in back office resources to support the recent growth of the business 
in  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses for outside costs directly related to the acquisition of triumph and another million of expenses for outside services related to other acquisition related activities 
in  we incurred million of expense related to outside services for canceled acquisitions and joint venture development projects 
on january   we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations which requires us to expense all acquisition related costs 
prior to january   outside service costs incurred for consummated transactions were capitalized as a component of the acquisition cost and only costs related to canceled transactions were expensed 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from to primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with triumph and our other new facilities 
as a result of these factors  the hospital segment incurred operating losses of million in and million in non operating items interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the net increase in borrowings which occurred in connection with funding the november  acquisition of triumph 
the balances outstanding on all forms of indebtedness were million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest expense includes interest incurred on all our borrowings  amortization of deferred loan origination fees  amortization of original issue discounts  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in from million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively

both variances are discussed further below 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the costs of severance benefits incurred in  an increase in share based compensation and other management incentive costs and an investment in back office resources to support the current year and expected future growth of our hospital segment 
these cost increases were partially offset by the cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley  maryland at the end of june the hospital segment incurred a million impairment charge in as discussed in more detail below 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower amortization associated with capitalized software and intangible assets which became fully amortized in and the company s provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses

we generated cash from operations of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction of new hospitals  investments in information technology systems  equipment additions and replacements and various other capital improvements 
over the next few years  we plan to continue to invest in information technology systems and the development and renovation of hospitals 
the company has historically financed its operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments 
we believe our cash on hand  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion  and debt service requirements 
on november   we entered into a credit agreement as defined in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement provides for a five year revolving credit facility of million and a swingline subfacility of up to million 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants  the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately million 
the credit agreement also provided for a six year million term loan facility 
at december   the balance outstanding under the term loan was million 
the term loan facility requires quarterly installments of  with the balance payable upon the final maturity 
in addition  we are required to make mandatory principal prepayments equal to a portion of our consolidated excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement when our consolidated leverage ratio reaches certain levels 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in similar credit facilities 
in addition  we are required to maintain on a consolidated basis a maximum ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  a maximum ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda and a minimum ratio of adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and operating lease expense adjusted ebitdar as defined in the credit agreement to fixed charges 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
if we anticipate a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief from our lenders  however  such relief might not be granted or might be granted on terms less favorable than those in our existing credit agreement 
in november  we issued  shares of our common stock in a public equity offering which resulted in net proceeds  after underwriting fees and other direct costs  of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from the public equity offering along with the proceeds from our term loan facility to pay for the majority of the consideration used to acquire triumph 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts often provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt including capital lease obligations interest on long term debt unrecognized tax benefits other long term liabilities total we lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the amount of long term debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes unamortized original issue discounts of approximately  interest on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of december  this line also includes interest related to capital lease obligations  but excludes the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of deferred loan fees 
represents our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification topic  income taxes 
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  which involve various taxing authorities 
as a result  we are unable to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in investments designated by participants but remain our property until distribution 
because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include accounting for business combinations  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating contractual allowances  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired  intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by rehabcare include customer contracts  trade names and medicare provider numbers 
critical estimates in valuing these intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates  the asset s remaining economic life and future expected cash flows from customer contracts  trade names and medicare provider numbers 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our hospitals segment  the primary collection risks relate to the amounts for which the patient is responsible deductibles and co payments 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
our estimates of collectability require significant judgment 
if our customers ability to make payments to us were to deteriorate beyond the levels estimated  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
contractual allowances 
our hospitals recognize net patient revenue in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payors following their review of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances using the balance sheet approach on an individual hospital basis 
patient accounts receivable detail is analyzed to determine expected reimbursement for each patient 
expected reimbursement is summarized by payor classification and reconciled to the balance sheet 
a secondary review is completed at the consolidated hospitals level to validate calculations 
estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration medicare reimbursement rules and known changes to contract terms  laws and regulations and payment history 
if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
the estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined 
in  our hospitals recorded favorable net settlements of prior year medicare and medicaid cost reports aggregating million 
we did not record any significant adjustments for prior year cost reports in or we are not aware of any material claims  disputes  or unsettled matters with third party payors 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under gaap  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this impairment loss 
no other impairments of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives were identified during the three years ended december  as required by gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill  by comparing the reporting unit s fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
our primary reporting units are our skilled nursing rehabilitation services  hospital rehabilitation services and hospital businesses 
we calculated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
these assumptions are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  a divestiture of a significant component of our business  significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events 
in addition  as our business or the way we manage our business changes  our reporting units may also change 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our skilled nursing rehabilitation services  hospital rehabilitation services and hospitals businesses was million  million and million  respectively 
we have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended december  our most recent impairment test was as of december  a decrease in the calculated fair value of each of our reporting units as of december  would not have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on certain borrowings that bear interest at floating rates 
interest rate changes on variable rate debt impact our interest expense and cash flows  but do not impact the fair value of the underlying debt instruments 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate or the london interbank offering rate libor for one  two  three or six month interest periods  or a nine or twelve month period if available  plus an applicable margin percentage 
the base rate is the greater of the federal funds rate plus one half of  bank of america na s prime rate or one month libor plus 
the applicable margin percentage is based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
borrowings under our term loan facility bear interest at our option at either the base rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points with a libor floor of basis points 
adverse changes in short term interest rates could affect our overall borrowing rate when the contracts are renewed

at december   the term loan facility was subject to a one month libor contract and the one month libor rate was resulting in an all in interest rate of due to the libor floor and the basis point margin 
based on the million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in the one month libor rate would result in no additional interest expense as a result of the libor floor 
a basis point increase in the libor rate would result in additional interest expense of approximately million on an annualized basis 
at december   we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments
