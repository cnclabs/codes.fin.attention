item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item a  risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market bingo systems which includes server based wireless gaming systems  vlt s  slot machines and related software 
vlt s  slot machines and related software are collectively referred to as box business 
we entered the box business in march with our acquisition of summit gaming for million in cash 
for the weeks ended november   the weeks ended november   and the fiscal years ended october   our portable bingo terminals  fixed based bingo terminals  and box businesses made the following contributions to revenue weeks ended weeks ended twelve months ended revenue contribution november  november  october  portable bingo terminals fixed base bingo terminals box equipment as of november   we had bingo systems in service in states  various native american locations and the united kingdom  canada  and japan 
we had box sales in states and various native american locations 
we are marketing new server based wireless gaming systems where users play a range of games including bingo  video poker  keno and other slot machine games 
the gametech elite r server based gaming system was installed domestically in the third quarter of and in europe during the first quarter of fiscal the european configuration supports wireless bingo and fast action gaming for the european bingo market 
in addition to the gametech elite r server based system  we have also spun off a particular configuration of gametech elite r for the traditional bingo markets of the us as well as other international bingo markets 
this product is known as gametech edge tm  which was further developed in and was successfully installed in the summer of in a north american bingo hall 
gametech edge tm will be the premier us product offering in with further enhancements  features and bingo content planned for release 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue growth for our bingo systems is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo 
additionally  our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand operations into new markets and our ability to increase our market share in our current markets 
fixed based bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
for the weeks ending november  and weeks ended november   costs of thousand and thousand were capitalized  respectively  and amortization occurs over the expected term of the contract 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over either a three or five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our box business generates revenue from the sale of boxes new and used  software conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  parts  and services 
for the weeks ending november  and weeks ended november   and  respectively  of our box business sales were derived from the sale of new and used equipment  conversion kits  and parts 
in some instances  we recognize recurring participation revenue in lieu of a one time machine sale 
increasing market share in existing markets and expanding product placement into new markets drives revenue growth 
our bingo and box expenses consist primarily of cost of revenue  general and administrative expense  sales and marketing expense  and research and development expense 
cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems in bingo halls  depreciation and amortization of bingo terminals  cost of sales related to equipment sold  and repair refurbishment disposal costs of bingo terminals and related support equipment 
general and administrative costs consist of expenses associated with management of our company and the related support  including finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and amortization of intangible assets acquired from the summit acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products  and compensation paid to our internal sales force to manage existing customers  to generate new customers  and sell additional and upgraded equipment 
research and development costs consist of company sponsored activities to provide customers with new or enhanced games or game themes for our vlt and slot machines  improved bingo terminals  and to develop and test new wireless server based systems 
fiscal highlights during the weeks ended november   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the weeks ended november  as a result of various factors  including primarily the following million goodwill and million intangible impairment charge in million or decrease in revenue primarily due to a declining economy and increased regional competition  decreased total cost of revenue of million primarily due to a decrease in depreciation related primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated  and a decrease in cost of goods sold related directly to decreased revenue  million reversal of loss contingencies related to the trend trial  net interest expense decrease of million during the weeks ending november   our capital expenditures decreased approximately  or million to million  compared to million during fiscal  primarily related to the purchase of real property for our new headquarters in southeast reno  nevada in fiscal year fiscal year we report on a week fiscal year which began with the period ending on the first sunday in november for fiscal year ending november  includes weeks versus the fiscal year ending november  which had weeks 
the fiscal year ending october  was on a twelve month calendar basis 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued new standards for business combinations as codified in asc the objective of the new standard is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
it establishes principles and requirements for the acquirer to recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree  the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase 
it also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the new standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of asc will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
to permit entities  under certain circumstances  to continue to use the simplified method  in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with asc share based payment 
sab no 
amended sab no 
to permit the use of the simplified method beyond december  we continue to use the simplified method and will do so until more detailed relevant information about exercise behavior becomes readily available 
in may  the fasb issued new standards on subsequent events as codified in asc the new standard establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are available to be issued 
more specifically  the new standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition in the financial statements  identifies the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after june  we have adopted this standard during and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have evaluated subsequent events through january   the date this report on form k was filed with the us securities and exchange commission 
we made no significant changes to our consolidated financial statements as a result of our subsequent events evaluation 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  which establishes the codification as the source of authoritative accounting guidance to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the codification  which changes the referencing of financial standards  became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after september  the codification is now the single official source of authoritative us gaap other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force and related literature 
only one level of authoritative us gaap now exists 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification does not change us gaap 
we adopted the codification during our fiscal year ended november  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  obsolescence  impairment of goodwill  impairment of investments  loss contingencies  provision for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and our customer exists  delivery has occurred  bingo terminals are available or ready for play  or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we earn our revenue in a variety of ways 
we offer our products for lease or sale 
we also sell service and software updates for equipment previously sold or leased 
bingo equipment revenue is recognized for bingo terminals and bingo systems installed as a single element placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of customers to determine whether collectability is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine the factors are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
box equipment our product sales revenues are generated from the sale of vlt s  conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  equipment and services 
in some instances  we recognize recurring participation revenue in lieu of a one time machine sale 
revenues are recorded in accordance with fasb asc software revenue recognition and are reported net of discounts  sales taxes and other taxes of a similar nature 
revenues related to contracted production are recognized as the related work is delivered 
we recognize license fee revenues over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
amounts received prior to completing the earnings process are deferred until revenue recognition criteria are met 
although our current sales credit terms are predominately days  we will match the market in order to be competitive 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of amounts received or billed after a product is delivered or services are rendered  but prior to meeting all of the requirements for revenue recognition 
complex systems and or multiple element contracts may take several months to complete and our deferred revenues may increase as our products evolve toward a more systems centric environment 
deferred revenue totaled million at both november  and november   and primarily represents amounts received for future deliverables 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
we also provide reserves for slow moving components of our box equipment and bingo terminals by using factors such as historical data and future demand to determine the reserve 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated future demands  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals  results of operations  and financial condition 
software development capitalization we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products that meet the criteria of fasb asc costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed 
fasb asc provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we capitalize qualified costs of software developed for new products or for significant enhancements to existing products 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
we amortize the costs on a straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  typically three to five years  beginning when the product is available for general release 
the achievement of technological feasibility and the estimate of a products economic life require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts bingo equipment we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable arising from the lease of our bingo units 
our customer base consists primarily of entities operating in charitable  native american  and commercial bingo halls located throughout the united states  canada  united kingdom  and japan 
in some jurisdictions  the billing and collection function is performed as part of a distributor relationship  and in those instances  we maintain allowances for possible losses resulting from non payment by both the customer and distributor 
we perform ongoing evaluations of customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in the financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of estimates of collectability of our receivables 
box equipment we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivables arising from the sale of boxes and related equipment 
our customer base consists of distributors and casinos located in various states and native american locations 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb asc impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset undiscounted and without interest 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb asc intangibles goodwill and other  but at a minimum we do a formal valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets annually at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter 
we perform the impairment analysis of goodwill at a reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of summit gaming and added million to goodwill  which included trade names of million 
in addition  we acquired million in identifiable intangible assets which is amortized over to years 
we assessed the value of our goodwill as of july  our annual review date and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
we performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles as of july  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment and decreased revenues  we recorded noncash goodwill impairment associated with our acquisition of summit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles as of august  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment  decreased revenues  and delays in the release of new products to market  we recorded noncash goodwill impairment associated with our acquisition of summit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our analysis and discounted future cash flows  no impairment occurred on our bingo segment 
for fiscal year  we recorded million for the impairment of the obsolete gaming library related to the summit acquisition 
there was no impairment charge for long lived assets for fiscal and the annual evaluation of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we estimate share based compensation at the award grant date and recognize expense over the service period 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the fair value estimate 
judgment is required in estimating stock volatility  forfeiture rates  expected dividends  and expected terms that options remain outstanding 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of fasb asc legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of november   gametech had a high probability of prevailing in the trend proceeding 
as a result  the loss contingencies totaling million that had been recorded in fiscal   and were reversed 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in us federal  state  local  and foreign jurisdictions 
determination of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes depends on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes  reserves for uncertain tax positions  and income tax payment timing 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income in each jurisdiction  using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
net deferred tax assets totaled million at november  and million at november  valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
changes in tax laws  enacted tax rates  geographic mix  or estimated annual taxable income could change our valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which in turn impacts our tax provision 
we carefully monitor many factors  including the impact of current economic conditions  in our valuation of deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we did not record any additional valuation allowances  primarily due to the probability of realizing these assets over the next years 
at november   our total valuation allowance of million related to investment write downs not expected to be fully realized because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the specific character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
at the beginning of fiscal  we adopted new accounting guidance which required the recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
this assessment further presumes that tax authorities evaluate the technical merits of transactions individually with full knowledge of all facts and circumstances surrounding the issue 
changes in facts or information as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations and or settlements with tax jurisdictions may result in material adjustments to these estimates in the future 
we account for income taxes based on the estimated effective annual income tax rates 
the provision differs from income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different periods for financial statement purposes than for tax return purposes 
see notes and for additional information about our income taxes

net revenue bingo net revenue for the weeks ended november  decreased to million from million compared to the weeks ended november  the decrease is primarily due to hall closures and price adjustments from both adverse economic conditions and competition  which was partially offset by an increase in business from new products 
box net revenues decreased million for the weeks ended november   or to million from million compared to the weeks ended november  the decrease is primarily due to delays in releasing new products as we collaborate with regulators to obtain approvals on new software programs and other features in certain markets 
cost of revenue bingo cost of revenue for the weeks ended november  decreased to million  or of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  compared to the weeks ended november  this decrease is primarily due to million less bingo equipment depreciation over the comparable period in  mainly from certain travelers becoming fully depreciated in  a million decrease in service labor due to aligning expenses to business levels  a million decrease in the cost of disposals  slow moving and obsolete materials as a result of the write off of units and or parts on older product lines as customers migrate to the newer product lines  and a million decrease in amortization 
box business cost of revenue decreased to million  or of net revenue for the weeks ended november  from million  or of net revenue compared to the weeks ended november  the decrease in cost of revenue is in part related to the decline in net revenue  a higher mix of software sales in which have lower product costs  and a higher than normal write down of obsolete inventory in gross profit bingo gross profit decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the weeks ended november  bingo gross margin increased to of net revenue for the weeks ended november  from of net revenue for the weeks ended november  the percentage point increase in bingo gross margin is related to reduced labor and travel costs in service and operations plus other cost of revenue decreases as described above 
box gross profit decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the weeks ended november  box gross margin decreased percentage points to of net revenue for the weeks ended november   from of net revenue for the weeks ended november  the decrease in box gross margin is primarily due to a mix of lower margin sales in to louisiana  which is a distributor based jurisdiction  compounded by a high mix of software sales in which are higher margin 
operating expenses bingo general and administrative costs decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the weeks ended november  the decrease is primarily due to lower facility costs as we consolidate operations into our corporate headquarters  lower equipment testing costs due to higher capitalization  lower outside accounting fees  offset in part by increased legal fees related to the trend trial 
box general and administrative costs increased or million to million for the weeks ended november  compared to million for the weeks ended november  primarily due to increase in depreciation for the new corporate headquarters 
bingo sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the weeks ended november  this decrease is due to the decrease in distributor commissions directly related to the decline in bingo revenue 
box sales and marketing expenses increased to million from million for the weeks ended november   compared to the weeks ended november  primarily due to million in increased promotion costs as we invest and partner with our distributor to promote revenue growth in louisiana 
bingo research and development expenses remained flat at million for the weeks ended november   compared to the weeks ended november  box research and development expenses decreased million to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the weeks ended november  for the weeks ended november   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our acquisition of summit compared to a charge of million for the weeks ended november  see goodwill impairment section below 
for the weeks ended november   we recorded an impairment charge of million for an obsolete gaming library related to our acquisition of summit compared to no charge for the weeks ended november  interest expense interest expense of million for the weeks ended november  decreased million over the weeks ended november  the decrease is primarily due to a million charge in for a prepayment penalty and write off of debt acquisition costs associated with our previous credit facility  as well as a lower effective annual borrowing rate of for compared to for the interest rate swap expense was million for fiscal and for more information related to our swap agreement see note interest rate swap contract 
impairment of investments at november   we held auction rate securities ars with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  management determined that the estimated losses in these securities were other than temporary and recorded an aggregate pre tax impairment charge of approximately million for the weeks ended november  at november   the fair value of the ars were evaluated and the carrying value approximated the fair value 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held by us at november  experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
the eight ars in our investment portfolio having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million were classified as level iii as defined by gaap as no direct market inputs to make a pricing determination were available 
a discounted cash flow analysis was used to determine the estimated fair value of these securities 
based largely upon the credit risks of the issuers and the lack of an active trading market in these securities  risk adjusted discount rates were applied to determine the estimated fair value of our level iii ars 
seven of the eight ars in our investment portfolio continue to pay interest according to their stated terms 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received a tender offer for one of the eight ars and were able to sell them  providing thousand in cash 
accordingly  we reclassified the thousand net carrying value of this ars from long term to short term investments as of november  the balance remaining in the long term investments at november  was thousand 
goodwill impairment in fiscal  we acquired the assets of summit gaming and added million to goodwill  which included trade names of million 
in addition  we acquired million in identifiable intangible assets which will be amortized over to years

changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
the company also recorded a million intangible impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the impairment of an obsolete gaming library related to the summit acquisition 
loss contingencies as of november   gametech had a high probability of prevailing in the trend proceeding 
as a result  the loss contingencies totaling million that had been recorded in fiscal   and were reversed 
income taxes we recorded our income tax provision at an effective rate of for the weeks ended november   compared with for the weeks ended november  the actual effective tax rate is different from the expected federal rate of  reflecting certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting  and state and foreign tax provisions

box net revenues decreased  for the weeks ended november   or to million from million compared to the months ended october  the continued softness in the louisiana market affected vlt sales  as did delays in obtaining approvals on gaming products in montana 
financial results for the box segment may continue to be volatile from quarter to quarter until we have broadened our revenue base by expanding into more vlt markets  and by penetrating into the class iii slot machine markets  such as california and nevada 
cost of revenue bingo cost of revenue for the weeks ended november  decreased to million  or of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  compared to the months ended october  this decrease is primarily due to million less bingo equipment depreciation over the comparable period in  mainly from certain travelers becoming fully depreciated in  offset in part by a million increase in the cost of disposals  slow moving and obsolete materials as a result of the write off of units and or parts on older product lines as customers migrate to the newer product lines

operating expenses bingo general and administrative costs decreased to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the months ended october  the decrease is primarily due to lower outside legal fees as the activity on major lawsuits  such as the trend case  has declined since box general and administrative costs increased or million to million for the weeks ended november  from million for the months ended october  primarily due to a full fiscal year of expenses 
amortization of the identifiable intangible assets purchased in the summit gaming acquisition increased million due to the inclusion of weeks reported for compared to months reported for the fiscal year ended october  bingo sales and marketing expenses remained flat for the weeks ended november   compared to the months ended october  a decrease in distributor commissions directly related to the decline in revenue  and a decrease in advertising fees due to canadian legislative changes  was offset by an increase in employee costs related to additional positions 
box sales and marketing expenses remained flat for the weeks ended november   compared to the months ended october  bingo research and development expenses increased by million to million  for the weeks ended november   from million compared to the months ended october  the increase is primarily due to higher employee costs as a result of increased travel costs related to the gametech elite r testing in the uk 
box research and development expenses increased million to million for the weeks ended november   from million for the months ended october  the increase in the box segment is primarily due to a full fiscal year of expenses in  costs expended for developing new product lines  such as the california keno game which was approved in august  new hardware design and software development for a major vlt contract  and increased licensing fees as we expand our distributorship to new markets

with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held by us at november  experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
we determined the estimated fair value of these securities as of november  utilizing the standards set forth in fasb asc of the eight ars in our investment portfolio  three of them having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million consisted of level ii securities as defined by fasb asc 
for these securities  fair value was measured using the average sale price of recent observable transactions in the same securities 
the five remaining ars in our investment portfolio having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million were classified as level iii as defined by fasb asc as no direct market inputs to make a pricing determination were available 
a discounted cash flow analysis was used to determine the estimated fair value of these securities 
based largely upon the credit risks of the issuers and the lack of an active trading market in these securities  risk adjusted discount rates were applied to determine the estimated fair value of our level iii ars

changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
income taxes we recorded our income tax provision at an effective rate of for the weeks ended november   compared with for the twelve months ended october  the change in effective rate is primarily due to the goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of the weeks ended november  the actual effective tax rate is different from the expected federal rate of  reflecting certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting  and state and foreign tax provisions 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily through cash from operations and debt financing activities 
this capital is for operations  research and development  capital expenditures of equipment and associated support equipment  and software 
as of november   and november   we had a working capital balance of million and million  respectively

also included were payments on long term debt of approximately million  a million payment for debt acquisition costs  and the repurchase of our common stock for approximately million 
in march  we acquired substantially all of the assets of summit gaming for million in cash 
we financed the acquisition primarily with a credit facility consisting of a term loan of million and a revolving line of credit with a limit of million 
on august   we terminated this credit facility and prepaid all amounts outstanding as part of the requirements of our new credit facility 
we incurred a pre payment penalty of million on the pre payment of the term loan facility 
we also wrote off million of debt acquisition costs related to our prior credit facility 
our current credit facility provided a total of million of financing  million of which is in the form of a term loan and million of which is in the form of a revolving line of credit 
proceeds from the current credit facility were used to refinance our prior credit facility  acquire real property  and for general corporate purposes

we believe that cash flows from operations  cash  cash equivalents  and amounts available under our current credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations  provide for budgeted capital expenditures  and meet liquidity requirements through the remainder of fiscal our long term liquidity requirements depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  we may pursue strategic opportunities that could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital requirements or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that the additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 
in the event we were unable to raise additional capital if needed  further measures would be necessary  including the delay or reduction of our operations  research and development and other activities 
certain of these measures may require consent or approvals  including our lenders under the current credit facility  certain regulatory bodies  and others  and there are no assurances such consent or approvals could be obtained 
management does not believe that these limitations will adversely affect our operations or our ability to acquire necessary capital equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at november   we held auction rate securities ars with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held by us at november  have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
based on the fair value of the investments and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million during the weeks ended november  if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or we experience any additional rating downgrades on any of our ars  we may incur up to an additional million impairment charge related to our ars representing the aggregate fair value of our ars at november   which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received a tender offer for one of the eight ars and were able to sell them  providing million in cash 
on august   we terminated our previous credit facility 
concurrently  we entered into a senior secured credit facility the current credit facility with us bank us as lender  lead arranger and administrative agent  and bank of the west as lender collectively lenders that provides up to million of financing for our company  million of which is represented by a term loan note and million of which is a senior secured revolving credit facility 
us bank na will hold up to million of the current credit facility and bank of the west will hold up to million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company anticipated a collateral shortfall was probable  which would have triggered a mandatory prepayment of approximately million 
to avoid triggering a collateral shortfall and to reduce the outstanding balance under the term loan  the company voluntarily prepaid million from existing cash resources 
as a result of both the voluntary prepayment and scheduled mandatory quarterly principal payment  the outstanding balance under our term loan was reduced from million at august  to million at november  the term loan requires monthly interest payments which began on september   and quarterly principal payments of approximately million which began on october   until its maturity on august   when the balance will be due in full 
the interest rate for the term loan varies based upon the one month libor rate plus 
with respect to the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with us bank us  which exchanged the variable one month libor rate of the term loan for a fixed libor rate of per annum effective august   through the maturity of the term loan 
the average interest rate is 
because the interest rate on the term loan is fixed under a libor swap agreement  increases in interest rates will not affect our cash flow 
however  if we find it necessary to accelerate the amortization of the term loan  we could be required to pay early breakage fees on the libor contracts in the event that interest rates decrease 
assuming the million balance outstanding as of november   and the effective rate of interest rate of  our breakage fee on the full outstanding balance if libor declined by basis points would be approximately million  and an increase of basis points would result in a breakage fee of approximately million 
we do not anticipate the need to accelerate that amortization of the term loan at any time for the remainder of fiscal
