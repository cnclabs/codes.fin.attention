item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bassett furniture industries  incorporated together with its consolidated subsidiaries  bassett  we  our or the company  based in bassett  va  is a leading retailer  manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings 
our products are sold primarily through a network of licensee and company owned branded stores under the bassett home furnishings bhf or store or bassett furniture direct bfd or store name  with additional distribution through other multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers 
bassettbaby cribs and casegoods are sold through specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy 
our store program was created in as a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  well made furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
this service includes complimentary room planning  in home design visits  fast delivery  and custom order furniture 
this strategy both builds on our strengths brand name  balance sheet and product offerings and better positions us to capitalize on the changing furniture retail environment 
this store network included licensee owned stores and company owned and operated stores at the end of the following table summarizes the changes in store count during fiscal november  closures transfers november  licensee owned stores company owned stores total our wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in newton  north carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture 
we believe that we are an industry leader with our quick ship custom upholstery offerings 
we also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in martinsville  va 
most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants  primarily in china and vietnam 
we define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally 
for fiscal  approximately of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to for fiscal overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult over the past several years and have persisted throughout new housing starts are down significantly and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by difficult consumer credit markets and lagging consumer confidence 
all of these factors have significantly impacted big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
consequently  this has put pressure on certain of our dealers ability to generate adequate profits to fully pay us for the furniture we have sold to them 
as a result  we incurred significantly increased bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during the second half of as well as during although management will continue to work closely with our licensees to ensure the success of both the licensee and bassett  further store closures are likely during and could result in lease exit charges or increases in our lease guarantee reserve 
we also are likely to increase the number of company owned stores during  through acquisitions of certain licensee owned stores and  potentially  through targeted new store openings 
given the difficult and somewhat unprecedented environment  we have had no choice but to take several important actions aimed at improving our results and liquidity in the short term 
these include aggressively working with certain licensees to close those stores that are underperforming  thereby limiting further exposure in our accounts receivable 
reducing our inventory levels to improve working capital and cash flow 

table of contents right sizing our expense structure in both our wholesale and corporate retail divisions 
suspending our quarterly dividend 
delaying certain capital expenditures 
we will also continue to work diligently with our network of licensees to improve their operating results 
with the existing and planned improvements in our retail program and our strong balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned not only to survive these turbulent times  but also to gain market share as some of our competitors exit the industry 
as we continually monitor our business relationships with our licensees  we may determine from time to time that it is in our best interest to acquire a licensee s operations in order to mitigate certain risks associated with the poor performance or potential failure of a licensee 
such risks include loss of receivables or underlying collateral  potential impairment of the value of our investments in real estate used by a licensee or exposure to contingent liabilities under lease guarantees  and potential harm to our market share and brand integrity with a licensee s market 
in addition  we are sometimes approached by our licensees to acquire all or certain stores operated by the licensee 
we evaluate such opportunities considering  among other things  the viability of the market and our participation in the store real estate 
subsequent to november   we acquired the operations of seven retail stores from licensees 
funding for the acquisitions was primarily through the exchange of existing accounts receivable for net assets acquired 
although the final purchase price allocations are incomplete  we do not anticipate recognizing any goodwill as a result of these transactions 
with respect to two of the acquired stores which were previously operated by a single licensee  our decision to acquire ownership of the stores in early february came as the result of circumstances which developed during december and january which raised substantial doubt as to the licensee s ability to pay amounts owed to us 
accordingly  we anticipate recording additional bad debt charges of approximately  to  during the first quarter of fiscal associated with this licensee 
analysis of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal contained weeks 
net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and operating income loss were as follows for the years ended november   november  and november  net sales gross profit sg a bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges unusual charges  net loss from operations for comparability purposes  we have presented our selling  general and administrative expenses above without consideration of the effects of the bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges 

table of contents sales for fiscal were  as compared to  for and  for  representing decreases of and  respectively 
these shortfalls are primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions  which have impacted both retail sales and wholesale shipments in both and our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows wholesale retail inter company elimination consolidated net sales gross margins for   and were   and  respectively 
the margin increases result primarily from a greater mix of sales being through the retail segment as well as improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  decreased  in as compared to due to the reduction of administrative overhead and a general trend toward lower spending 
bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges increased due to store closings both completed and planned and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting our licensed retail network 
the operating loss reported by the company in  exclusive of the impairment charges  is primarily due to losses incurred by the company s retail segment and to the reserves recorded for bad debts related to sales to certain licensee stores within its wholesale segment 
these losses reflect both the deteriorating home furnishings retail environment and the shortfall between the amount of sales required to breakeven on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered 
the company continues to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new more value oriented product offerings  strengthening its design and sales talent  and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of its stores 
in addition  we are closing underperforming stores that we do not believe will be able to meet their required breakeven sales levels 
further  we have reduced the cost and expense structure of our wholesale segment to reflect this lower level of sales and the reduced number of stores in the total network 
we have begun to see the benefits of these efforts during the latter part of  generating income from operations of during the quarter ended november   as compared to a loss from operations of  for the quarter ended november  certain items affecting comparability between periods are noted below in investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net income loss

we have disbursed all of the severance benefits 
during fiscal  we also reduced our leased showroom space in the international home furnishings center ihfc by approximately and recorded a charge to write off the net book value of the corresponding capitalized tenant improvements 
as part of our expense reduction initiatives  we concluded during fiscal that four of our leased store locations would no longer be used by us as retail furniture locations 
we have finalized sublease agreements for two of the stores thereby reducing our future cash outlays 
although no sublessee has been identified for the other store leases  we are actively marketing these locations 
we recorded a  charge to recognize the future obligations associated with the leases  net of estimated sublease income

segment information we have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments as described below wholesale 
the wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design  manufacture  sourcing  sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of bassett stores licensee owned stores and company owned retail stores and independent furniture retailers 
our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  including those corporate expenses related to both company and licensee owned stores 
we eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments as well as the imbedded profit in the retail inventory for the consolidated presentation in our financial statements 
retail company owned stores 
our retail segment consists of company owned stores and includes the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities including real estate and capital expenditures directly related to these stores 
investments and real estate 
our investments and real estate segment consists of our investments in the bassett industries alternative asset fund lp alternative asset fund  marketable securities investments  equity investments in ihfc and zenith  and retail real estate related to licensee stores 
the alternative asset fund commenced on july   with private advisors  llc as the general partner the general partner 
we and the general partner were the only two partners 
the objective of the alternative asset fund was to achieve consistent positive returns  while attempting to reduce risk and volatility  by placing its capital with a variety of hedge funds and experienced portfolio managers 
the alternative asset fund included investments in various other private limited partnerships  which contain contractual commitments with elements of market risk 
in fiscal  we requested our general partner to attempt to liquidate all of our investments in the alternative asset fund 
during fiscal and  we received  and  respectively  for liquidations associated with various investments in the fund 
as of november   the fund held only a investment in the db zwirn special opportunities fund  lp  along with some remaining cash to be distributed in early due to the level of the remaining assets in the fund  the company and private advisors  llc dissolved the partnership effective december  and the fund s remaining investment interest in the db zwirn fund was transferred to the company

table of contents wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below wood upholstery other total fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales for the wholesale segment were  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of 
gross margins for the wholesale segment were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased margins on our upholstered furniture due to its custom nature  largely offset by lower realized margins on our wood furniture and certain discount programs designed to sell more furniture 
upholstered furniture also comprised of our total shipments in fiscal as compared to in fiscal wholesale sg a  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a decrease in wholesale spending due to lower sales and continued cost cutting measures 
we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges for fiscal  as compared to  during fiscal  as our licensees have struggled to pay for the furniture shipped to them in this prolonged and severe recessionary environment 
in addition  fiscal included an additional  in bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges related to periods prior to as a result of the change in accounting policies and processes pursuant to our restatement of form q for the quarter ended february  see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  net sales for the wholesale segment decreased to  the fiscal and fiscal reported sales increased by  and  respectively  as a result of a change in business practice with respect to freight charges on wholesale deliveries 
in july  we began invoicing customers on a fully landed basis such that the dealer invoice price includes the freight charge for delivery 
excluding this change  net sales decreased in fiscal approximately of wholesale shipments during fiscal were imported products compared to for fiscal gross margins for the wholesale segment were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal excluding the effects of the business change described above  gross margins for fiscal and fiscal would have been and  respectively  a percentage point increase over fiscal the increase in gross margins is primarily due to an improved product mix associated with increased imported products which carry a higher margin and the absence of the significant wind down costs incurred in fiscal related to the closing of the bassett plant 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or 
this increase is primarily due to the business change regarding freight charges described above 
excluding the effects of this change  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  primarily due to lower spending as we continued to adjust our cost structure to match the size of the operations 
bad debt expense increased significantly due to completed and planned store closings as certain of our licensee owned stores continued to be impacted by the deteriorating retail environment  strained credit markets  and lower consumer confidence 

table of contents retail segment company owned stores net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and operating income loss for our retail segment were as follows for the years ended november   november  and november  net sales gross profit sg a loss from operations fiscal as compared to fiscal our company owned store network had sales of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was comprised of a  increase from stores acquired during  offset by a  decrease from stores closed during and a  or  decrease from a decline in comparable store sales stores open all of both fiscal and 
gross margins for fiscal increased percentage points due to improved pricing and promotional strategies  partially offset by reduced margins from our inventory reduction sale during the third quarter of sg a increased  primarily due to corporate store acquisitions  partially offset by continued cost containment efforts 
as part of the store acquisitions during fiscal  we did not acquire the existing delivery backlog at the time of acquisition for certain of the stores 
consequently  we incurred significant sg a expenses rent and administrative payroll without a commensurate level of delivered sales 
on a comparable store basis  our operating loss was reduced by to  primarily due to lower sg a spending resulting from lower sales and our cost containment efforts 
we believe that the combination of new product introductions  store prototype retrofits  better hiring and training of design consultants and continued improved marketing efforts will lead to the further improvement in retail operating results 
fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal net sales for the retail segment increased to  these sales increases have primarily resulted from additional company owned stores and a increase in comparable store sales 
the comparable store sales increases were primarily driven by progress in our dallas market  the benefits of store consolidation in upstate new york  and increased sales in our pineville  nc store which we believe were driven by its conversion to the new store prototype 
gross margins for company owned stores in fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a result of improved pricing and promotional strategies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal the increase is a result of corporate store acquisitions 
the operating loss from company owned stores improved by  or in fiscal for the comparable corporate stores  we reduced our operating losses by approximately over fiscal our retail segment includes the expenses of retail real estate utilized by company owned retail stores 
rental income and expenses from our properties utilized by independent licensees and partnership licensees are included in our investment and real estate segment 

table of contents investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net income loss although our investment and real estate segment does not have operating earnings  income from the segment is included in income from investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
our equity investment in ihfc is not included in the identifiable assets of this segment since it is included in the long term liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
other income and expense items for fiscal  and are as follows loss from alternative asset fund income from marketable securities other than temporary impairment of investments income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net interest expense loan and lease guarantee expense other other income loss  net the alternative asset fund recorded a loss of  for fiscal as compared to a loss of  and a gain of  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the continued losses in primarily relate to the fund s investment in the db zwirn special opportunities fund 
the general partner has advised us that this decrease is due to the magnitude of the level of redemption requests  which are requiring the fund to totally liquidate all of its underlying holdings at less than favorable values 
we review our marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost basis of the security and include the loss in current earnings as opposed to recording an unrealized holding loss 
due to the decline in the financial markets during fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal  many of our holdings sustained significant losses 
consequently  we recorded  and  in other than temporary losses in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net includes income from our investment in ihfc as well as income loss from our other equity method investments  zenith freight lines  llc zenith and bdf northeast  llc bfdne 
on february   we entered into an agreement with bfdne whereby we contributed our interest in bfdne to bfdne in exchange for certain assets primarily inventory and leasehold improvements of bfdne s two stores in boston  massachusetts 
we recognized income loss from ihfc  zenith and bfdne as follows ihfc zenith bfdne loan and lease guarantee expense consists of adjustments to our reserves for the net amount of our estimated losses on loan and lease guarantees that we have entered into on behalf of our licensees 
we recognized expense of  and for fiscal and  respectively  to reflect the changes in our estimates of the additional risk that we may have to assume the underlying obligations with respect to our guarantees 
other for fiscal includes income of  associated with the receipt of death benefits from life insurance policies associated with our supplemental executive retirement income plan  partially offset by costs and expenses related to our real estate investments that support our licensees 

table of contents provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision benefit of   and  in fiscal  and the benefit recognized in fiscal resulted from our utilization of additional net operating loss carrybacks as provided by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of which extended the general carryback period for nols from two years to up to five 
fiscal includes a charge of  to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets as a result of the cumulative losses incurred in fiscal and fiscal includes a tax charge of  associated with the write off of deferred tax assets due to the termination of the lrg partnership 
our effective income tax rates are  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
excluding the charge to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our effective rate would have been in fiscal the effective rate for all three years was favorably impacted by exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc and unfavorably impacted in fiscal and by the write offs of goodwill 
see also note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective income tax rate for fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the current difficult industry conditions  to allow us to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute our long term retail strategies 
due to the continued housing slump and deterioration in the major financial markets and the overall recessionary economic environment  consumer spending has decreased  resulting in significant financial losses for us and damaging the ability of certain of our licensees to generate sufficient cash flow in their businesses 
during fiscal  we have implemented measures to reduce operating expenses and improve working capital to enhance our cash flow 
the following table summarizes the company s quarterly cash flows from operations for fiscal operating cash flow th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and respectively 
the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal over fiscal is a result of our operating expense reduction efforts and improvement in working capital  including successful inventory reduction efforts partially offset by the continued difficult economic environment resulting in lower collections on accounts receivable 
we increased our overall cash position for fiscal by  primarily through  of investment redemptions net of purchases of   in dividends from our investment in ihfc  and  of positive operating cash flow  partially offset by dividend payments of  and net payments on the revolving 
table of contents credit facility of  in addition to the  of cash on hand  we have investments of  consisting of  in marketable securities and  in the alternative asset fund 
it is also likely that our level of dividends received for will be less than in prior years as ihfc plans to conserve cash in anticipation of completing a debt refinancing by october  we do not believe that this will be materially detrimental to our overall liquidity 
with the current level of cash on hand coupled with the investment holdings and availability on the revolver  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
receivables and inventory cash collections on our accounts and notes receivable have a significant impact on our overall liquidity 
our cash flow from operations during fiscal was adversely affected by a  increase in accounts receivable before reserves due to the continued difficult environment at retail resulting in lower cash collections 
these slow cash collections have resulted in increasing accounts and notes receivable  deteriorating accounts receivable aging with increases in our relative past due amounts  and a corresponding increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our percentage of accounts receivable that are over days past due has increased from approximately at november  to approximately at november  with the majority of that increase occurring in the first two quarters 
as such  we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges for fiscal as compared to  during fiscal we also recorded  and  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  which are significantly lower than any of the preceding four quarters 
this significant decrease in charges is primarily due to the company working diligently with the licensees to better manage accounts and notes receivable exposure 
in response to slow collections  certain of our licensees have been placed on a temporary cash before delivery program for current orders that is designed to prevent any additional increase in the accounts receivable exposure 
we expect the rate of cash collections to increase when the recessionary environment begins to subside such that our total receivables will begin to decrease 
the following table reflects our accounts receivable and notes receivable and related bad debt reserves november  november  gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable gross notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable net notes receivable our accounts and notes receivable reserve and notes discount activity for fiscal are as follows accounts receivable notes receivable total balance at november  bad debt and note valuation charges write offs discount amortization balance at november  our licensee review committee lrc consists of our ceo  vp chief accounting officer  senior vp of retail  vp of licensed retail  and corporate director of credit 
the lrc meets frequently to review licensee 
table of contents performance  typically reviewing a wide range of licensee related issues  including licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee and its sales 
should a licensee have substantial past due amounts due to us  but is otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  the committee has  in the past  decided to move all or a portion of the licensee s past due accounts receivable to a note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
due to continued liquidity issues with our licensees  we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
as part of the improvement plans with one of our licensees  we converted  of past due trade accounts receivable and refinanced an existing note with a remaining balance of into a  long term note bearing interest at during the quarter ended february  this note requires interest only payments through and interest and principal payments due monthly through its maturity on december  during the quarter ended may   we converted and of past due trade accounts receivable for two licensees to long term interest bearing notes 
the note requires interest only payments through march   and principal and interest payments due monthly through its maturity date of march  the note requires interest only payments through march   with the remaining interest and principal due on april  the initial carrying value of the notes is determined using present value techniques which consider the fair market rate of interest based on the licensee s risk profile and estimated cash flows to be received 
we considered the stated interest rates to be below market due to the overall lack of availability of credit in the financial markets 
the following table presents summary fair value information at the inception of these notes face value discount rate fair value our accounts and notes receivable are secured by the filing of security statements in accordance with the uniform commercial code and or real estate owned by the note holder and in some cases  personal guarantees by our licensees 
historically  we have not foreclosed on the property to satisfy the respective receivable 
our practice has generally been to work with the store owner to run a going out of business sale and use any proceeds to fund the remaining receivable 
our success with these events has varied 
however  typically the amounts recovered have not been materially different from the carrying amount of the receivable 
consequently  we generally have not been required to record significant bad debt expenses upon the conclusion of the event 
our investment in inventory affects our liquidity in several different ways 
first  cash paid for raw materials  labor  and factory overhead for the manufacture or assembly of our domestic inventories is typically paid out well in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories 
payments for our imported inventories are funded much further in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories as compared to our domestically manufactured or assembled inventories 
the length of our import supply chain necessitates complex forecasting of future demand levels and is highly judgmental 
in economic downturns  the speed at which we can respond to decreasing demand is slowed  as we may have imported inventory in shipment or being manufactured at any given time 
in addition  we may also have inventory commitments under purchase orders that have not begun the manufacturing process 
consequently  as inventories build temporarily during downturns or as we near new product roll outs  our liquidity is reduced as we have more cash invested in our products 
second  the availability under our revolving credit facility is impacted by changes in our inventory balances 
lastly  if we fail to respond to changes in consumer tastes quickly enough  inventories may build and decrease our liquidity 

table of contents our inventories consist of the following november  november  wholesale finished goods work in process raw materials and supplies retail merchandise total inventories on first in  first out method lifo adjustment reserve for excess and obsolete inventory we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand  market conditions and the respective valuations at lifo 
the need for these reserves is primarily driven by the normal product life cycle 
as products mature and sales volumes decline  we rationalize our product offerings to respond to consumer tastes and keep our product lines fresh 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in determining reserves  we calculate separate reserves on our wholesale and retail inventories 
our wholesale inventories tend to carry the majority of the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory due to the nature of our distribution model 
these wholesale reserves primarily represent design and or style obsolescence 
typically  product is not shipped to our retail warehouses until a consumer has ordered and paid a deposit for the product 
we do not typically hold retail inventory for stock purposes 
consequently  floor sample inventory and inventory for delivery to customers account for the majority of our inventory at retail 
retail reserves are based on accessory and clearance floor sample inventory in our stores and any inventory that is not associated with a specific customer order in our retail warehouses 
activity in the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory by segment is as follows wholesale segment balance  beginning of the year additions charged to expense write offs balance  end of the year retail segment balance  beginning of the year additions charged to expense write offs balance  end of the year our estimates and assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past 
we did not make any significant changes to our methodology for determining inventory reserves in and do not anticipate that our methodology is reasonably likely to change in the future 
a plus or minus change in our inventory reserves would not have been material to our financial statements for the periods presented 
in recent years and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal  we have returned significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases  the funding for which has been primarily from the orderly liquidation of our alternative asset fund investment and net liquidations of our marketable securities portfolio 
however  due to unprecedented turmoil in the financial markets  further erosion 
table of contents of home furnishings sales  and general uncertainty regarding the depths to which current economic conditions could worsen  the board of directors decided to suspend regular quarterly dividends commencing with the second quarter of cash dividends paid for the first quarter of were  and was paid for the repurchase of shares during during we received  for the liquidation of our investments in styx partners  lp and hbk fund 
lp due to the level of the remaining assets in the alternative assets fund  we dissolved our partnership with private advisors  llc effective december   and the fund s remaining investment interest in the db zwirn special opportunities fund  l 
p was transferred to us along with a cash distribution of we do not expect the liquidation of our interest in the db zwirn fund to be accomplished in the near term 
we currently have  outstanding on our revolving credit facility with  of availability after deducting amounts for outstanding letters of credit and guarantees under the licensee loan program 
the revolving credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain defined financial covenants including a minimum level of tangible net worth  as defined in the credit agreement 
on october   we amended the facility resulting in a decrease in the total facility from  to  an adjustment in the variable interest rate to libor plus with a minimum rate on november  and a reset of the tangible net worth requirement at a minimum of  for fiscal and  for fiscal at november   our tangible net worth was  borrowings under the facility  which matures on november   are secured by a pledge of certain marketable securities and substantially all of our receivables and inventories 
in addition  to the extent the value of the marketable securities falls below  our borrowing base  as defined  is decreased by of the difference between  and the actual value of those securities 
at november   the value of our marketable securities portfolio was  subsequent to november   two real estate mortgages totaling  at november   which were to have matured in december  were extended to december  in exchange for principal reduction payments totaling  additionally  we are currently negotiating the extension of a third mortgage scheduled to mature in march of which had a balance of  at november  we can offer no assurance that our negotiations will be successful  however we do not believe that the repayment of the mortgage by its currently scheduled maturity of march would be materially detrimental to our overall liquidity 
we lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our company owned retail stores as well as in the operation of licensee owned stores 
we had obligations of  at november  for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year 
we also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators 
lease guarantees range from one to ten years 
we were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of  at november  we have also guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for those stores 
the total contingent liabilities with respect to these loan guarantees were  at november  we currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately  and will be used primarily for remodeling of company owned stores and information systems to support e commerce initiatives 
we have plans to continue to invest in store remodels  conversions  and new store real estate over the next three to four years and at potentially greater levels based on the business environment and our net cash position 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change depending on many factors  including but not limited to the overall performance of the new prototype stores  our rate of growth  our operating results and any other adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to industry conditions  competition  acquisition opportunities or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing cash and investment portfolio and our borrowing capacity  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for 
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the ordinary course of business see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these obligations

off balance sheet arrangements we utilize stand by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business 
we lease land and buildings that are primarily used in the operation of bhf and bfd stores 
we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators as part of our retail strategy 
we also have guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for these stores 
see contractual obligations and commitments table above and note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k  for further discussion of operating leases  lease guarantees and loan guarantees  including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements 
contingencies we are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these legal and environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the facts presently known  it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best 
table of contents judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
we also consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our terms generally vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received 
during fiscal and  there were thirteen and five dealers  respectively  for which these criteria were not met and therefore revenue was being recognized on a cost recovery basis 
as of november  and november   seven and five dealers  respectively  remained on the cost recovery basis 
there were no dealers that failed to meet these criteria in fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our accounts receivable reserves were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross accounts receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified customer accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees and other customers on a quarterly basis based on factors such as their financial condition  our collateral position  potential future plans with licensees and other similar factors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivables and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and present economic conditions and trends 
in the current economic environment  our historical experience with customers carries less weight than in previous years 
the timeliness of a licensee s or customer s ability to pay us can deteriorate at a much faster pace than in previous years 
as such  despite our best efforts  the ultimate precision with respect to our allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be less when compared to previous periods 
although actual losses have not differed materially from our previous estimates  future losses could differ from our current estimates 
unforeseen events such as a licensee or customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
long term notes receivable previously  when in the ordinary course of business a licensee had substantial past due amounts due to the company  but was otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  we may have decided to move all or a portion of a licensee s past due accounts receivable to a long term interest bearing note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
due to continued liquidity issues with our licensees  we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
some of these notes are collateralized by real estate 
at the inception of the note receivable  we determine whether the note bears a market rate of interest 
in estimating a market rate of interest  we first consider factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee 
table of contents operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
for those licensees where there is a concern of collectability  our estimated market rate of interest is based on certain published high yield bond indices 
for those where collectability is less of a concern  the estimated market rate of interest is generally based on the prime rate 
a discount on the note is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate below the market rate and a premium is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate above the market rate 
we amortize the related note discount or premium over the contractual term of the note and cease amortizing the discount to interest income when the present value of expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the note 
interest income associated with the discount amortization is immaterial and is recorded in other loss  net  in our consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis we examine these notes for evidence of impairment  considering factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
after considering these factors  should we believe that all or a portion of the note receivable cannot or will not be paid  we record an impairment charge on the note using discounted cash flow methods to determine the impairment charge 
an impairment charge does not necessarily indicate that a loan has no recovery or salvage value  but rather that  based on management s judgment and the consideration of specific licensee factors  it is more prudent than not to record an impairment charge 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross notes receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets we evaluate our deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
a valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
investments investments are marked to market and recorded at their fair value 
we account for the alternative asset fund by marking it to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the general partner  adjusted for estimated liquidity discounts 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from income and are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from securities classified as available for sale are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method for ascertaining the cost of securities sold 
we also review our available for sale securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost of the security and include the loss in current earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  we consider such factors as the significance of the decline as compared to the cost basis  the current state of the financial markets and the economy  the length of time for which there has been an unrealized loss and the relevant information regarding the operations of the investee 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
the acquisition of assets and liabilities and any resulting goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit  wholesale  retail or real estate investments 
we review goodwill at the reporting unit level annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which established the fasb standards accounting codification asc or codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities  and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and  subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
the guidance is not intended to change or alter existing gaap 
the guidance became effective for bassett in the fourth quarter of the guidance did not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
all references to previous numbering of fasb statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts have been removed from the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of vies  which will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal this new guidance requires entities to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the enterprise is required to assess  on an ongoing basis  whether it is a primary beneficiary or has an implicit responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed 
this guidance changes the previous quantitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary to a qualitative approach based on which entity a has the power to direct activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact economic performance and b has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to the variable purpose entity 
in addition  it requires enhanced disclosures that will provide investors with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that adoption may have on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  referred to as subsequent events 
thus users of financial statements are put on notice of the date after which subsequent events are not reported 
this guidance is effective with all interim or annual financial statements for periods ending after june  the adoption did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
we evaluated all events or transactions that occurred from november  through february   the date these financial statements were issued 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this standard provides new guidance on the recognition and presentation of an other than temporary impairment for debt securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity and provides certain new disclosure requirements for both debt and equity securities 
this standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the company has adopted these provisions and there was no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance that requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
these provisions were effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted 
we began providing the related disclosures starting with our interim financial statements as of august  in december the fasb issued asc  business combinations identifiable assets  liabilities and any non controlling interest asc 
asc amends and clarifies asc which requires that the acquisition method of accounting  instead of the purchase method  be applied to all business combinations and that an acquirer is identified in the process 
the guidance requires that fair market value be used to recognize assets and assumed liabilities instead of the cost allocation method where the costs of an acquisition are allocated to individual assets based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill would be calculated as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired  however  negative goodwill will be recognized immediately as a gain instead of being allocated to individual assets acquired 
costs of the acquisition will be recognized separately from the business combination 
the end result is that the statement improves the comparability  relevance and completeness of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
the guidance will be effective for us beginning in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact asc will have on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  asu and asu no 
 certain arrangements that include software elements  asu 
asu requires entities to allocate revenues in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables using a selling price hierarchy associated with the relative selling price method 
asu removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu and asu should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu or asu will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 transfers and servicing topic accounting for the transfers of financial assets which amends the asc to include sfas no  accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
revised sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
requiring additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and any continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
it also eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and enhances disclosure requirements 
asu no 
is effective prospectively  for annual periods beginning after november   and interim and annual periods thereafter 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 equity topic accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash which clarifies that the stock portion of a distribution to 
table of contents shareholders that allow them to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively and is not a stock dividend 
this update is effective for our first quarter of fiscal the adoption of asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 consolidation topic accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification 
asu clarifies topic implementation issues relating to a decrease in ownership of a subsidiary that is a business or non profit activity 
this amendment affects entities that have previously adopted topic formally sfas 
this update is effective for our first quarter of fiscal the adoption of asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor 
the interest cost of the credit facility is affected by changes in short term interest rates and increases in those rates can adversely affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in market prices of our marketable securities 
at november   we had  in marketable securities which consisted of a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities  including money market funds 
although there are no maturity dates for our equity investments  maturity dates on other investments in the portfolio range from one to twenty years 
as part of our current debt facility  we have pledged certain of our marketable securities as collateral 
to the extent the value of the marketable securities falls below  our borrowing base  as defined  is decreased by of the difference between  and the actual value of those securities 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies 
substantially all of our imports purchased outside of north america are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in us dollars will not be material to our results from operations in fiscal we are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes  principally wood  woven fabric  and foam products 
a recovery in home construction could result in increases in wood and fabric costs from current levels  and the cost of foam products  which are petroleum based  are sensitive to changes in the price of oil 
we have potential exposure to market risk related to the current weakness in the commercial real estate market 
our retail real estate holdings of  for licensee operated stores as well as our holdings of  for company owned stores at november  could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties in the current market 
additionally  if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the  of lease obligations we have guaranteed on behalf of licensees as of november   we may not be able to secure sufficient sub lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees
