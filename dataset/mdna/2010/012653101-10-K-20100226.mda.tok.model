recent acquisitions and joint ventures over the last three years  we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures  including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses 
these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business  provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries 
the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years on october   we entered into an agreement with ibn hayyan plastic products company tayf  an affiliate of saudi basic industries corporation sabic  to form a joint venture called saudi organometallic chemicals company socc 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the two parent companies will build a world scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the arabian gulf industrial city of al jubail 
start up of this facility is anticipated by early on september   we announced the execution of a memorandum of understanding mou to form a strategic alliance with meadwestvaco specialty chemicals nyse mwv  a leading global supplier of activated carbon 
the alliance will secure a domestic supply of wood based activated carbon to complement our portfolio of total mercury removal solutions to the power industry and will launch mwv specialty chemicals as a commercial supplier to this emerging market 
on december   we reached agreement with weifang sinobrom import and export company  ltd 
to form a new fine chemicals joint venture that combined the existing business of sinobrom  a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in china  with our global bromine expertise across the world 
the new joint venture  sinobrom albemarle bromine chemicals shandong company ltd  is owned by us and creates new growth platforms for us in shandong province  the heart of the chinese bromine and derivatives market 
effective july   we acquired sorbent technologies corporation  a full service power plant mercury control provider  for approximately million 
this acquisition broadened our current bromine offerings and allowed us to bring innovative  low cost turnkey solutions to utilities and other bromine based mercury solutions providers in the industry while complementing our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative and viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace 
on july   we acquired controlling interests in our two antioxidant joint ventures in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited 
our ownership interests in these polymer solutions segment joint ventures increased from to 
the acquisition of the additional interests totaled approximately million payable in cash due primarily within one year 
on june   we acquired the remaining interests of each of these joint ventures for approximately million 
employees as of december   we had  employees of whom  or  are employed in the us   or  are employed in europe  and  or  are employed in asia 
approximately of our us employees are unionized 
we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations baton rouge  louisiana united steel workers usw  orangeburg  south carolina international brotherhood of teamsters industrial trades division  and pasadena  texas united steel workers usw  sheet metal workers international association  united association of journeymen apprentices of plumbing and pipefitting industry  and international brotherhood of electrical workers 
we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions  and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than years 
bargaining agreements expire at our baton rouge  louisiana and orangeburg  south carolina locations in and at our pasadena  texas site in we have two works councils representing the majority of our european sites amsterdam  the netherlands and bergheim  germany covering approximately employees 
in addition  we have approximately employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth  united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives 
in september  we entered into 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries consultation processes under local laws at our amsterdam and bergheim locations for restructuring programs that include planned reductions in force 
at december   we accrued approximately million in related charges for our amsterdam restructuring program 
at december   the exact cost of the bergheim restructuring program could not be determined  however  we estimate the cost associated with this program will be in the range of million to million 
stock split on february   our board of directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a share distribution 
we distributed approximately million shares of common stock on march   to shareholders of record as of february  the par value of the common stock remains per share 
all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this two for one stock split

risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
adverse conditions in the global economy and the volatility and disruption of financial markets could negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products  negatively impacting our operating results 
our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic conditions  including a stringent credit market  which can impact our liquidity as well as the liquidity of our customers and suppliers  declining consumer and business confidence  fluctuating commodity prices  volatile exchange rates  and other challenges that can affect the global economy 
our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses  cash flow shortages  and difficulty obtaining financing 
as a result  existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion 
further  suppliers may experience similar conditions  which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
if a global recession arises and continues for significant future periods or if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly 
increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals  including molybdenum  which is used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 
downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter 
in addition  the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
in addition  crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 
changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  our fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian sources 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more cost effective 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries catalysts products 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states 
we and our joint ventures currently have approximately facilities located outside the united states  including facilities and offices located in austria  australia  belgium  brazil  france  germany  hungary  india  italy  japan  jordan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  russia  saudi arabia  singapore  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  trade sanctions could result in losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome  unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  and our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate in high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures are reported in the relevant functional currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities because foreign assets and liabilities  as well as net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins  that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements could result in exchange losses 
the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency rate exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  korean won  chinese yuan and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of  or exposure to  such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 
we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 
growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we may become subject 
potentially  some form of us federal regulation is forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co and or cap and trade legislation 
additionally  some of our operations are within other jurisdictions that have  or are developing  regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions 
for example  we have operations in the european union  brazil  china  japan  jordan  saudi arabia  singapore and the united arab emirates  which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol  an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol is set to expire in and global attention is focused on the development of a successor global policy framework 
the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions 
while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies  compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us  including  among other things  increased production costs or additional taxes or reduced emission allowances 
we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations through our contractual terms  which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth 
furthermore  the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely effect our operations 
contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation 
if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
regulation  or the threat of regulation  of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have marketed methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january  with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 
recently  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities  legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants 
we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products  which are used in a variety of applications 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether  which was banned for some applications in the states of washington  maine  oregon and vermont 
in the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july   and in televisions and computers after july  the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january  in december  we  along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal  in cooperation with the epa  from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years 
however  bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several states and in the us house of representatives 
norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april  except for certain transportation applications 
on april  the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive  ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption 
as a consequence  the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july  in  approximately of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether 
none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries additionally  agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants  including decabromodiphenyl ether  hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a 
we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants 
in the united nations unece agency decided that hexabromocyclododecane meets the technical requirements to be considered a persistent organic pollutant  or pop 
additional evaluations will be conducted before any action is taken against the sale of hexabromocyclododecane 
our expectation is that  if no exemptions to the pop ruling are granted  the sale of hexabromocyclododecane could be banned in europe as soon as mid additional government regulations  including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants  would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
in addition  the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on a weighted average interest rate of and outstanding borrowings at december  of million  our annual interest expense would be approximately million 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or our inability to refinance our credit facilities at existing interest rate spreads or at other commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
conditions in the global credit markets have improved in recent months but remain tenuous relative to the credit environment months ago 
more stringent credit standards and heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of prospective regulatory changes regarding capitalization and other requirements of major financial institutions are factors that could impede our ability to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms and result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
since we extended the maturity of our march credit agreement in early  before the recent period of financial and credit market volatility manifested  we do not have any significant obligation maturing before availability under existing committed credit facilities is expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our march credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain certain restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in our march credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see financial condition and liquidity long term debt in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our march credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services  or s p  and moody s investors services  or moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march credit agreement 
in addition  the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
weather related matters could impact our results of operations 
in and again in the third quarter of  major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials  which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products 
if similar weather related matters occur in the future  it could negatively affect our results of operations at our sites in this region 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail 
additionally  severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers 
future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
our collective bargaining agreements expire in and in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the us  the netherlands  germany  belgium  and japan  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 
during  we made a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be at least and  therefore  the plans will not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of further  based on the million contribution made in december  no minimum contribution is expected to be required for however  we may choose to make additional voluntary pension contributions in contributions after could vary depending on factors such as asset returns  then current interest rates  and legislative changes 
the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world 
as an american chemistry council member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 
new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries item legal proceedings 
on july   we received a notice of violation  or nov  from the epa region regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg  south carolina 
the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant  ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements  iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant 
we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations  but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties 
any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines  penalties  capital expenditures  or some combination thereof 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact  which may result therefrom 
however  we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition  we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses  particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund  products liability and premises liability litigation

we are committed to global sustainability and are advancing responsible eco practices and solutions in our three business segments 
we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity  technical expertise  flexible  low cost global manufacturing base  and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 
our diverse product portfolio  broad geographic presence and customer focused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth 
we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative  yet commercially viable  clean energy products and services to the marketplace 
we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts  on going productivity improvements and strong balance sheet position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions while softening the negative impact of any temporary disruption in the economy 
highlights formation of aluminum alkyls joint venture with sabic 
on october   we entered into an agreement with ibn hayyan plastic products company tayf  an affiliate of saudi basic industries corporation sabic  to form a joint venture called saudi organometallic chemicals company socc 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the two parent companies will build a world scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the arabian gulf industrial city of al jubail 
start up for this facility is anticipated by early formation of strategic alliance with meadwestvaco 
we announced on september   a strategic alliance with meadwestvaco specialty chemicals nyse mwv  a leading global supplier of activated carbon 
the alliance will secure a domestic supply of wood based activated carbon to complement our portfolio of total mercury removal solutions to the power industry and will launch mwv specialty chemicals as a commercial supplier to this emerging market 
breakthrough in flame retardant materials technology 
on december   we announced the launching of our first fire safety solution under our new earthwise tm brand  greenarmor tm  which is due to be commercially available in late greenarmor tm is a unique  organic flame retardant suitable for use in a variety of plastic resins that will provide better performance across a wide range of applications  while improving the sustainability of the plastic resins used in many consumer products 
this product is one of many in our developing portfolio of other sustainable fire safety and chemical solutions for diverse industries to address societal and industry expectations for sustainable technology and increased levels of product performance 
introduction of new refinery catalysts products 
during  we introduced new products in our refinery catalysts business 
our ketjenfine product  designed to significantly improve the performance of vacuum gas oil  or vgo  hydrocracking pretreatment performance  is built on our patented stars tm technology and offers best in class hydroprocessing activity for vgo units where both high aromatics saturation and hydrodenitrogenation activity are required 
also  we launched our go ultra fluid catalytic cracking product  a powerful new catalyst specifically designed for application to gas oil feeds to increase naphtha yields while significantly reducing coke  a critical advantage for refiners 
process optimization and restructuring programs 
during  we launched a series of process optimization and restructuring programs designed to improve fundamental business processes and build more optimal operating and transactional processing structures across our global operating facilities 
as a result  our operating costs were approximately million lower than comparative costs 
late in we initiated discussions with our works councils that will give rise to a restructuring of our workforce in a number of our european locations and plants 
the implementation of these restructuring programs will extend past also  we have identified and are in the process of implementing a number of other cost savings initiatives in  some of which will extend into  which will further reduce our costs and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our processes 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries working capital and cash generation 
we maintained very strong controls over our working capital and focus on cash generation as we endured the difficult economic environment that affected much of as a result  we were able to reduce our working capital in by approximately million  generate cash from operations in the amount of million  a increase over  and reduce debt by million 
increased dividends 
we increased our dividend for the th consecutive year  ending the year at an annual dividend rate of per share 
also  on february   we increased our quarterly dividend by to per share  payable on april  outlook polymer solutions our restructuring initiatives and operational efficiency improvements coupled with stronger consumer electronics demand are expected to help drive improved profitability of our polymer solutions segment in in the longer term  we believe the increasing standard of living around the globe should drive higher demand for electrical and electronic equipment and new construction  and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations and global climate initiatives should increase the need for insulation materials 
we remain cautious  however  on potential volatility in some end markets 
we have a strong presence in china and expect to continue building on the foundation for expanding our business footprint in asia 
the newly added capacity of our antioxidants facility in shanghai will be on line in first quarter in addition  we produce phosphorous based flame retardants at our nanjing site to serve the asia pacific construction and electronic markets 
a significant result of our investments in research and development is the creation of the earthwise tm family of sustainable products 
the first earthwise tm product from our polymer solutions segment is a fire safety solution called greenarmor tm  which we expect to be commercially available by late the earthwise tm portfolio is expected to grow to include products from other business units and segments of albemarle 
catalysts we expect revenue growth in our catalysts segment to be driven by global demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as part of the clean air initiatives 
while we continue to monitor developments in the global economy  we expect growth in our catalysts segment in to come primarily from hpc refills that customers have delayed for some time  new product introductions  new markets that we penetrate and the continued global growth in our polyolefin catalysts business 
a key strategic focus in our catalysts segment is globalizing and leading in emerging markets 
we expect to leverage our existing positions in asia  brazil and middle east  and work with our joint ventures to capitalize on growth opportunities in those regions 
our joint venture in saudi arabia with sabic  expected to be operational in  positions us for the longer term to lead in another key developing market and the fast growing middle east polyolefins market 
while our current hpc capacity is expected to meet demand growth in this business in the coming years  we continue to believe we will need additional hpc capacity in the future to meet expected longer term increased global demand 
we must also successfully pass through metals costs and ensure optimal inventory levels 
our focus in fcc catalysts has been on improving margins and delivering high performing  superior quality products to meet the unique demands of refiners 
we are also focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced new value added refining solutions and technologies that will enable refiners to increase yields  a critical advantage for refiners 
our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 
additionally  our alternative fuel technologies business is positioned to serve the rapidly growing biofuels industry 
we expect to continue exploring new alternative fuel opportunities by partnering with leading technology developers like neste oil corporation on their second generation renewable diesel  as well as opportunities in canadian oil sands  gas to liquids gtl  and coal to liquids ctl markets 
these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil prices increase 
fine chemicals our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
in our performance chemicals sector  we expect stable growth in as we continue to expand the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives 
in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement  our two strategic areas of focus in our fine chemicals segment have been to maximize our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 
improved bromine asset utilization rates and operational efficiencies will aid in this segment s profit growth in we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 
as we supply bromine feed stocks to our polymer solutions segment  our profitability is generally impacted as market conditions change in that sector 
the negative impact from weak market conditions subsided as closed  and we expect continued slow but steady growth in our bromine derivatives 
also  our new fine chemistry services products 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries pipeline is strong and opportunities are expanding 
our technical expertise  manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries 
we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 
corporate and other we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and maximizing cash generation 
in addition  we will continue to focus on tax efficiency  however  incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates than was the case in we believe our global effective tax rate for should be in the range of to but will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned 
we also expect increased expense for from our u 
s pension and other postretirement plans of approximately million based on year end discount rates and a reduction in our assumed rate of return on plan assets 
we increased our quarterly dividend payout in the first quarter of to per share 
under our existing share repurchase program  we expect to periodically repurchase shares in on an opportunistic basis 
in addition  we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

corporate and other for  our corporate and other expenses were comparable to summary of critical accounting policies and estimates estimates  assumptions and reclassifications the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and iii the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
where the company incurs 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries pre production design and development costs under long term supply contracts  these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist 
conversely  these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with accounting guidance that requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to not be amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value 
we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows 
future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  borrowing costs and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and  therefore  are beyond our control 
we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 
definite lived intangible assets  such as purchased technology  patents  customer lists and trade names  are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment 
see note  goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated financial statements included in item beginning on page pension plans and other postretirement benefits under authoritative accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
as required  we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan s funded status as of the measurement date 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets for these investments 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to indices such as the moody s aa corporate bond index  the hewitt top quartile and the citigroup pension discount curve  as well as a yield curve derived from fixed income security yields 
the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing country specific aa graded or better corporate bonds without special features or options  which could affect the duration 
in some countries  the yield curve may be based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk 
payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve 
for each plan  the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 
at december   the weighted average discount rate decreased for the pension plans from to and for the other postretirement plans from to to reflect market conditions as of the december  measurement date 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
for the year  the weighted average expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was  consistent with effective january   the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets has been reduced to 
there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase changed to from for the pension plans 
the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase changed to from for the other postretirement plans at december  in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees remained unchanged 
for  the assumed trend rate for pre coverage is per year  decreasing to an ultimate rate of in the year the assumed trend rate for post coverage is per year  decreasing to an ultimate rate of in the year the effect of a increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 
a decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions  primarily in the us in thousands favorable unfavorable increase decrease increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost actuarial assumptions discount rate pension other postretirement benefits expected return on plan assets pension other postretirement benefits rate of increase decrease in per capita cost of covered health care benefits not applicable 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and requires additional disclosures regarding benefit plan assets including a the investment allocation decision process  b the fair value of each major category of plan assets and c the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
we have adopted this guidance and have provided the additional disclosures required upon adoption 
of the million total pension and postretirement assets at december   million  or  are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 
gains losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets 
see note  pension plans and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item beginning on page income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses  capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers 
a valuation allowance  reducing deferred tax assets  is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character 
although realization is not assured  we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 
we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
once the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before all us federal income tax issues for the tax years through were resolved as of december with respect to jurisdictions outside the us  we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before during  we completed the tax audit for the following tax jurisdiction and respective tax years germany  through and belgium  and for one of our belgian companies 
during  we completed the tax audits for the following tax jurisdictions and respective tax years belgium  through  united kingdom   and the netherlands  through no significant tax was assessed as a result of these audits 
we were informed in january that the belgian tax authorities would commence an audit of another of our belgian companies for the years and while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
since the timing of resolutions and or closure of tax audits are uncertain  it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months 
our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions  relating to a number of issues  up to approximately million as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and closure of tax statutes 
we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries 
our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits  or e p  principles 
in general  to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e p amounts  deferred taxes have not been provided  as they are essentially permanent in duration 
the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
stock based compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date  the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of these awards is determined after giving affect to estimated forfeitures 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
to the extent restricted stock awards  performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k filings 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we are required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item we have a dedicated sox team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
a steering committee  comprised of personnel from finance and shared services  is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the compliance activities  and direct the efforts of the sox team

historically  cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by funds from operations  debt financing and equity issuances 
we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory 
we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our march credit agreement  which is discussed below  to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash flow our cash balance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  for  our operations provided million of cash compared to million in this increase of million is primarily due to improved working capital performance  partially offset by a decrease in profitability 
cash flows from operating activities funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of million  net repayments of debt of million  and dividends to shareholders of million 
net current assets decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in net current assets was due primarily to a decrease in inventory  partially offset by an increase in cash and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  up million from million at year end for  cash flows provided from operating activities of million funded investing activities of million  which consisted principally of acquisitions and capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment 
remaining cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds from borrowings of million were used to purchase million of our common stock and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling million 
capital expenditures in of million were used for plant machinery and equipment improvements and were comparable to expenditures of million 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in mainly due to increased capacity  cost reduction  and continuity of operations 
while we continue to closely monitor our capital spending and cash generation in light of the recent economic downturn seen in  we are optimistic that as we enter into  we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives 
additionally  we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our march credit agreement 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 
long term debt we currently have outstanding million of senior notes due in  or the senior notes

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include  among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times  failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods  an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity  and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries

other obligations the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction  purchases of equipment  various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligation expected interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations rental take or pay throughput agreements letters of credit and guarantees capital projects facility divestiture obligation additional investment commitment payments total these amounts are based on a weighted average interest rate of for the march credit agreement  for the senior notes  and for our remaining long term debt obligations and capital lease for the weighted average rate for years and thereafter is for the march credit agreement  for the senior notes  and for our remaining long term debt obligations and capital lease 
these amounts primarily relate to contracts entered into with certain third party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes 
in order to secure materials  sometimes for long durations  these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions 
we have determined that the expected contributions to our domestic nonqualified and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans should approximate million 
we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount 
we have made million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december  the liability related to uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 
liquidity outlook we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our march credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures  pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets  which may require additional liquidity 
while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions  their continued viability is not certain and could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments or to not renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit 
in recent quarters  the capital markets have remained volatile as a result of adverse conditions that caused the consolidation  failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
if  as a result  capital availability remains less prevalent  we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so  which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions 
in addition  our cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 
at december   we had the ability to borrow in excess of million under our march credit agreement and other existing lines of credit  subject to various financial covenants under our march credit agreement 
with generally strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before  we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position despite the current capital markets situation 
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local  and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party  or prp  and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in cases in which we have been designated as a prp  our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were million  million and million in  and  respectively  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  down million from million at december  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis  although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 
see also item legal proceedings on page capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the future  capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  korean won  chinese yuan and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations 
in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign exchange contracts 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by these parties 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  a forward contract may be employed to reduce exposure  generally expiring within one year 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized currently in income  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of million at december  we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in select exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in an increase of million in the fair value of our hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of our hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities 
we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these borrowings bore average interest rates of and at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million as of december  we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
our current interest rate spreads  which were negotiated prior to the global recession  will likely not be obtainable in the event that we would need to refinance our credit facilities 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables  and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
in addition  certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market  we purchase natural gas contracts  when appropriate  for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 
our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with major financial institutions 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 
our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market 
the unrealized gains and or losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction 
at december  and  there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding 
additionally  any unrealized gains and or losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
in  we entered into treasury lock agreements  or t locks  with a notional value of million  to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately of our january public offering of senior notes 
the t locks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 
the value of the t locks resulted from the difference between the yield to maturity of the year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the senior notes issued and the fixed rate of approximately 
the cumulative loss effect of the t lock agreements was million and is being amortized over the life of the senior notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the senior notes 
at december   there were losses of approximately million million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss that remain to be expensed
