the fund also earns interest income at market rates on investments in short term marketable securities 
from time to time  the fund generates income from time to time in the form of commitment  origination and structuring fees in connection with the fund s investments 
the fund recognizes all such fees when earned 
expenses 
currently  the fund s primary operating expenses consist of professional fees  compensation expense  and general and administrative fees

table of contents operating activities 
the fund uses cash to make new investments and follow on investments in its existing portfolio companies 
the fund records these investments at cost on the applicable trade date 
realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
on an ongoing basis  the fund carries its investments in its financial statements at fair value  as determined by the fund s board of directors 
see significant accounting policies valuation below 
as of december   the fund had invested of its net assets in securities of portfolio companies that constituted qualifying investments under the act 
at that time  the fund had invested by value in shares of common stock  in membership interests in limited liability companies  in preferred stock and in various debt instruments 
also  as of december   the fund had invested the proceeds of borrowings on margin as discussed below under financing activities in short term  highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of us treasury bills  interest bearing bank accounts and certificates of deposit  that are  in the opinion of the fund  appropriate for the preservation of the principal amount of such instruments 
under certain circumstances  the fund makes follow on investments in some of its portfolio companies 
as of december   the fund had a total commitment of million to trulite  inc in the energy sector which was subsequently funded in january see portfolio companies trulite  inc below 
financing activities 
from time to time  the fund uses leverage to finance a portion of its investments 
the fund then repays such debt from the sale of portfolio securities 
under the act  the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue debt securities or preferred stock which are referred to as senior securities  subject to certain restrictions including an overall limitation on the amount of outstanding debt  or leverage  relative to equity of because of the nature and size of the fund s portfolio investments  it periodically borrows funds to make qualifying investments in order to maintain its qualification as a ric 
during and  the fund borrowed such funds by accessing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
the fund invests the proceeds of these margin loans in high quality securities such us treasury securities until they are repaid 
the fund refers to these high quality investments as restricted assets because they are not generally available for investment in portfolio companies under the terms of borrowing 
if  in the future  the fund cannot borrow funds to make such qualifying investments at the end of any future quarter  it may not qualify as a ric and would become subject to corporate level income tax on its net investment income and realized capital gains  if any 
in addition  the fund s distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary dividends to the extent paid from earnings and profits 
see federal income tax considerations 
distributions 
on march   the fund announced that it suspended its managed distribution policy and payment of quarterly distributions for an indefinite period  following the distribution of the first quarter dividend to be paid on march  as originally implemented  the policy provided for quarterly dividends at an annualized rate equal to of the fund s market value per share as at the end of the preceding calendar year 
the fund will continue to pay out net investment income and or realized capital gains  if any  on an annual basis as required under the act 
possible share repurchase 
as a closed end business development company  the fund s shares of common stock are not redeemable at the option of stockholders  and its shares currently trade at a discount to their net asset value 
the fund s board of directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of its stockholders to reduce or eliminate this market value discount 
accordingly  the fund has been authorized to  and may from time to time  repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock including by means of tender offers or privately negotiated transactions in an effort to reduce or eliminate this market discount or to increase the net asset value of the fund s shares 
the fund is not required to undertake any such share repurchases  nor does the fund anticipate taking such action in significant accounting policies valuation of investments the valuation of portfolio companies is the most significant area of judgment impacting the fund s financial statements 
the fund carries portfolio investments on its financial statements at fair value  with any net change 
table of contents in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
the fund performs valuations of portfolio securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  and the financial reporting policies of the sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities 
the fund values investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded at their quoted market prices at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities  which the fund refers to as the valuation discount  if applicable 
as of december   the fund had no investments in publicly traded securities 
as of december   one of the fund s portfolio securities  metic group plc  was publicly listed on the aim 
the securities were subsequently de listed on june  the fund adjusts its net asset value for changes in the value of this security on a daily basis 
privately held portfolio securities 
the fund determines the fair value of investments for which no market exists on the basis of procedures established in good faith by its board of directors and based on input from the investment adviser and the fund s audit committee 
as a general principle  the fair value of an investment is the amount that the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective  and the estimated values arrived at by the fund s board of directors may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of specific portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor the fund uses to determine fair value until significant developments affecting a portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  the fund carries portfolio investments at appraised values as determined quarterly by management  subject to the approval of the fund s board of directors 
the fund typically bases its valuations upon a multiple of each portfolio company s income and or cash flow  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  this appraisal may be based upon estimated liquidation value 
the fund typically appraises its common equity investment in each portfolio company at a multiple of the free cash flow generated by such company in its most recent fiscal year  less adjustments for outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
in some cases  the fund considers projections of current year free cash flow in its appraisals  and it may also consider an adjustment to the estimate of free cash flow for non recurring items 
the fund applies multiples based on management s experience and recent transactions in the private company marketplace and cautions that these assessments are necessarily subjective in nature 
from time to time  the fund may elect to use third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis for its valuation of such company  although this is not the fund s typical approach to valuation 
this method of valuation is referred to as the private market method 
when an external event  such as a purchase transaction  public rights offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the fund applies the pricing indicated by such external event to corroborate its private equity valuation 
the fund generally uses the private market method only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
most of the fund s portfolio companies use leverage  which has the effect of magnifying its return or loss on investments 
for example  if management s estimate of a portfolio company results in a total enterprise value of million and has million in funded indebtedness  the fund values its equity at million 
if this estimate then increases or decreases by  to million or million  respectively  the value of the equity will increase or decrease by  to or million  as the case may be 
this disproportionate increase or decrease in equity value relative to total asset value adds a level of volatility to the fund s equity oriented portfolio securities 
from time to time  some of the fund s portfolio companies default in respect of covenants in their loan agreements 
when the fund has a reasonable belief that a portfolio company will be able to restructure its loan 
table of contents agreement to waive or eliminate such default or defaults  the fund continues to value its portfolio company s securities as a going concern 
if a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its debt or is not successful in refinancing its debt at maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on such portfolio company s assets or through reorganization or bankruptcy 
under such circumstances  the fund adjusts the value of its investment in the portfolio company accordingly 
the fund generally holds investments in debt securities to maturity 
accordingly  the fund determines the fair value of debt securities on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial condition of the issuer 
the fund values certificates of deposit at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
on a daily basis  the fund adjusts net asset value for changes in the value of publicly held securities  if any  and for material changes in the value of investments in securities issued by private companies 
the fund reports these amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly  and its daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes the fund intends to comply with the requirements of the code necessary for us to qualify as a ric 
so long as it complies with these requirements  the fund generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains distributed to stockholders 
therefore  the fund did not record a provision for federal income taxes in its financial statements 
as of december   the fund had a capital loss carry forward of million which may be used to offset future capital gains 
the fund may borrow money from time to time to maintain its status as a ric under the code 
see overview financing activities above 
interest income recognition the fund records interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis to the extent that it expects to collect such amounts 
the fund stops accruing interest on investments when it determines that interest is no longer collectible 
if the fund receives any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible  it treats such cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid  before it recognizes any additional interest income 
the fund accretes or amortizes discounts and premiums on securities purchased over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discount and or amortization of premium on debt securities 
payment in kind interest the fund has loans in its portfolio that may pay pik interest 
the fund adds pik interest  if any  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain its status as a ric  the fund must pay out to stockholders this non cash source of income in the form of dividends even if it has not yet collected any cash in respect of such investments 
recent accounting pronouncements on september   the fund adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to the authoritative hierarchy of gaap 
these changes establish the fasb accounting standards codification tm codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead the 
table of contents fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
accounting standards updates will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the codification 
these changes and the codification itself do not change gaap 
other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
on june   the fund adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value disclosures of financial instruments 
these changes require a publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods 
such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position  the related carrying amount of these financial instruments  and the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
on june   the fund adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting 
these changes provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this guidance is necessary to maintain the overall objective of fair value measurements  which is that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
on january   the fund adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis 
these changes define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance applies to other gaap that require or permit fair value measurements and is to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued changes to fair value accounting for liabilities 
these changes clarify existing guidance that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using either a valuation technique that uses a quoted price of either a similar liability or a quoted price of an identical or similar liability when traded as an asset  or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurements  such as an income approach eg  present value technique 
this guidance also states that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability and a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the fund adopted this standard beginning with its financial statements ending december  the adoption of this standard had no material effect on the financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an update to add new requirements for disclosures about significant transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level measurements 
in addition  the update clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fund does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
on june   the fund adopted changes issued by the fasb to accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  otherwise known as subsequent events 
specifically  these changes set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should 
table of contents recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
current market conditions during the year ended december   the state of the economy in the us remained in a recession and deteriorated throughout the year 
consumer confidence deteriorated and unemployment indices increased

stock market returns were stronger as the s p improved approximately during the year despite reaching a year low in the first quarter 
merger and acquisition activity was at its lowest level since in recent months  certain economic indicators have shown modest improvements 
to the extent that recessionary conditions continue or worsen  the financial results of middle market companies  like those in which we invest  will continue to experience deterioration  which ultimately could lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
many of the companies have experienced difficult operating environments and access to capital has been limited 
consistent with other companies in the financial services sector  the fund s performance has been adversely affected

we believe these actions continue to be necessary to protect capital and liquidity during this turbulent economic period in order to preserve and enhance shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources the fund generates cash primarily from maturities  sales of securities and borrowings  as well as capital gains realized upon the sale of portfolio investments 
the fund uses cash primarily to make additional investments  either in new companies or as follow on investments in the existing portfolio companies and to pay the dividends to its stockholders

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative information about market risk the fund is subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to investments in debt securities and outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
in the future  the fund may invest in companies outside the united states  including in europe and asia  which would give rise to exposure to foreign currency value fluctuations 
the fund does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
the fund s investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly affect interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
the fund determines their fair values based on the terms of the relevant debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
a major portion of the fund s investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments 
however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments 
a small portion of the investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities 
the fund is classified as a non diversified investment company under the investment company act  which means the fund is not limited in the proportion of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single user 
the value of one segment called shipping products and services include one portfolio company and was of the net asset value and of the fund s investments in portfolio company securities at fair value as of december  changes in business or industry trends or in the financial condition  results of operations  or the market s assessment of any single portfolio company will affect the net asset value and the market price of the fund s common stock to a greater extent than would be the case if the fund were a diversified company holding numerous investments
