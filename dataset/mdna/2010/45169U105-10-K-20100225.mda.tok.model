industry background the rise of global service providers has enabled companies to reduce costs and improve productivity 
this growth has been driven by numerous factors  including the broad adoption of global communications  increased competition from globalization  and the organization and availability of highly trained offshore workforces 
while many of the initial global providers focused on it services  numerous other players have arisen to offer business services as well  including bpo 
according to international data corporation idc  a global market intelligence firm  the worldwide services industry  which includes both it and business services  is projected to grow from billion in to over billion by it and business services are typically managed as separate offerings by service providers 
the two offerings have very different workflows and infrastructure requirements 
additionally  whereas it services require highly trained professionals  many offshore business services  such as bpo  generally require only graduates with foreign language skills 
as a result  many large service providers  who offer both it and business services  manage them through separate internal organizations 
many clients have also separated these functions 
unfortunately  this separation often results in competing interests between it and business operations 
as global services has become mainstream  many clients are now seeking tighter integration of their it and business processes to maintain differentiation and cost effectiveness 
additionally  as most bpo services depend upon client technology and infrastructure  many bpo clients are seeking to outsource their it services as well 
we believe that this demand will require global service providers to offer converged it and business solutions 
we believe that those providers who are experts in their clients it and businesses processes and who can best deliver converged services using a combination of onsite and offshore professionals will most benefit from these industry trends 
economic trends and outlook according to a forecast from idc in december  worldwide it spending will grow by in  returning the industry to spending levels of about trillion 
in broad terms  hardware  software and services spending will each grow in the range  with hardware experiencing the most notable gains after a particularly difficult according to gartner inc  an it research and advisory company  the it services industry with worldwide it spending forecast to total billion in  a increase from revenue of nearly billion 
with a global economic recovery widely anticipated  modest growth in it spending is expected 
the industry is aggressively pursuing innovations that it expects to stimulate demand beyond such modest growth 
a majority of our business comes from the united states and canada 
the situation has improved now with quarter on quarter revenue growth in the last three quarters of the current year 
we believe that our business model is somewhat diversified  both geographically and operationally we serve both it and it enabled solutions 
we believe our strategy of a global delivery model positions us well to provide a greater breadth of services in catering to market needs and opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following explains our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we consider revenue to be determinable when the services have been provided in accordance with the agreement 
when the terms of the agreement specify level parameters that must be met  we monitor such service level parameters and determine if there are any service credits or penalties that we need to account for 
revenue is recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client and net of value added taxes and includes reimbursements of out of pocket expenses  with the corresponding out of pocket expenses included in cost of revenue 
we recognize revenue on time and material contracts as the services are performed 
time and material contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
we also derive revenues from fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method where the price for an entire project is agreed upon for a predetermined fee before the project starts 
the pattern of performance on these contracts closely resembles the time spent by our employees and therefore efforts expended  measured based on the cost of the employee s time  is used as a measure for the proportion of services rendered in relation to the total services expected to be rendered  we also recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for contracts with no stated deliverables but with a designated workforce and bill customers based on a transaction fee basis 
revenue from these unit prices contracts are recognized on rendering of the services as per the terms of the contract 
the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work  including estimates and assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of work to be performed 
our project delivery personnel continually review the labor hours incurred and the estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for the contract 
changes in estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates through approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
investments in unconsolidated entities investments in equity shares of unconsolidated entities that are not quoted or publicly traded in which the company owns less than of the voting interest are accounted for at cost 
for investments in entities in which the company owns between and of the voting interest or otherwise acquires management influence are accounted for using the equity method and initially recognized at cost 
under the equity method  the company s share of the post acquisition profits and losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
in evaluating these factors above  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the fair value of the security is or more below the investment s carrying value for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criterion is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the company s carrying basis 
in  the company recorded an impairment of its remaining investment in concours  inc of million 
there were no impairments recorded in or allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by the company based upon historical and expected collection experience 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators arise 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon the company s market capitalization and the discounted future cash flow analysis 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment  if indicators of impairment arise such as termination of contracts with customers  restructuring actions or plans or downward revisions to forecasts 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
amortization of the company s definite lived intangible assets is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
income taxes in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax holiday periods in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we reverse the valuation allowance which would be reflected as an income tax benefit or as an adjustment to stockholders equity for tax assets related to stock options 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at entities or units that have been unprofitable and where we believe that such assets may not be utilized in the near term 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company purchases forward foreign exchange contracts option contracts derivatives to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies cad  gbp etc 
and recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asc topic 
all the derivative contracts are entered into by the indian subsidiary whose functional currency is indian rupee 
the company designates derivative contracts as cash flow hedges if they satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities asc topic 
changes in fair values of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income losses  net of taxes  until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in other income expense  net 
changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as effective hedging instruments and the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in other income expense  net 
such gains losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income in other income expense  net 
with respect to derivatives designated as hedges  the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
if it is determined that a derivative or a portion thereof is not highly effective as a hedge  or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  the company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting with respect to that derivative 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative is retained  the company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognizes any subsequent change in its fair value in the consolidated statement of income 
when it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the company discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes immediately in the consolidated statement of income 
stock based compensation effective january  we adopted revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment  sfas r asc topic 
the standard requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date based on the historical traded prices of our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property and equipment  carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles and goodwill  valuation allowance for receivables and deferred tax assets  valuation of derivative instruments  valuation of share based compensation  assets and obligations related to employee benefits  income tax uncertainties and other contingencies and commitments 
management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from these estimates

we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity igs s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation between the rupee and usd  cad 
this foreign currency risk exists based upon the nature of the igs s operations 
the majority of igs s customers and revenue are from united states and canada  which provides an inherent foreign currency risk between usd  cad and rupee exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing rupee rates mainly through financial market transactions 
these transactions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures

the fair value of foreign exchange contracts are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

in relation to currency contracts  this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the usd
