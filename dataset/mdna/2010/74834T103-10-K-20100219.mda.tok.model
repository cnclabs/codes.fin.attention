overview our company and business model quest software  inc  together with our subsidiaries scriptlogic and vizioncore  delivers innovative products that help it organizations get enhanced performance from their computing environment 
our product areas are application management  database management  windows management and virtualization management 
the focus of our products is based upon generating higher levels of performance  manageability and productivity throughout our customers it infrastructure and with products and services that enable them to manage the investments they have made within their it environment 
our initial core competency as a database management company was built upon deep expertise within the oracle database platform where we assembled a portfolio of products to manage and speed the development on 
table of contents the platform 
as customers required heterogeneous database management tools  we broadened our product portfolio to deliver complementary solutions and expanded our offerings to address other database platforms  including db and sql server 
today  most of our database management revenue is derived from products focused on the oracle platform 
in the last several years however  oracle has increased the functionality of their database products creating a stronger competitive offering which has impaired our license growth for certain products 
this has negatively impacted our database management license growth 
our database development product group led by toad continues to be the most significant revenue contributor of our oracle database products 
as we were impacted from oracle s encroachment within the management market we sought to diversify our portfolio and fostered development on microsoft s sql server database platform 
today  our sql server management products support backup and recovery  capacity management and performance management for one of microsoft s strategic platforms 
application deployments typically front large databases  thus the database logically interacts with other elements of the application infrastructure 
this logical linkage and reliance on the database led quest into its next product focal point known as application management 
beginning with our acquisition of foglight software in january and then sitraka in october  and continuing with our current offerings for application management  we have made significant investments and evolved the development of products for this market 
foglight remains our flagship product and largest revenue component of our application management offerings 
as our customers face the need to manage more complex applications with service oriented architectures  our products for identifying application outages and performance have become important tools 
improving and adding to our foglight offering has been a major focal point for us over the past few years 
in  we acquired packettrap networks to increase the functionality around our product capabilities in this area by incorporating network layer performance monitoring into our solution 
after establishing a market presence in both the database and application management markets  we sought to broaden our portfolio further into the windows management tools market in early with our acquisition of fastlane technologies 
in  we acquired aelita software 
our acquisition of aelita  combined with internally developed products  solidified our position as one of microsoft s leading isv s 
in august of we acquired scriptlogic  extending our product footprint to address desktop management  a new market for us 
further  in september we acquired netpro computing  inc netpro  expanding our active directory product portfolio 
in  and with the cloud computing paradigm gaining market acceptance  we launched our first set of software as a service saas windows management solutions  which is hosted on microsoft s azure platform 
we market and support management tools for six key microsoft platforms windows server  active directory  exchange  sql server  azure and the microsoft desktop 
our products address both migration and management of the windows platform 
our migration business comprises a set of products which support migration from other competitive platforms to the comparable microsoft platform  as well as migrations from earlier to the most current version of microsoft platforms 
in addition  we offer products which complement the core platform tools which are natively used by customers to manage these platforms once they are in a production environment 
as our windows products emerged and continued to grow in market popularity  the composition of our overall revenue profile changed from being primarily derived from oracle database platform tools to a more balanced profile with our windows products 
our windows products represent the largest portion of our total revenues 
as the market for virtualization began to develop we made an investment in vizioncore during which served as the cornerstone for our next strategic product line expansion 
during  we further expanded this product portfolio with subsequent acquisitions of invirtus and provision networks 
in december we acquired the remaining minority interest in vizioncore 
as customers increase the use of today s virtualization platforms the market is moving past the early adopter phase into mainstream production usage in support of server consolidation  disaster recovery and other usage scenarios across the datacenter 
the taxonomy of the virtualization management market is following the development of paths taken previously where platform companies create the delivery mechanism and partner with other third party vendors such as quest to support 
table of contents their platform 
today  the platform market leader is vmware  but with microsoft and citrix xensource entering the market  it is expected that cross platform tools will emerge to support the requirements of the datacenter such as provisioning  monitoring  reporting  disaster recovery and the typical functions found in today s physical environment 
we believe that the depth and breadth of our management capability across the entire it stack uniquely positions quest to manage this environment 
strategic acquisitions and investments have been a key part of our corporate strategy 
over the past three years  we spent approximately million on fifteen acquisitions and invested million in three early stage private companies 
this strategic deployment of capital covered many of our existing market segments including application management  windows management and virtualization management 
we intend to continue to identify and acquire companies in adjacent or contiguous markets  as we have done in the past 
we have also used acquisitions and investments to build upon or extend our core competencies with incremental technology to increase our existing product functionality or complete a key portion of a deliverable on the product roadmap 
we derive revenues from three primary sources software licenses  post contract technical support services maintenance and consulting and training services 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive maintenance for a defined period of time 
our license fees are typically calculated either on a per server basis or a per seat user basis 
maintenance contracts entitle a customer to telephone or internet support and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year maintenance contracts are typically sold with the related perpetual software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter at the customer s option 
generally  annual maintenance renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial customer purchase price which includes both the fee for a perpetual license and first year maintenance 
revenue is allocated to first year maintenance based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months  although at times we sell maintenance with terms of greater than months 
we also provide consulting and training services which relate to the installation and configuration of our products but do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
revenue allocated to consulting and training services is analyzed based on vsoe of fair value and recognized as the services are performed 
such revenues represented  and of total services revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
summary of consolidated financial results as discussed in more detail throughout our md a  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december   we delivered the following financial performance total revenues decreased by million  or  to million  total expenses decreased by million  or  to million  income from operations increased by million  or  to million  other income  net increased by million  from million in to million in  diluted earnings per share increased by  or  to  weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding decreased from million and million in to million and million in cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million 

table of contents our revenues were affected by a weak macro economic environment 
this was particularly visible within our emea sales regions where revenues were down approximately when compared to the period  while revenues in our americas and asia pacific sales regions were flat year over year 
in  we experienced a decline in revenues in all product areas except virtualization management  with the most notable decline coming from our database management product area 
our total revenues were also negatively impacted by the strengthening us dollar 
this resulted in lower us dollar equivalent sales for several currencies including the euro and british pound 
since certain of our international sales are denominated in these non us dollar currencies  the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately  or million  of the overall decrease in total revenues 
although total revenues declined  our management of discretionary and headcount related expenses  combined with the net benefit from foreign currency exchange rates  resulted in an increase in our operating margin 
a portion of the total expenses was due to a million litigation loss provision recorded in connection with our settlement of the shareholder class action relating to alleged stock option backdating 
see note commitments and contingencies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during  we experienced a significant decrease in personnel related costs  which include compensation  benefits and payroll related taxes compared to the same period in our full time employee headcount at the end of was  as compared to  at the end of our full time employee headcount in locations outside of the united states was  at the end of compared to  at the end of we continue to realize benefit from certain cost management initiatives we have undertaken since mid which include reduced headcount and travel costs  as well as other measures 
our total expenses were also impacted by the strengthening us dollar relative to certain non us dollar currencies in  which resulted in a lesser us dollar equivalent for several currencies as noted above 
since certain of our international expenses are denominated in these non us dollar currencies  our total expenses in were reduced by approximately million compared against the same period in as a result of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates when comparing rates to foreign currency while we are a us dollar functional company on a world wide basis  we transact business and operate using multiple foreign currencies 
as such  the value of our revenues  expenses  certain account balances and cash flows are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the value of the us dollar 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against several non us dollar currencies as has recently occurred  our foreign revenues and thus our total revenues can be negatively impacted 
a stronger us dollar translates into lower expenses in those entities where we have operations and our personnel and occupancy expenses are denominated in non us dollars  resulting in lower total expenses 
conversely  a weaker us dollar would have the opposite effects on total revenues and expenses 
in certain geographic regions and within specific currencies  partial offsets between revenues and expenses or balance sheet positions may reduce this exposure 
in other instances  we can manage our operations to reduce foreign currency exposure or utilize derivative instruments to manage this exposure 
see note derivative instruments for additional details

table of contents licenses revenues the decrease in license revenues was due primarily to decreased sales of our database management products across all geographic regions and windows management products in our europe  the middle east and africa emea region 
in we sold significantly more term based licenses  which resulted in million of deferred license revenue at the end of compared to million in  representing an approximate million increase in deferred license revenue that would have otherwise been recognized as license revenue in had those same sales been perpetual based 
our license revenues were also negatively impacted by the strengthening us dollar relative to certain non us dollar currencies in this resulted in a lesser us dollar equivalent for several currencies including the euro and british pound 
since certain of our international sales are denominated in these non us dollar currencies  the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately of the overall decrease in license revenues 
services revenues services revenues are derived from post contract technical support services maintenance and consulting and training services 
the largest component of our services revenues is maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenues are generated from support and maintenance services relating to current year sales of new software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
the main driver of our growth in services revenues was maintenance renewals on our windows management products in the americas 
also contributing to the growth in services revenues were maintenance renewals on our virtualization management products across all geographic regions 
maintenance revenues from our database management products decreased particularly in the emea region 
revenue from consulting and training services as a percentage of total service revenues was approximately and of total service revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues continue to contribute a larger percentage of our total revenues for two primary reasons growth of our installed base of customers via new license sales  and acquisitions and their related maintenance contracts 
as our maintenance customer base grows  maintenance renewals have a larger influence on the maintenance revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect 
therefore  the growth rate of total revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of changes in our maintenance revenue profile is the extent to which our customers renew their annual maintenance agreements  taking into account the number of products and licenses for which each customer renews  and the timing of the renewals by each such customer 
if our maintenance renewals were to decline materially  our maintenance revenues  total revenues and cash flows would likely decline materially as well 
over the past twelve months we have experienced declining growth in our maintenance revenues and expect this trend to continue through at least the three main reasons for this decline are reduced sales of new software licenses during  fewer acquisitions which resulted in less revenue contribution from acquired deferred maintenance revenues  and impact from foreign currency 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages decrease dollars percentage cost of revenues licenses services amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenues 
table of contents cost of licenses cost of licenses primarily consists of third party software royalties  product packaging  delivery  and personnel costs 
cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was and for the twelve months ended december  and the decrease in cost of licenses was due primarily to a million reduction in hardware and inventory purchases that are sold with certain of our software products and a million reduction in delivery costs

cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of purchased technology amortization of purchased technology includes amortization of the fair value of purchased technology associated with acquisitions 
we expect amortization of purchased technology within the cost of revenues arising from acquisitions completed prior to december  to be not less than million in the year ending december  operating expenses year over year changes in the principal components of our operating expenses are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase decrease dollars percentage operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of other purchased intangible assets in process research and development litigation loss provision  net total operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  and costs of trade shows  travel and entertainment and various discretionary marketing programs

the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately of the overall decrease in sales and marketing expense 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for software developers who develop new products  bug fixes and upgrades to existing products and at times provide engineering support for maintenance services  software product managers  quality assurance and technical documentation personnel  and payments made to outside software development consultants in 
table of contents connection with our ongoing efforts to enhance our core technologies and develop additional products 
the decrease in research and development expense during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was due primarily to a million decrease in personnel related costs and a million decrease in travel costs 
also  expenditures related to certain post acquisition contingent payment obligations that were tied to technology milestones decreased by approximately million 
research and development expenses were also impacted by the increased value of the us dollar as a significant portion of our developers are located outside of the us the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately of the overall decrease in research and development expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources  administrative and information services personnel  and professional fees for audit  tax and legal services 
the decrease in general and administrative expense during the twelve months ended december  over the comparable period in was due primarily to a decrease of million in personnel related costs and a million decrease in travel costs 
lower corporate insurance  recruiting and legal costs contributed million to the overall decrease in general and administrative costs 
the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately of the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses 
amortization of other purchased intangible assets amortization of other purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of customer lists  trademarks  non compete agreements and maintenance contracts associated with acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of other purchased intangible assets during the twelve months ended december  over the comparable period in was due primarily to a full twelve months of amortization of intangibles acquired during the last half of  resulting in an increase of million 
the increase from acquired intangibles was partially offset by certain other purchased intangible assets that were fully amortized prior to the twelve months ended december  we expect amortization of other purchased intangible assets within operating expenses arising from acquisitions completed prior to december  to be not less than million in the year ending december  in process research and development in process research and development expenses relate to in process technology acquired in may these costs were charged to operations as the technologies had not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses at the date of acquisition

income tax provision during the twelve months ended december   the provision for income taxes increased to million from million in the comparable period of  representing an increase of million 
the effective income tax rate increased to in  compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a combination of factors including the mix of income between high and low tax jurisdictions  a net benefit due to the closure of a california franchise tax audit during the year ended december   and the closure of an internal revenue service examination which provided a benefit during the year ended december  comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase dollars percentage revenues licenses americas rest of world total license revenues services americas rest of world total service revenues total revenues licenses revenues license revenues from sales of our windows and virtualization management products were the most significant drivers of license revenues growth during while database management license revenues decreased 
approximately half of the increase in our windows management license revenues came from the contributions of scriptlogic and netpro 
total license revenues in the twelve months ended december  benefited from the change in our revenue recognition practices for large reseller transactions 
the modified practice was applied to transactions consummated on or after january  due to change in 
table of contents circumstances involving improved cash collection histories with these resellers 
if this change had been implemented prior to january  we would have reported million in license revenues in  which would imply a growth rate in total license revenues in the period 
services revenues the main driver of services revenues growth in both the americas and the rest of world during the year ended december  was maintenance revenues from our windows management products 
approximately of the overall increase in services revenues during the period came from the contributions of scriptlogic  passgo and netpro

these securities are collateralized by higher education funded student loans which are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the ars were pledged as collateral for the amount drawn on our ubs line of credit 
in july  we drew down million  or  of the par value against the value of our ars 
we do not have reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our auction rate security investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments 
based on our current ability to access cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash that we expect to be available  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity of these investments to have a material impact on our business strategy  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  in october  we entered into a put agreement with the investment firm that sold us our ars 
under the terms of the agreement  we have the ability to put all of our ars to the investment firm at any time during the period beginning june  and ending june  at par value 
the investment firm also has the right to repurchase these ars at par value on or before june  for more information concerning our ars see note cash and cash equivalents and investments of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily comprised of net income  adjusted for non cash activities such as depreciation and amortization and compensation expense associated with share based payments 
these non cash adjustments represent charges reflected in net income  therefore  to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the analyses of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities are as follows accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  day s sales outstanding  or dso  were days and days as of december  and december   respectively  and our daily sales remained relatively flat at million for the quarter ended december  compared to million for the quarter ended december  collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our revenues and their linearity and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
deferred revenue increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting in an increase in operating liabilities and reflecting a cash inflow of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to growth in sales of time based software licenses  which accounts for approximately million of the overall increase in deferred revenue  and to growth of our software post contract technical support services customer base 
other accrued expenses decreased to million at december  from million at december   resulting in a decrease in operating liabilities and reflecting a cash outflow of million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in other accrued expenses was due primarily to payments of certain acquisition related liabilities 
one of the primary cash outflows within operating assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended december  was the net payment of million for our settlement of the shareholder class action relating to alleged stock option backdating 
see note commitments and contingencies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for details

we will continue to purchase property and equipment needed in the normal course of our business 
we also plan to use cash generated from operations and or proceeds from our investment securities to fund other strategic investment and acquisition opportunities that we continue to evaluate 
we plan to use excess cash generated from operations to invest in short and long term investments consistent with past investment practices 
we will also continue to use cash for capital improvements to our existing back office accounting and finance systems with a goal of automating more of our back office accounting and finance functions 
in we implemented a plan to improve our accounting and finance systems with an expectation that these improvements will support the back office functions for the foreseeable future 
we began making improvements in with a re implementation of our oracle accounting system 
the re implementation project is a multiple phase project with a projected go live date during the overall cost associated with this project is expected to be million to million  the majority of which will be capitalized and depreciated over approximately years 
we have also spent significant time  effort and money updating and implementing various other accounting and finance systems throughout and have additional projects planned for

any stock repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions  at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate  including pursuant to one or more rule b trading plans 
rule b permits quest to establish  while not in possession of material nonpublic information  prearranged plans to buy stock at a specific price in the future  regardless of any subsequent possession of material nonpublic information 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions  corporate and regulatory requirements  and capital availability 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
during the twelve months ended december   we repurchased  shares under this stock repurchase authorization at a weighted average price per share of  for a total cost of million 
on july   we drew down million  or  of the par value against the value of our ars 
as this credit line was structured as a net no cost loan  any interest charges will be offset by interest earned on the underlying ars 
see note cash and cash equivalents and investments for additional details regarding these investments 
on august   we entered into a loan agreement with mutual of omaha bank whereby we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million 
the loan is secured by our real property at our headquarters in aliso viejo  california 
we intend to use the proceeds from the loan for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the loan matures in five years  during which time we will make equal monthly principal and interest 
table of contents payments at a interest rate on a fixed rate  year amortization schedule 
events of default include  among other things  payment defaults  breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events 
in the case of a continuing event of default  the lender may  among other things  accelerate the payment of any unpaid principal and interest amounts  increase the then current interest rate by and foreclose on the real estate collateral 
as we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions  potential future stock repurchases or other general corporate expenditures which may be in excess of current cash available within certain operating entities  sourcing cash to fund these activities requires financial flexibility afforded by financing instruments 
as such  we plan to continue to evaluate potential debt financings when and if reasonable financing terms become available to us 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances  cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next to months 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption risk factors 
one of these risks is that our future business does not stay at a level that is similar to  or better than  our recent past 
in that event  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and debt financing to support our working capital and other cash requirements 
also  acquisitions are an important part of our business model 
as such  significant amounts of cash could and will likely be used in the future for additional acquisitions or strategic investments 
if additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements  acquisitions or other purposes  we may seek to raise funds through public or private equity or  as discussed above  debt financing or from other sources 
we can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that could reduce our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  and the effect we expect such obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations loans payable contingent consideration acquisition related obligations total contractual cash obligations our purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing contracts  public relations contracts and committed sales events 
we enter into earn out agreements with the shareholders of certain companies we acquire 
the earn out contingency are typically based on the acquired company s products total revenue or sales growth over a specified period after the acquisition date 

table of contents in addition to the cash commitments above  million of unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of penalties and interest  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled and is not included in the above table 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally perpetual software licenses and which portions must be deferred generally maintenance  consulting and training services 
in addition  we analyze various factors including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us make judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgments with respect to any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of fasb s guidance on software revenue recognition 
in accordance with fasb s guidance  we cannot recognize any revenue before all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we deliver the products  fees are fixed or determinable and license agreement terms are free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
we initially capture value for our products by selling a perpetual software license to end customers 
the fee for the first year of maintenance is included in  or bundled with  the perpetual software license at the time of initial sale 
as such  the combination at initial sale of a perpetual software license and one year of maintenance represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
when all four of our revenue recognition criteria are met  the multiple element aspect of our arrangements means the only revenue recognized upfront  at the time of initial sale  is the residual revenue allocated to the perpetual software license 
the revenue associated with the fair value of the undelivered maintenance and or consulting and training services included in the initial sale is deferred and is subsequently recorded to revenue ratably over the support term and as such services are performed  respectively 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on vsoe of fair value 

table of contents revenue for our standalone sales of annual maintenance renewals in years two  three and beyond is recognized ratably over the support term 
sales of maintenance for multiple annual periods are treated similarly 
revenue from our consulting and training services is generally recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the underlying service contracts 
our maintenance vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the prices our customers pay for this support when it is sold separately  that is  when we enter into an arms length  annual renewal transaction with customers where the only offering sold is maintenance 
these standalone maintenance renewal transactions are typically one year in duration and are priced as a targeted percentage of the initial  discounted purchase price which includes both the upfront license fee and the first year of maintenance 
we bill maintenance renewal transactions in advance of the services provided 
we also offer customers the right to purchase maintenance for multiple annual periods at discounted prices beyond the first year as they will be paying cash upfront  well in advance of the multi year services performed 
our consulting and training services vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to our established pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
our consulting and training services are typically sold as time and materials based contracts that range from five to fifteen days in duration 
we sell consulting and training services both standalone and as part of multiple element arrangements 
our vsoe of fair value is impacted by estimates and judgments that  if significantly different  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
these estimates and judgments include  among other items the ability to identify and validate vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements via the use of sampling techniques  the impact on sampling results of customer negotiating pressure on renewal rates  the impact on sampling results of maintenance renewals on deals originally sold via indirect channels  the fair value of that undelivered element for sampled transactions  and the economic impact of combining multiple renewal rate negotiations relative to varying products with varying purchase dates  into a single  new coterminous maintenance 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance  consulting and training services but we may modify our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
this could result in changes to our vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this were to occur  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements would differ significantly from our historical results 
if we were unable to support at all through vsoe the fair value of our maintenance  consulting or training services  the entire amount of revenue from our initial  upfront sale of both a perpetual software license bundled with one year of maintenance and any consulting and training services would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element hardware  software  specific upgrade rights  etc 
in a bundled software and services arrangement  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services are performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses each year wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive maintenance for a defined period of time 
approximately of license revenue was generated by these time based software licenses 
all license and support revenues on these term licenses are deferred and recognized ratably over the license term 

table of contents we license our products primarily through our direct sales force  our telesales force and  increasingly  indirect channels including value added resellers and distributors 
for our direct sales  we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions upon which our products and services are sold to our end customers 
for our indirect sales transactions  we accept orders from our resellers and distributors when they have existing orders from an end customer 
indirect sales through resellers are a growing proportion of our transaction volume 
these transactions are generally handled via processes and policies that are similar to an end customer sale 
we utilize written contracts coupled with purchase orders as the means to establish the terms and conditions of these indirect sales transactions 
we recognize revenue from reseller and distributor transactions upon invoicing the order provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for those resellers and distributors that have established a history of consistent  timely cash collection with us  we accept orders and simultaneously recognize revenue since the resellers and distributors have existing orders from an end user customer 
for those resellers that have not established a history of consistent  timely cash collection with us  we accept orders and defer revenue until cash collection occurs 
the probability of collection criteria per gaap is applied to each individual reseller or distributor rather than to all channel partners sales in aggregate 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
since such acceptance provisions are not contained in our software license arrangements as standard provisions and the incidence of returns in accordance with such acceptance provisions cannot be reasonably estimated  if a contract does include such a provision we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that cancellation is not likely  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other requirements have been met 
our standard payment terms require payment within days but may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
we generally deem payments that are due within months to be fixed and determinable based on collections history and thereby satisfy the required revenue recognition criteria 
for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for sales returns and cancellations as well as an allowance for bad debt 
regarding our allowance for sales returns and cancellations  our standard form license and maintenance and or service agreements do not typically or expressly provide for product returns or cancellations as a matter of right unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the 
table of contents breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established written specifications 
however  we maintain the sales returns and cancellations allowance to cover the circumstances where the company accepts returns or cancellations on a discretionary basis even though not contractually obligated to do so 
this allowance also covers estimated losses for our customer s unwillingness to make required payments 
the allowance for bad debt is for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments related to enforceable contracts 
to support both these allowances  we are required to make significant estimates of future software license returns  of cancellations for both maintenance and consulting and training services  and of write offs of customer accounts as bad debts all related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on these estimates  the contractual terms and conditions of our contracts  our accounts receivable aging and our historical collection experience with a customer base 
if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
while such return  cancellation and bad debt write off amounts have historically been within our planned expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that our sales returns and allowances will be adequate to cover future performance issues of our customer base and allowances may be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense and less revenue in the period such determination was made 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of and determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach and income approach were the methodologies deemed the most reliable and were the primary methods used for our impairment analysis 
we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews could result in significant charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
amortizing intangible assets these assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and include technology  in process research and development  customer lists  maintenance contracts  trade names  trademarks and non compete agreements acquired and are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we make estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  acquired company key personnel s willingness and ability to compete  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the net carrying amount of amortizing intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with fasb s standard on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 

table of contents investments in non consolidated companies all of our investments in non consolidated companies are currently accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have a readily determined market value and given that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist when we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements  are also typically considered in determining the appropriate accounting treatment 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies and  as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes but is not limited to a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes  and impacts from competitive pressures 
if we determine that the carrying value of our investment in a company is at an amount above fair value  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a significant amount of judgment  estimation and uncertainty and our estimate of income taxes can be highly sensitive to shifts of taxable income reported between such tax jurisdictions 
additionally  our us and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that could result from the examination of our tax returns 
determining the income tax expense for such contingencies requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
both steps presume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this may require us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  current year tax positions  expiration of statutes of limitations  litigation  legislative activity  or other changes in facts and circumstances 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in that period 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such uncertain tax positions could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded as a separate component in our long term income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  
table of contents which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
should that judgment change  us income taxes would have to be recognized on those undistributed earnings no longer considered to be permanently invested 
accounting for share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions per generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under gaap  share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility based upon historical volatilities of our common stock 
we determine the expected term of our share based awards based on historical exercise patterns across two different groups of employees 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the forfeiture rate on share based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to re measure the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their local currency into united states dollars 
this process results in foreign currency re measurement gains and losses included in other income  net in the consolidated income statements 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these re measurement gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including transfer pricing arrangements  billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is one consideration of determining the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
other income  net includes any gain or loss associated with the re measurement of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the united states dollar 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements into the united states dollar would be included within accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the local currency  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
as a result of this determination  assets and liabilities in these subsidiaries are re measured at current exchange rates  except for property and equipment and deferred revenue  which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are re measured at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year except for revenue and costs related to the above mentioned balance sheet items which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
accordingly  we had a net foreign currency re measurement gain of million for the year ended december  and a net foreign 
table of contents currency re measurement loss of million for the year ended december   recorded to other income  net in the respective periods 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the local currency  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our statement of stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income for each of the years presented  and would not have the impacts on our net income that are currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon fluctuations within the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies and the effect of any foreign currency hedging activities that we have entered into see note derivative instruments for details 
the company operates in a number of currencies worldwide  most notably in the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and russian ruble 
any future re measurement gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are a us dollar functional company and transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to both transaction and translation risk relating to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk originates both from our foreign operations net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses depending on the directional movement of the foreign currencies versus the us dollar and our operational profile in foreign subsidiaries 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and the correlative relationships of different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
during the twelve months ended december   we had a negative effect  or reduction  of million on total revenues and a positive effect in the form of a reduction to total expenses by million related to foreign currency fluctuation when comparing rates to in addition  for the twelve months ended december   within other income  net we had foreign currency gains of million compared to foreign currency losses of million in the comparable period in the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the australian dollar and the russian ruble 
prior to january   we did not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor did we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
however  in  we implemented a limited foreign exchange hedging program 
we now enter into hedges in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to reduce the range of outcomes foreign currency rate changes can have on non functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions  which include certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the forward foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below 
the duration of forward contracts ranges from less than one month to nine months 
a description of our accounting for forward foreign currency contracts is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivative instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the magnitude of success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
to the extent our estimates are correct  
table of contents gains and losses on our forward foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
in order to monitor the financial impact of our foreign currency hedges  we subject our hedges to a stress test 
this test is intended to quantify the impact to our financial statements of an abnormal change in the foreign currency rates in which we do business 
when subjected to a adverse change  we estimated that the fair value of our contracts would decline by million 
when subjected to a adverse change  we estimated that the fair value of our contracts would decline by million 
we do not use forward foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into forward foreign currency contracts with reputable financial institutional counterparties whose financial health we monitor 
to date  we have not experienced nonperformance by any of these counterparties and anticipate performance by all counterparties 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of nine months or less 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts for contracts outstanding at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands forward foreign currency contracts currency notional amount fair value australian dollar canadian dollar danish krone euro british pound israeli shekel russian ruble total interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we traditionally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and money market funds and articulate allocation limits in our investment policy to any one issuer other than the united states government 
our investment portfolio as of december  consisted of money market funds  auction rate securities ars  us treasuries  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify our ars as trading and all other investments as available for sale 
trading securities are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at december   we held within short term investments million with a fair value of million of ars 
the dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals is intended to provide liquidity to the holder of the ars by matching buyers and sellers within a market context enabling the holder to gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par or rolling over their investment 
the auctions for these securities began failing in february of when auctions fail  our securities earn interest based on formulaic multiples of municipal bond indices such as the jj kenny index or the s p high grade index 
the resulting interest rate has been highly sensitive to changes in the short term structure of interest rates and asset backed securities 

table of contents information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  thereafter total portfolio includes million in cash equivalents and million in our ars  which become exercisable under put options in see note cash and cash equivalents and investments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investment portfolio
