crusader acquisition bid withdrawal 
in september  we entered into a stock purchase agreement the crusader purchase agreement with crusader energy group inc  and its subsidiaries collectively  crusader to purchase all of the shares of common stock of crusader that were to be issued upon the effectiveness of crusader s reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on november   we announced our withdrawal from the acquisition process of crusader as permitted under the bidding procedures applicable to crusader s bankruptcy 
on december   we terminated the crusader purchase agreement  and on december   we received the break up fee of million provided for in the crusader purchase agreement 
business strategy our primary objective is to achieve long term growth and maximize stockholder value over multiple business cycles by pursuing the following strategies growth through development  drilling and exploration of existing acreage 
we expect to generate long term reserve and production growth by exploring  drilling and developing our large acreage position 
our primary exploration and development focus will be in the wto and the permian basin 
we have identified approximately  potential drilling locations in the wto and believe that we will be able to expand the number of drilling locations through exploratory drilling and use of our d seismic data 
we intend to complement our program in the wto through continued development of our oil reserves in the central basin platform of the permian basin 
apply technological improvements to our development and exploration program 
we use our d seismic data and our enhanced interpretation technologies to improve drilling and exploration success 
we strive to maximize value by continuing to minimize time from spud to first sales with advanced drilling  completion and production methods

index to financial statements west texas overthrust wto we have drilled and developed natural gas in the wto since this area is located in pecos county and terrell county in west texas and is associated with the marathon ouachita fold and thrust belt that extends east northeast across the united states into the appalachian mountain region 
the wto was created by the collision of the ancestral north american and south american continents resulting in source rock and reservoir rock  including potential hydrocarbon traps  becoming thrusted upon one another in multiple layers also known as imbricate stacking along the leading edge of the wto 
the collision and thrusting resulted in the reservoir rock becoming highly fractured  increasing the likelihood of conventional natural gas and oil accumulations in the reservoir rock and creating a unique geological setting in north america 
the primary reservoir rocks in the wto range in depth from  to  feet and range in geologic age from the permian to the devonian 
the imbricate stacking of these conventional gas prone reservoirs provides for multi pay exploration and development opportunities 
despite this  the wto has historically been under explored 
the high co content of the natural gas  lack of infrastructure in the region  historical limitations of conventional subsurface geological and geophysical methods and commodity prices have combined to discourage exploration of the area 
our access to and control of the necessary infrastructure combined with the application of modern seismic techniques allow us to continue to identify exploration and development opportunities in the wto 
d seismic program 
in  we began a multi year seismic program to acquire  square miles of modern d seismic data in the wto 
we believe this enhanced d seismic program will lower exploratory drilling risk and improve completion efficiency by identifying structural detail of potential reservoirs 
with the aid of d seismic data and historical well information  we believe we can high grade our drilling locations in order to achieve low finding costs 
as of december   we had acquired  square miles of d seismic data  all of which has been processed and interpreted 
pi on field 
the pi on field lies along the leading edge of the wto in pecos county and is our most significant producing field  accounting for of our proved reserve base as of december  and approximately of our exploration and development expenditures including land and seismic acquisitions 
the primary reservoirs are the tesnus sands depths ranging from  to  feet  the warwick caballos chert depths ranging from  to  feet and the dugout creek caballos chert depths ranging from  to  feet 
during  we expanded the pi on field utilizing data from our d seismic program and historical well information to identify new reservoirs in the field s three primary thrusts dugout creek  warwick and frog creek 
as of december   our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves in the pi on field were bcfe  of which were proved undeveloped reserves based on estimates prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent oil and gas consulting firm 
our interests in the pi on field as of december  included gross net producing wells and a average working interest in the producing area of the pi on field 
we were operating eight drilling rigs in the pi on field as of december  and we drilled wells in this field during the most productive reservoir in the pi on field is the warwick caballos chert high co reservoir 
however  co is a waste product and we cannot produce high co gas without removing the co from the gas stream 
production from this reservoir is currently limited by treating capacity at our legacy natural gas treating plants 
our current expansion of the capacity of our existing plants and the construction of the century plant  discussed below  will expand co treating capacity in the area and will allow us to accelerate the development of the warwick thrust 
west texas overthrust exploration update 
exploration efforts during the fourth quarter of continued to focus on the integration of  square miles of d seismic data and evolving sub surface geologic models

the century plant  to be located in pecos county  texas  is designed to have treating capacity of mmcf per day of natural gas and is expected to be completed in two phases 
the start up of phase is anticipated in mid century plant phase will add approximately mmcf per day of co treating capacity 
century plant phase is expected to come online in the second half of upon start up  the century plant will be owned and operated by occidental 
we will deliver high co natural gas to the century plant pursuant to a year treating agreement executed simultaneously with the construction agreement  and occidental will separate and remove the co from the delivered natural gas 
occidental will retain substantially all co removed at the century plant and our other existing co treating plants 
we will retain all methane from the century plant and our other existing plants 
permian basin the forest acquisition expanded our holdings in the central basin platform cbp of the permian basin and added significant permian basin production in the midland and delaware basins in texas as well as the northwest shelf in new mexico 
the primary reservoirs in the cbp are the dolomites and limestones of the san andres and clear fork formations 
to date  the san andres and clear fork zones have produced in excess of and billion barrels of oil  respectively  with typical well depths ranging from  to  feet 
our properties in the cbp are positioned for infill and step out drilling to target these reservoirs in several of the major cbp fields  such as the goldsmith  fullerton  tex mex  martin and robertson fields 
our primary target in the midland basin is the spraberry and wolfcamp formation 
the spraberry is the basinal sandstone equivalent of the clear fork platform carbonate and has produced approximately billion barrels of oil to date from wells with typical depths ranging from  to  feet

at that time  our estimated net proved reserves in east texas were bcfe  with net production of approximately mmcfe per day for the month of december we focus our operations in the cotton valley trend on the tight sand reservoirs of the pettit and travis peak formations with depths ranging from  to  feet 
these sands are typically distributed over a large area  which has led to a near drilling success rate in this area 
due to the tight nature of the reservoirs  significant hydraulic fracture stimulation is required to obtain commercial production rates and efficiently drain the reservoir 
production in this area is generally characterized as long lived  with wells having high initial production and decline rates that stabilize at lower levels after several years 
moreover  area operators continue to focus on infill development drilling as many areas have been down spaced to acres per well  with some areas down spaced to acres per well

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
to be classified as proved reserves  the project to extract the oil or gas must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty

index to financial statements reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
in determining the amount of proved reserves  the price used must be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of extractive industries oil and gas topic of the accounting standards codification with the requirements in the sec s final rule  modernization of the oil and gas reporting requirements 
key items in the new rules include changes to the pricing used to estimate reserves and calculate the full cost ceiling limitation whereby a month average price is used rather than a single day spot price  the use of new technology for determining reserves  the ability to include nontraditional resources in reserves and permitting disclosure of probable and possible reserves 
we implemented asu as of december  proved undeveloped reserves 
during  the company drilled wells and invested approximately million dollars in the development of properties that were classified as proved undeveloped at december  at december   of these wells were classified as proved developed producing properties with the remaining wells still in progress 
the month average natural gas index price of per mcf used in the estimation of reserves as of december  resulted in downward revisions of quantities associated with the company s proved undeveloped properties as a significant number of properties generated no pv value resulting in the elimination of associated reserve quantities and a shortening of the productive lives of certain proved properties that became uneconomic earlier in their lives with the use of lower natural gas prices compared to prices used in the estimation of reserves in previous periods 
there were no downward revisions as a result of the month average oil index price used in the estimation of reserves as of december

we conduct thorough credit checks with all potential purchasers and minimize our exposure by contracting with multiple parties each month 
we do not engage in any hedging activities with respect to these contracts 
we manage several interruptible natural gas transportation agreements in order to take advantage of price differentials or to secure available markets when necessary 
we currently have  mmbtu per day of firm transportation service subscribed on the oasis pipeline and  mmbtu per day on the mid continent express pipeline for a portion of our pi on field production for other operations our co capturing operations are conducted through sandridge co as of december   sandridge co owned miles of co pipelines in west texas with approximately  horsepower of owned and leased co compression available and currently operational 
the captured co is primarily used and sequestered in tertiary oil recovery operations 
as of december   sandridge co was capturing approximately mmcf per day of co we delivered the majority of this to occidental permian ltd 
and chevron corp 
in december  we captured and sold an average of mmcf of co per day and utilized mmcf per day in our enhanced oil recovery projects 
future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may provide us an opportunity to create economic benefits in the form of emissions reduction credits ercs  but such regulation may also impose burdens on the conduct and cost of our operations 
legislative and regulatory efforts may result in legal requirements that create a more active and more valuable market in which to trade ercs  although the timing and scope of future legal requirements governing greenhouse gases remain uncertain 
we currently capture approximately million metric tonnes of co per year  all of which is utilized in enhanced oil recovery projects 
the captured co may prove beneficial to us if the co capture results in ercs that can be traded or used by us to meet future regulatory compliance obligations that may otherwise be costly to satisfy 
ercs of just over million metric tonnes were sold on the voluntary market during see environmental regulations future laws and regulations 
competition we believe that our leasehold acreage position  drilling and oil field services businesses  midstream assets  co supply and technical and operational capabilities generally enable us to compete effectively 
however  the oil and gas industry is intensely competitive  and we face competition in each of our business segments 
we believe our geographic concentration of operations and vertical integration enables us to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations 
however  we compete with many companies that have greater financial and personnel resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay more for producing properties and undeveloped acreage 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low natural gas and oil market prices 
our larger or fully integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any existing and future federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry  we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing natural gas and oil properties 
with respect to our drilling business  we believe the type  age and condition of our drilling rigs  the quality of our crews and the responsiveness of our management generally enable us to compete effectively 
however  to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the extent we drill for third parties  we encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors 
our primary market area is highly competitive 
the drilling contracts we compete for are usually awarded on the basis of competitive bids 
we may  based on the economic environment at the time  determine that market conditions and profit margins are such that contract drilling for third parties is not a beneficial use of our resources 
we believe pricing and rig availability are the primary factors our potential customers consider in determining which drilling contractor to select 
while we must be competitive in our pricing  our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment and the experience of our rig crews to differentiate us from our competitors 
this strategy is less effective when demand for drilling services is weak or there is an oversupply of rigs 
these conditions usually result in increased price competition  which makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns and better retain skilled rig personnel 
we believe our geographic concentration of operations enables us to compete effectively in our midstream business segment 
most of our midstream assets are integrated with our production 
however  with respect to third party natural gas and acquisitions  we compete with companies that have greater financial and personnel resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to price their services below our prices for similar services 
we believe our supply of co and technical expertise enable us to compete effectively in our co gathering and sales business 
however  we face the same competitive pressures in this business that we do in our traditional oil field services segments 
seasonal nature of business generally  the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months 
in addition  certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer 
this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other natural gas and oil operations in a portion of our operating areas 
these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment  supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months  which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations 
environmental regulations general we are subject to extensive and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and of the health and safety of our employees 
these laws and regulations may  among other things require the acquisition of various permits before drilling or production commences  require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment  require safety related procedures and personal protective equipment to be used during operations  restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with natural gas and oil drilling production  transportation and treating activities  suspend  limit  prohibit or require approval before construction  drilling and other activities  and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from historical and ongoing operations  such as the closure of pits and plugging of abandoned wells 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these laws  rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of natural gas and oil production below the rate that would otherwise be possible 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with environmental laws  regulations and permits  and violations are subject to injunction  as well as administrative  civil and potentially criminal penalties 
the effects of these laws and regulations  as well as other laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
below is a discussion of environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability  without regard to fault or legality of conduct  on specific classes of persons for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner or operator of the site at or to which hazardous substances have been released or disposed  a former owner or operator of such site  and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of related environmental and health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
in the course of our operations  we generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
further  natural gas and oil exploration  production  treating and other activities have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators  and materials from these operations remain at and could migrate from some of our properties and may warrant or require investigation or remediation or other response action 
therefore  governmental agencies or third parties could seek to hold us responsible under cercla or similar state laws for all or part of the costs to clean up a site at or to which hazardous substances may have been released or deposited 
waste handling the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes  regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the united states environmental protection agency epa the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements 
drilling fluids  produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration  development and production of oil or natural gas are currently excluded from regulation as rcra hazardous wastes but instead are regulated under rcra s non hazardous waste provisions 
however  it is possible that certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes now classified as non hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future 
any such change would likely increase our operating expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations as well as on the industry in general 
air emissions the federal clean air act and comparable state laws control emissions of potentially harmful air emissions through permitting and monitoring regulations 
we are required to obtain various permits to ensure that emissions from our operations remain within permitted levels 
to comply with the terms of these permits  and  as part of our ongoing efforts to operate in an environmentally responsible manner  we have installed and maintained complex emission control technologies throughout our systems 
additionally  our midstream operations are developing a compliance agreement with the state agency that will allow us to achieve full compliance with air emission regulations

index to financial statements water discharges the federal water pollution control act  or the clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into waters of the united states  including wetlands  as well as state waters 
these laws prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and other substances related to the oil and gas industry into onshore  coastal and offshore waters without appropriate permits 
some of the pollutant limitations have become more restrictive over the years  and additional restrictions and limitations including technology requirements and receiving water limits  may be imposed in the future 
the clean water act also regulates storm water discharges from industrial and construction activities 
regulations promulgated by the epa and state regulatory agencies require industries engaged in certain industrial or construction activities to acquire permits and implement storm water management plans and best management practices  to conduct periodic monitoring and reporting of discharges  and to train employees 
further  federal and state regulations require certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges 
there are costs associated with each of these regulatory requirements 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and potentially criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
the oil pollution act of opa which amends and augments the clean water act  establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
in addition  opa and regulations that implement opa impose requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for clean up and natural resource damages resulting from such spills 
for example  some of our facilities in the gulf coast region must develop  implement and maintain facility response plans  conduct annual spill training for certain employees  conduct annual spill drills and provide varying degrees of financial assurance 
national environmental policy act natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands or otherwise requiring federal approval are subject to the national environmental policy act nepa 
nepa requires federal agencies  including the department of interior  to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment 
in the course of such evaluations  an agency may prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct  indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and  if necessary  will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that is made available for public review and comment 
all of our current exploration and production activities  as well as proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands  require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of nepa 
the nepa process has the potential to delay or even prohibit our development of natural gas and oil projects in covered areas 
greenhouse gases rule in october  the epa finalized and published the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule requiring certain facilities to track and report emissions of co  methane and various fluorinated hydrocarbons 
the rule applies to significant sources and or source categories of greenhouse gases and to certain suppliers of co and methane products 
generally  facilities that emit  tons per year or more of greenhouse gases are subject to this program 
initial greenhouse gas reports must be submitted to the epa in and must cover the calendar year reporting period 
the company has reviewed the final rule and has determined that the pikes peak plant  the grey ranch plant  all co compression sites and several of its natural gas compression locations are subject to these monitoring and reporting requirements 
the company has utilized the services of a third party environmental consulting company to evaluate the applicable requirements and ensure adequate monitoring and recordkeeping programs are in place and that the required information will be available for submittal on or before the applicable submission deadline 

table of contents 
index to financial statements future laws and regulations recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may contribute to warming the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the united states congress is actively considering legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 
more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
also  in july  the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse emissions under the clean air act in response to the united states supreme court s decision in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  decided in  which may result in the imposition of restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases  even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
in december  the epa announced a finding that greenhouse gases threaten the public s health and welfare 
other nations have already agreed to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases pursuant to the kyoto protocol  an international treaty pursuant to which participating countries  not including the united states  have agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to below levels by passage of climate related legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various states of the united states  or the adoption of regulations by the epa and analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business  may have an adverse effect on demand for our services or products and may result in compliance obligations with respect to the release  capture and use of carbon dioxide that could have an adverse effect on our operations 
anti terrorism measures the federal department of homeland security appropriations act of requires the department of homeland security dhs to issue regulations establishing risk based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities  including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present high levels of security risk 
the dhs issued an interim final rule in regarding risk based performance standards to be attained pursuant to the act and  on november   further issued an appendix a to the interim rules establishing chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with the interim rules 
we have not yet determined the extent to which our facilities are subject to the interim rules or the associated costs to comply  but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 
other regulation of the oil and gas industry the oil and gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state and local authorities  including native american tribes 
legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  and native american tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members  some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
although the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability  these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types  quantities and locations of production 
drilling and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal  state  local and native american tribal levels 
these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states  and some counties  municipalities and native american tribal areas where we operate also regulate one or more of the following activities the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the timing of construction or drilling activities  the rates of production or allowables  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the notice to surface owners and other third parties 
state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of natural gas and oil properties 
some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in some instances  forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production 
these laws and regulations may limit the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
federal  state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells  closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines  and for site restoration  in areas where we operate 
regulations of the minerals management service of the united states department of the interior mms require that owners and operators plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove offshore facilities located in federal offshore lease areas in a prescribed manner 
the mms requires federal leaseholders to post performance bonds or otherwise provide necessary financial assurances to provide for such abandonment  decommissioning and removal 
the new mexico oil conservation requires the posting of performance bonds to fulfill financial requirements for owners and operators on state land 
the railroad commission of texas has financial responsibility requirements for owners and operators of facilities in state waters to provide for similar assurances 
the united states army corps of engineers acoe and many other state and local municipalities have regulations for plugging and abandonment  decommissioning and site restoration 
although the acoe does not require bonds or other financial assurances  some other state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 
natural gas sales and transportation historically  federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of various federal laws enacted since have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales  which include all of our sales of our own production 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders  including the ability to assess civil penalties of million per day per violation 
ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity 
commencing in  ferc promulgated a series of orders  regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas 
today  interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers  marketers and other shippers  regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company 
ferc s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive  open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third party sellers other than pipelines 

table of contents 
index to financial statements however  the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect  if any  future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 
under ferc s current regulatory regime  transmission services must be provided on an open access  nondiscriminatory basis at cost based rates or at market based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  including more than geologists  geophysicists  petroleum engineers  technicians  land and regulatory professionals 
of our  employees  are located at our headquarters in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and the remaining employees work in our various field offices and at our drilling sites

index to financial statements existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically  based on prices used to estimate reserves  through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities

undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
in that regard i reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility  based on pricing used to estimate reserves  at greater distances 
ii undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
iii under no circumstances are estimates for undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty

item a 
risk factors natural gas and oil prices are volatile  and a decline in natural gas and oil prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices and demand for natural gas and oil 
the markets for these commodities are very volatile 
even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow 
prices for natural gas and oil may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil  the price of foreign imports  worldwide economic conditions  political and economic conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east and south america  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls

lower natural gas and oil prices  such as those experienced in recent periods  may not only decrease our revenues on a per share basis  but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
this also may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
volatility in the capital markets could affect the value of certain assets as well as our ability to obtain capital 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile due to a variety of factors  including significant write offs in the financial services sector and current weak economic conditions 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial and or operating strength 
as a result  for many companies  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished significantly 
in particular  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of lending counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduced  or in some cases ceased  to provide funding to borrowers 
in addition  lending counterparties under existing revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations 
these factors may adversely affect the value of certain of our assets and our ability to draw on our senior credit facility 
if the current credit conditions of united states and international capital markets persist or deteriorate  we may be required to impair the carrying value of assets associated with derivative contracts to account for non performance by counterparties to those contracts 
moreover  government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets may not restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit 
on october   lehman brothers commodity services  inc lehman brothers  a lender under our senior credit facility  filed for bankruptcy 
at the time that its parent  lehman brothers holdings  inc  declared bankruptcy on september   lehman brothers elected not to fund its pro rata share  or  of borrowings requested by us under the senior credit facility 
accordingly  we anticipate that lehman brothers will not fund its pro rata share of any future borrowing requests 
we currently do not expect this reduced availability of amounts under the senior credit facility to impact our liquidity or business operations 
if other financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the current conditions of the united states and international capital markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
future price declines may result in further reductions of the asset carrying values of our natural gas and oil properties 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under this accounting method  all costs for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit of production method 
however  the amount of these costs that can be carried as capitalized assets is subject to a ceiling  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved natural gas and oil reserves attributable to proved properties  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the most recent month average prices for natural gas and oil  adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as none of our derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges  the impact of our derivative contracts has been excluded from the determination of our full cost ceiling 
our ceiling limitation as of december  resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
further declines in natural gas and oil prices  without other mitigating circumstances  could result in additional losses of future net revenues  including losses attributable to quantities that cannot be economically produced at lower prices  which could cause us to make additional write downs of capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil properties and non cash charges against future earnings 
the amount of such future write downs and non cash charges could be substantial 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business 
as of december   our total indebtedness was billion  and we had preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
our substantial level of indebtedness and preferred stock outstanding increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness  combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments  could have other important consequences to us 
for example  it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and  therefore  may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
our current estimates of reserves could change  potentially in material amounts  in the future 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to production rates and economic factors such as natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures and availability of funds 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
see business our businesses and primary operations in item of this report for information about our natural gas and oil reserves 

table of contents 
index to financial statements actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report  which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our assets 
in addition  from time to time in the future  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves  potentially in material amounts  to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on month average prices and costs 
actual future net cash flows from our natural gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for natural gas and oil  the accuracy of our reserve estimates  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for natural gas and oil  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
unless we replace our natural gas and oil reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future natural gas and oil reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 
our potential drilling location inventories are scheduled over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
as of december   only of our approximately  identified potential future well locations were attributed to proved undeveloped reserves 
these potential drilling locations  including those without proved undeveloped reserves  represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  natural gas and oil prices  costs and drilling results 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations  which could adversely affect our business 
we will not know conclusively prior to drilling whether natural gas or oil will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
we describe some of our current prospects and drilling locations and our plans to explore those prospects and drilling locations in this report 
a prospect is a property on which we have identified what our geoscientists 
table of contents 
index to financial statements believe  based on available seismic and geological information  to be indications of natural gas or oil 
our prospects and drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation 
the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether natural gas or oil will be present or  if present  whether natural gas or oil will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
even if sufficient amounts of natural gas or oil exist  we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well  resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well 
during  we participated in drilling a total of gross wells  of which four were identified as dry wells 
if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry wells in our current and future prospects  our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business 
in summary  the cost of drilling  completing and operating any well is often uncertain  and new wells may not be productive 
properties that we buy may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them 
our reviews of properties we acquire are inherently incomplete because an in depth review of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as soil or ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties  and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the development of the proved undeveloped reserves in west texas and other areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
approximately of the estimated proved reserves that we owned or had under lease in west texas as of december  were proved undeveloped reserves and of our total reserves were proved undeveloped reserves 
development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
therefore  ultimate recoveries from these fields may not match current expectations 
delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the pv value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves 
a significant portion of our operations are located in west texas  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves and approximately of our production were located in the wto and permian basin in west texas 
in addition  a substantial portion of our wto natural gas contains a high concentration of co and requires treating 
as a result  we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation and treatment capacity constraints  curtailment of production or treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance or unanticipated occurrences 
such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content  which can negatively affect our economics 
the reservoirs of many of our prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content 
the natural gas produced from these reservoirs must be treated for the removal of co prior to marketing 
if we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cannot obtain sufficient capacity at treatment facilities for our natural gas with a high co concentration  or if the cost to obtain such capacity significantly increases  we could be forced to delay production and development or experience increased production costs 
we do not know the amount of co we will encounter in any well until it is drilled 
as a result  sometimes we encounter co levels in our wells that are higher than expected 
since the treatment expenses are incurred on a mcf basis  we will incur a higher effective treating cost per mmbtu of natural gas sold for natural gas with a higher co content 
as a result  high co gas wells must produce at much higher rates than low co gas wells to be economic  especially in a low natural gas price environment 
furthermore  when we treat the gas for the removal of co  some of the methane is used to run the treatment plant as fuel gas and other methane and heavier hydrocarbons  such as ethane  propane and butane  cannot be separated from the co and is lost 
this is known as plant shrink 
historically our plant shrink has been approximately in the wto 
after giving effect to plant shrink  as many as mcf of high conatural gas must be produced to sell one mmbtu of natural gas 
we report our volumes of natural gas reserves and production net of co volumes that are removed prior to sales 
all of our consolidated drilling and services revenues are derived from companies in the oil and gas industry 
companies to which we provide drilling and related services are affected by the oil and gas industry risks mentioned above 
market prices of natural gas and oil  limited access to capital and reductions in capital expenditures could result in oil and gas companies canceling or curtailing their drilling programs  which could reduce the demand for our drilling and related services 
any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities  whether resulting from changes in natural gas and oil prices or otherwise  could impact our drilling and services segment by negatively affecting revenues  cash flow and profitability  our ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for drilling and related services  and the fair value of our rig fleet 
a significant decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operations  due to the decline in production from existing wells  depressed commodity prices or otherwise  would adversely affect our ability to satisfy certain contractual obligations and revenues and cash flow from our midstream gas services segment 
in june  we sold an entity  pi on gathering company  llc pgc  holding our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field to an unaffiliated third party 
in conjunction with the sale  we entered into a gas gathering agreement pursuant to which we dedicated our pi on field acreage to pgc for gathering services for years 
during that period  we have minimum throughput and delivery obligations to pgc 
in addition  we continue to construct and acquire our own gathering and compression assets in the pi on field 
most of the reserves supporting our contractual obligations to pgc and our own midstream assets are operated by our exploration and production segment 
a material decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to pgc s and our pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and treating 
we have no control over many factors affecting production activity  including prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
our throughput and delivery obligations to pgc may not be satisfied if we do not connect new wells to pgc s gathering systems or if there is a decline in natural gas that we produce from the pi on field  however  we would still be obligated to pay fees under the gas gathering agreement 
failure to connect new wells to our own gathering systems would result in the amount of natural gas we gather  transport and treat being reduced substantially over time and could  upon exhaustion of the current wells  cause us to abandon our gathering systems and  possibly cease gathering  transporting and treating operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our use of d and d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas and oil 
in addition  the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures  which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 
a significant aspect of our exploration and development plan involves seismic data 
even when properly used and interpreted  d and d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are present in those structures 
other geologists and petroleum professionals  when studying the same seismic data  may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals 
in addition  the use of d and d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and we could incur losses due to such expenditures 
as a result  our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical  and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve 
we often gather d and d seismic data over large areas 
our interpretation of seismic data delineates for us those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling 
therefore  we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data  and in many cases  we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location 
if we are not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms  we will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze d and d data without having an opportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures 
drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable if dry wells are drilled and if productive wells do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations  pressures  fires  blowouts  loss of drilling fluid circulation  title problems  facility or equipment malfunctions  unexpected operational events  shortages of skilled personnel  shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services  compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements  and adverse weather conditions 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses  including personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties 
insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 
additionally  we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we could incur losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition and results of operations 
the high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs of rigs  equipment  supplies and personnel are substantially greater and their availability may be limited 
additionally  these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production 
market conditions or a lack of satisfactory natural gas and oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of natural gas and oil and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends  in substantial part  on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and treating facilities 
for example  we are currently experiencing capacity limitations on high co gas treating in the pi on field 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms or expand our midstream assets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to natural gas pipelines  gathering system capacity or treating facilities may be limited or unavailable 
we would be unable to realize revenue from any shut in wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
if events of this nature occur and persist  the attendant political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas  potentially putting downward pressure on prevailing oil and natural gas prices and causing a reduction in our revenues 
oil and natural gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks  and or operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our operations is destroyed by such an attack 
costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats  and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain  if available at all 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves 
the natural gas and oil industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration  development  production and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity  debt and cash generated by operations 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with the sale of equity and debt securities  cash flow from operations  asset sales and current and new financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of natural gas and oil we are able to produce from existing wells  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the prices at which natural gas and oil are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas and oil prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
in order to fund our capital expenditures  we may seek additional financing 
our senior credit facility and senior note indentures  however  contain covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness without the consent of the lenders 
our lenders may withhold this consent at their sole discretion 
continuing disruptions in the global financial and capital markets also could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves 
the agreements governing our existing indebtedness have restrictions  financial covenants and borrowing base redeterminations which could adversely affect our operations 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to obtain additional financing  make investments  lease equipment  sell assets and engage in business combinations 
we also are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
if commodity prices remain at their current level for an extended period or continue to decline  this could adversely affect our ability to meet covenants 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the senior credit facility  senior notes or other debt financing could result in a default under those instruments  which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
our senior credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount 
the borrowing base is subject to review semi annually  however  the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re determination of the borrowing base per calendar year 
unscheduled re determinations may be made at our request  but are limited to two requests per year 
the borrowing base is determined based upon proved developed producing reserves  proved developed non producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately  or we must pledge other natural gas and oil properties as additional collateral 
we do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties  and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments under the senior credit facility  which are required  for example  when we exceed our committed line of credit  fail to reinvest proceeds of asset sales in new natural gas and oil properties or incur indebtedness that is not permitted by the terms of the senior credit facility 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and senior notes were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
our derivative activities could result in financial losses and could reduce our earnings 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil  we currently  and may in the future  enter into derivative contracts for a portion of our natural gas and oil production  including collars  basis swaps and fixed price swaps 
as of december   we had natural gas price swaps of bcfe at an average price of per mcfe in place for and oil price swaps of  mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for   mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for and  mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for the company also has natural gas basis swaps in place through for bcf at an average price of per mcf 
we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative contracts 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on our balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts are recognized in current period earnings 
accordingly  our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative contracts 
derivative contracts also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received 
in addition  these types of derivative contracts limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
the oil and gas industry is intensely competitive  and we compete with companies that have greater resources than we do 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce natural gas and oil  but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas and oil properties and exploratory prospects or identify  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low natural gas and oil market prices 
our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal  state  local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry  we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing natural gas and oil properties 
see business competition in item of this report 
downturns in natural gas and oil prices can result in decreased oil field activity which  in turn  can result in an oversupply of service providers and drilling rigs 
this oversupply can result in severe reductions in prices received for oil field services or a complete lack of work for crews and equipment 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting our operations 
our natural gas and oil exploration  production  transportation and treatment operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
for instance  we may be unable to obtain all necessary permits  approvals and certificates for proposed projects 
alternatively  we may have to incur substantial expenditures to obtain  maintain or renew authorizations to conduct existing projects 
if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or public opposition  we may suffer expensive delays  extended periods of non operation or significant loss of value in a project 
such costs may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with authority relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  natural gas and oil 
failure to comply with such laws and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements regulations  as interpreted and enforced  could have a material adverse effect on us 
for instance  the mms may suspend or terminate our operations on federal leases for failure to pay royalties or comply with safety and environmental regulations 
our operations expose us to potentially substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental  health and safety matters 
we may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of environmental  health and safety requirements applicable to our natural gas and oil exploration  development  production  transportation  treatment  and other activities 
these costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of environmental  health and safety laws that cover  among other things  emissions into the air and water  habitat and endangered species protection  the containment and disposal of hazardous substances  oil field waste and other waste materials  the use of underground injection wells  and wetlands protection 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly strict over time 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws or regulations may result in assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and the issuance of orders enjoining or limiting our current or future operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations also increases the cost of our operations and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation 
specifically  we may incur increased expenditures in the future in order to maintain compliance with laws and regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from our natural gas treatment plants 
see business environmental regulations in item of this report 
certain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability that may require us to pay for or incur the costs to remediate contaminated properties regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were or were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
in addition  claims for damages to persons  property or natural resources may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations 
moreover  new or modified environmental  health or safety laws  regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs 
therefore  the costs to comply with environmental  health or safety laws or regulations or the liabilities incurred in connection with such compliance could significantly and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  many countries as well as several states and regions of the united states have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane  a primary component of natural gas  in response to scientific studies suggesting that these gases may be contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere 
on the united states federal level  congress is currently considering and president obama has expressed support for legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 
the epa s final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule  which requires reporting of certain greenhouse gas emissions  became effective december  regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely impact some of our operations and demand for some of our services or products in the future

the century plant may not be constructed  operate or perform as intended 
there are significant risks associated with the construction  operation and performance of a project such as the century plant 
there are a limited number of firms and individuals with the expertise and experience necessary to complete construction projects of this size and nature 
there is no assurance that the materials necessary for construction of the plant will be in ready supply when we need them or delivered to us on a timely basis 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete construction of the century plant within the time frame currently anticipated  and we could experience cost overruns that will not be covered by occidental under our contract with occidental

index to financial statements we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire other companies or large asset packages 
most recently  we completed the forest acquisition in december we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information  human resources and other administrative systems  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems  liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business  exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with  or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of  an acquisition  including but not limited to  claims from terminated employees  customers  former stockholders or other third parties  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  and potential incompatibility of business cultures 
if we fail to maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting  it could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our results 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in our internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent material fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful  and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future  including future compliance with the obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of any failure to develop or maintain effective controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  including those related to acquired businesses  or other effective improvement of our internal controls could harm our operating results 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
president obama s proposed fiscal year budget included proposed legislation that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to united states tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas 
table of contents 
index to financial statements properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of new derivatives legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
congress is currently considering legislation to impose restrictions on certain transactions involving derivatives  which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
the wall street reform and consumer protection act of  which was approved by the us house of representatives on december   would subject over the counter otc derivative dealers and major otc derivative market participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including by imposing conservative capital and margin requirements and strict business conduct standards 
derivative contracts that are not cleared through central clearinghouses or exchanges may be subject to substantially higher capital and margin requirements 
in addition  the american clean energy and security act of  also known as the waxman markey cap and trade legislation or acesa  which was approved by the us house of representatives on june   contains provisions that would prohibit private otc energy commodity derivative and hedging transactions 
acesa would expand the power of the commodity futures trading commission the cftc to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities  including oil and natural gas  and to mandate clearance of such derivative contracts through registered derivative clearing organizations 
under acesa  the cftc s expanded authority over energy derivatives would terminate upon the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform 
on january   the cftc proposed rules to establish position limits on derivatives that reference major energy commodities  including natural gas and oil 
the proposed all months combined position limits would be of the first  contracts of open interest and of open interest beyond  contracts 
the cftc s proposal includes an exemption for bona fide hedges relating to inventory or anticipatory purchases or sales of the commodity 
the cftc also is evaluating whether position limits should be applied consistently across all markets and participants 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the specific content of any derivatives legislation that may ultimately be enacted  any such laws or regulations that are adopted that subject us to additional capital or margin requirements relating to  or to additional restrictions on  our trading and commodity positions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process and impose additional regulatory burdens on our industry 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of bills currently pending before the senate and house of representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
the proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business

index to financial statements climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the gas and oil that we produce 
on december   the epa announced its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment because emissions of such gases  according to the epa  contribute to warming the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes 
these findings by the epa allow it to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in september  the epa proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings 
the proposed regulations would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and also could require permits for emitting greenhouse gas from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states  beginning in for emissions occurring in the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the gas and oil we produce 
also  on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  the acesa which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane  that may contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes 
the acesa would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from levels by and just over an reduction of such emissions by under this legislation  the epa would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases 
the net effect of the acesa would be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products and natural gas 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions  and president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the united states senate may act on this or other climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the united states senate would be reconciled with the acesa  any federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the gas and oil we produce

overview of our company we are an independent natural gas and oil company concentrating on exploration  development and production activities related to the exploitation of our significant holdings in west texas 
our primary areas of focus are the wto and the permian basin 
the wto is a natural gas prone geological region where we have operated since the wto includes the pi on gas field 
we completed numerous acquisitions of additional working interests in the wto during and additionally  we focus on the exploration  development and production of our properties in the permian basin including properties recently acquired from forest  as discussed below 
we also operate interests in the mid continent  the cotton valley trend in east texas  the gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
we currently generate the majority of our consolidated revenues and cash flow from the production and sale of natural gas and oil 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil and on our ability to find and economically develop and produce natural gas and oil reserves 
prices for natural gas and oil fluctuate widely 
in order to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations  we enter into derivative commodity contracts for a portion of our anticipated future natural gas and oil production 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital expenditure programs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we operate businesses that are complementary to our exploration  development and production activities 
we own related gas gathering and treating facilities  a gas marketing business and an oil field services business 
the extent to which each of these supplemental businesses contributes to our consolidated results of operations largely is determined by the amount of work each performs for third parties 
revenues and costs related to work performed by these businesses for our own account are eliminated in consolidation and  therefore  do not contribute to our consolidated results of operations 
recent developments forest acquisition 
in december  we purchased natural gas and oil properties located in the permian basin from forest for million  subject to purchase price and post closing adjustments 
for more information about the forest acquisition  see item  business recent developments 
common stock offering 
in december  we completed a registered underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  including  shares of common stock acquired by the underwriters from us to cover over allotments 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the forest acquisition purchase price and for general corporate purposes 
senior notes due in december  we completed the sale of million of our unsecured senior notes to qualified institutional buyers eligible under rule a of the securities act 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after the issuance discount and deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
we used such proceeds to fund a portion of the forest acquisition purchase price 
private placement of convertible perpetual preferred stock 
in december  we completed a private placement of  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock to an institutional investor in a transaction exempt from registration under regulation d under the securities act 
net proceeds were approximately million and were used to fund a portion of the forest acquisition purchase price and for general corporate purposes 
each share of the convertible perpetual preferred stock has a liquidation preference of and is entitled to an annual dividend of payable semi annually in cash  common stock or any combination thereof  beginning on july  additionally  each share is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  at the holder s option  at any time on or after february  based on an initial conversion price of and subject to customary adjustments in certain circumstances 
five years after their issuance  all outstanding shares of the convertible preferred stock will be converted automatically into shares of our common stock at the then prevailing conversion price as long as all dividends accrued at that time have been paid

index to financial statements exploration and production segment the primary factors affecting the financial results of our exploration and production segment are the prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production  the quantity of natural gas and oil we produce and changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts we use to reduce the volatility of the prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
annual comparisons of production and price data are presented in the following tables

for the month period ended december   the prices used in our external and internal reserve reports yield weighted average wellhead prices of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil based on index prices used per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil at december  
the sec requires public companies utilizing the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties to perform a ceiling limitation calculation at the end of each quarterly and annual reporting period 
as a result of lower natural gas and oil prices during  which were used to determine the future value of our reserves  we were required to record a ceiling impairment of million at december   in addition to the  million ceiling impairment recorded at march  exploration and production segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  exploration and production segment revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in  as a result of a decrease in the average price we received for the natural gas and oil we produced  offset slightly by a increase in combined production volumes 
during  we increased natural gas production slightly by mmcf to bcf and increased oil production by mbbls to  mbbls 
the total combined bcfe increase in production is primarily due to the increased oil production resulting from new wells in west texas and the permian basin 
the average price we received for our natural gas production for the year ended december  decreased per mcf  or  to per mcf from per mcf in the average price received for our oil production decreased to per bbl from per bbl in the average price we received for our natural gas and oil production was negatively impacted by the continued decline in natural gas and oil prices experienced by the industry during including the impact of derivative contract settlements  the effective average price received for natural gas for the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf during our oil derivative contract settlements increased our effective price received for oil by per bbl to per bbl for the year ended december  our oil derivative contract settlements decreased our effective price received for oil by per bbl to per bbl for the year ended december  during and  we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our production through due to the long term nature of our investment in the development of our properties  we enter into natural gas and oil swaps and natural gas basis swaps for a portion of our production in order to stabilize future cash inflows for planning purposes 
our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges and  as a result  gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
internally  management views the settlement of such derivative contracts as adjustments to the price received for natural gas and oil production to determine effective prices 
during the year ended december   the exploration and production segment reported a million net gain on our commodity derivative contracts million realized gain and million unrealized loss compared to a million net gain million realized losses and million unrealized gain in unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts represent the change in fair value of open derivative contracts during the period 
the unrealized loss on natural gas and oil derivative contracts recorded during the year ended december  is attributable to an increase in average natural gas and oil prices at december  compared to the average natural gas and oil prices at december  or the contract price for contracts entered into during the realized gain of million for the year ended december  is primarily due to a decline in natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price

on a consolidated basis  midstream and marketing revenues represent natural gas sold on behalf of third parties and the fees we charge related to gathering  compressing and treating this gas 
gas marketing operating costs represent payments made to third parties for the proceeds from the sale of gas owned by such parties  net of any applicable margin and actual costs to gather  compress and treat the gas that we charge 
the primary factors affecting midstream gas services are the quantity of natural gas we gather  treat and market and the prices we pay and receive for natural gas 
in june  we completed the sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field of the wto 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million  which resulted in a loss on the sale of million 
the sale of these assets did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on our future consolidated results of operations 
in conjunction with the sale  we entered into a gas gathering agreement and an operations and maintenance agreement 
under the gas gathering agreement  we have dedicated our pi on field acreage for priority gathering services for a period of years and we will pay a fee for such services that was negotiated at arms length

production taxes decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  as a result of severance tax refunds totaling approximately million in and the decreased prices received for production 
as a result  production taxes on a unit of production basis decreased from per mcfe for to per mcfe for drilling and services expenses  which include operating expenses attributable to the drilling and oil field services segment and our co services companies  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to less rig activity and lower profit margins in  which resulted in a lower amount of costs associated with the drilling business being allocated to the full cost pool and an increased amount of such costs being expensed

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow generated from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility  the issuance of equity and debt securities  and to a lesser extent  the sale of assets 
our primary uses of capital are expenditures related to our natural gas and oil properties and other fixed assets  the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties and the repayment of amounts outstanding on our senior credit facility and interest payments on our outstanding debt 
we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital funding requirements through our senior credit facility 
working capital our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
absent any significant effects from our commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital because our capital spending generally has exceeded our cash flows from operations and we generally use excess cash to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit arrangements 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million compared to a deficit of million at december  current assets decreased million at december   compared to current assets at december   primarily due to a million decrease in our current derivative contract assets resulting from the increase in natural gas and oil market prices compared to the contract prices 
current liabilities decreased million primarily as a result of a decrease of million in accounts payable 
cash flows our cash flows for the years ended december   and are presented in the following table and discussed below year ended december  in thousands cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flow is mainly influenced by the prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production  the quantity of natural gas we produce and  to a lesser extent  the quantity of oil we produce  the demand for our drilling rigs and oil field services and the rates we are able to charge for these services  and the margins we obtain from our natural gas and co gathering and treating contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to is primarily due to our million decrease in revenues as a result of our decrease in prices received on our production during these decreases were partially offset by increases in realized gains on our commodity derivative contracts settled during cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in primarily due to our million increase in revenues as a result of our increase in production volumes related to our drilling activities during these increases were partially offset by increases in midstream and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs such as salaries and wages 
cash flows from investing activities we dedicate and expect to continue to dedicate a substantial portion of our capital expenditure program toward the exploration  development  production and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
these capital expenditures are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive natural gas and oil industry 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased to  million during from  million in due to the reduction in our capital expenditure program in capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  decreased  million to million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the same period in primarily due to our decreased drilling activities 
the decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures was partially offset by the forest acquisition which resulted in million of cash outflows in cash outflows from capital expenditures in were partially offset by approximately million in combined net proceeds from the sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field and our deep drilling rights in east texas

our senior credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  currently million 
the borrowing base is subject to review semi annually  however  the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re determination of the borrowing base per calendar year 
we may request up to two unscheduled re determinations per year 
the borrowing base is determined based upon proved developed producing reserves  proved developed non producing reserves  and proved undeveloped reserves 
our borrowing base is redetermined in april and october of each year based on proved reserves 
because the value of our proved reserves is a key factor in determining the amount of the borrowing base  our success in developing reserves  as well as changing commodity prices  may affect the borrowing base of our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility contains various covenants that limit the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to grant certain liens  make certain loans and investments  make distributions  redeem stock  redeem or prepay debt  merge or consolidate with or into a third party  or engage in certain asset dispositions  including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
additionally  the senior credit facility limits the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness with certain exceptions 
the senior credit facility also contains financial covenants  including maintaining agreed levels for the i ratio of total funded debt to ebitdax as defined in the senior credit facility  which may not exceed at each quarter end calculated using the last four completed fiscal quarters  ii ratio of ebitdax to interest expense plus current maturities of

outlook for  we have budgeted million for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
the majority of our capital expenditures will be discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels or we are unable to obtain capital on attractive terms 
we may increase or decrease planned capital expenditures depending on natural gas prices  asset sales and the availability of capital through the issuance of additional long term debt or equity 
our revenue  profitability and future growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for natural gas and oil  each of which depend on numerous factors beyond our control such as economic conditions  regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources 
the energy markets historically have been volatile and natural gas and oil prices in were substantially lower than in and and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future 
our derivative arrangements serve to mitigate a portion of the effect of this price volatility on our cash flows  and while derivative contracts for the majority of expected  and oil production are in place  there are no fixed price swap derivative contracts in place for our natural gas production beyond in addition  we will need to incur capital expenditures in to achieve production targets required to meet our commitments to deliver gas under certain gathering and treating arrangements 
we are dependent on availability under the senior credit facility  along with cash flows from operating activities  to fund those capital expenditures 
based on anticipated natural gas and oil prices and availability under the senior credit facility  we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures for however  a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices and or less than anticipated new production could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that may be economically produced and could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the senior credit facility  which in turn would limit further borrowings to fund capital expenditures

as of february   our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million  the balance outstanding under our senior credit facility was million and we had million outstanding in letters of credit 
if future capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow and cash on hand  funds would likely be supplemented as needed by borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we may choose to refinance borrowings outstanding under the facility by issuing long term debt or equity in the public or private markets  or both 
debt and equity capital markets experienced adverse conditions during the latter part of and into continued volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt due to increased interest rates  and may affect our ability to access these markets 
currently  we do not believe our liquidity has been  or in the near future will be  materially affected by recent events in the global financial markets 
nevertheless  we continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders under our senior credit facility 
to date  the only disruption in our ability to access the full amounts available under our senior credit facility was the bankruptcy of lehman brothers  a lender responsible for of the obligations under our senior credit facility 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruptions in the credit markets 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe our cash flow from operations  current cash on hand and availability under our senior credit facility  together with potential access to the credit markets  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures budget  debt service requirements and working capital needs for the next months

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
see note summary of organization and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued asu to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of extractive industries oil and gas topic of the accounting standards codification with the requirements in the sec s final rule  modernization of the oil and gas reporting requirements 
we implemented asu as of december  key items in the new rules include changes to the pricing used to estimate reserves and calculate the full cost ceiling limitation whereby a month average price is used rather than a single day spot price  the use of new technology for determining reserves  the ability to include nontraditional resources in reserves and permitting disclosure of probable and possible reserves 
proved reserves 
approximately of our reserves are estimated on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of natural gas and oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data  and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  as a result of volatility and changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period  causing estimates of proved reserves to change  as well as causing estimates of future net revenues to change 
for the years ended december   and  we revised our proved reserves from prior years reports by approximately  bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively  due to market prices during or at the end of the applicable period or production performance indicating more or less reserves in place or larger or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated or additional proved reserve bookings within the original field boundaries 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
these revisions may be material and could materially affect our future depreciation and depletion expenses 
method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we follow the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry well costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding natural gas and oil reserves 
amortization of natural gas and oil properties is provided using the unit of production method based on estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
sales and abandonments of natural gas and oil properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved natural gas and oil reserves 
a significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than of the reserve quantities of a cost center 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well  lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool 
table of contents 
index to financial statements basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs are subject to a limitation 
the capitalized cost of natural gas and oil properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved natural gas and oil reserves  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  plus estimated salvage value  less related tax effects the ceiling limitation 
beginning with the december  calculation  our full cost ceiling limitation is calculated using the month average natural gas and oil prices for the most recent months as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
prior to december   the full cost ceiling limitation calculation required companies to use natural gas and oil prices on the last day of the period 
if capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
during the year ended december   total capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil properties exceeded our ceiling limitation resulting in a non cash ceiling impairment of  million  million of which was incurred in the fourth quarter under the current sec rule and  million of which was incurred in the first quarter under the rules in effect at the time 
for the year ended december   total capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil properties exceeded our ceiling limitation resulting in a non cash ceiling impairment of  million calculated under the previous rules 
unevaluated properties 
the balance of unevaluated properties consists of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with capitalized interest costs for these projects 
these costs are initially excluded from our amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined or  generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess our properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
our assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
we estimate that substantially all of our costs classified as unproved as of the balance sheet date will be evaluated and transferred within a six year period from the date of acquisition  contingent on our capital expenditures and drilling program 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated future abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines and other facilities 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability based on third party quotes and current actual costs 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
revenue recognition and gas balancing 
natural gas and oil revenues are recorded when title passes to the customer  net of royalties  discounts and allowances  as applicable 
we account for natural gas and oil production imbalances using the sales method  whereby we recognize revenue on all natural gas and oil sold to our customers notwithstanding the fact that its ownership may be less than of the natural gas and oil sold 
liabilities are recorded for imbalances greater than our proportionate share of remaining estimated natural gas and oil reserves 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we recognize revenues and expenses generated from day work drilling contracts as the services are performed  since we do not bear the risk of completion of the well 
we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel 
mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
the contract terms typically range from to days 
midstream gas services segment revenues consist mostly of gas marketing revenue  however  gas marketing is a very low margin business 
midstream gas services are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  and provide value added services to customers 
on a consolidated basis  midstream and marketing revenues represent natural gas sold on behalf of third parties and the fees we charge related to gathering  compressing and treating this gas 
gas marketing operating costs represent payments made to third parties for the proceeds from the sale of gas owned by such parties  net of any applicable margin and actual costs to gather  compress and treat the gas that we charge 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by our midstream gas business is priced at a published daily or monthly index price 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
the primary factors affecting midstream gas services are the quantity of natural gas we gather  treat and market and the prices we pay and receive for natural gas 
revenue from sales of co is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
we recognize service fees related to the transportation of co as revenue when the related service is provided 
property  plant and equipment  net 
other capitalized costs  including drilling equipment  natural gas gathering and treating equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
depreciation of drilling equipment is recorded using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
when property and equipment components are disposed of  the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years tax returns 
as of december   we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax position changed from a net deferred tax liability as of december  to a net deferred tax asset as of december  due to the recording of a full cost ceiling impairment of  million 
the valuation allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more

we increased the valuation allowance for the period ended december  by million as a result of not recording a benefit for the current period net loss attributable to us before income taxes of  million 
derivative financial instruments 
to manage risks related to increases in interest rates and changes in natural gas and oil prices  we enter into interest rate swaps and natural gas and oil futures contracts 
we recognize all of our derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative contract depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
for those derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments  we designate the hedging instrument  based on the exposure being hedged  as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
for derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments  the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
none of our derivatives was designated as hedging instruments during  and new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the discussion in this section provides information about the financial instruments we use to manage commodity prices and interest rate volatility 
all contracts are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity at settlement 
commodity price risk 
our most significant market risk relates to the prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
due to the historical volatility of these commodities  we periodically have entered into  and expect in the future to enter into  derivative arrangements for the purpose of reducing the variability of natural gas and oil prices we receive for our production 
from time to time  we enter into commodity pricing derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated production volumes depending upon management s view of opportunities under the then current market conditions 
we do not intend to enter into derivative contracts that would exceed our expected production volumes for the period covered by the derivative arrangement 
our current credit agreement limits our ability to enter into derivative transactions to of expected production volumes from estimated proved reserves 
future credit agreements could require a minimum level of commodity price hedging 
the use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations under the contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
as of december   we had approved derivative counterparties  of which are lenders under our senior credit facility 
we currently have derivative contracts outstanding with of these counterparties 
we have no derivative contracts in and beyond with counterparties other than those that are lenders under our senior credit facility 
we use  and may continue to use  a variety of commodity based derivative contracts  including collars  fixed price swaps and basis protection swaps 
our fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon new york mercantile exchange prices  and our basis protection swap transactions are settled based upon the index price of natural gas at the waha hub  a west texas gas marketing and delivery center and the houston ship channel 
settlement for natural gas derivative contracts occurs in the production month 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes 
we record all derivative contracts on the balance sheet at fair value  which reflects changes in natural gas and oil prices 
we establish fair value of our derivative contracts by price quotations obtained from counterparties to the derivative contracts 
changes in fair values of our derivative contracts are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings 
as a result  our current period earnings may be significantly affected by changes in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
changes in fair value are principally measured based on period end prices compared to the contract price

a portion of our liquidity is concentrated in derivative contracts that enable us to mitigate a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility 
we periodically review the credit quality of each counterparty to our derivative contracts and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty to limit our credit risk exposure with respect to these contracts 
additionally  we apply a credit default risk rating factor for our counterparties in determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
the counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating 
the weighted average credit default swap rate for our counterparties was and at december  and  respectively 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure budget is partially dependent upon the availability of funds under our senior credit facility 
in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with individual financial institutions committed to participate in our senior credit facility  our bank group consists of financial institutions with commitments ranging from to 
lehman brothers  a lender under our senior credit facility  declared bankruptcy on october  as a result of the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and its parent company  lehman brothers holdings inc  on september   lehman brothers elected not to fund its pro rata share  or  of borrowings requested by us under the facility

index to financial statements amount available under the senior credit facility to impact our liquidity or business operations  the inability of one or more of our other lenders to fund their obligations under the facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed and variable interest rate borrowings 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to i changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and ii the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
variable rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates as our interest obligations on these instruments are periodically redetermined based on prevailing market interest rates  primarily libor and the federal funds rate 
in addition to commodity price derivative arrangements  we may enter into derivative transactions to fix the interest we pay on a portion of the money we borrow under our credit agreement 
in january  we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution that effectively fixed the interest rate on our variable rate term loan for the period from april  through april  as a result of the exchange of our variable rate term loan to senior floating rate notes  the interest rate swap is now used to fix the variable libor interest rate on the senior floating rate notes at through april in may  we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution that effectively fixed the interest rate on our senior floating rate notes at for the period from april  through april  these swaps have not been designated as hedges 
our interest rate swaps reduce our market risk on our senior floating rate notes 
we use sensitivity analyses to determine the impact that market risk exposures could have on our variable interest rate borrowings if not for our interest rate swaps 
based on the million outstanding balance of our senior floating rate notes at december   a one percent change in the applicable rates  with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a change in our interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  unrealized gain of million and unrealized loss of million were recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized loss of million and realized gain of million were included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations for years ended december  and  respectively
