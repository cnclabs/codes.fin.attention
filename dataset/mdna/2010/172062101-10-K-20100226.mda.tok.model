item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which begins on page commercial lines property casualty insurance segment the commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of billion to total revenues  or percent of that total  and reported a loss before income taxes of million in commercial lines net earned premiums declined percent and percent in and after growing percent in approximately percent of our commercial lines premiums are written to provide accounts with coverages from more than one of our business lines 
as a result  we believe that our commercial lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis 
however  we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for our business lines 
the seven commercial business lines are commercial casualty commercial casualty insurance provides coverage to businesses against third party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations  including liability coverage for injuries sustained from products sold as well as coverage for professional services  such as dentistry 
specialized casualty policies may include liability coverage for employment practices liability epli  which protects businesses against claims by employees that their legal rights as employees of the company have been violated  and other acts or failures to act under specified circumstances as well as excess insurance and umbrella liability  including personal umbrella liability written as an endorsement to commercial umbrella coverages 
the commercial casualty business line includes liability coverage written on both a discounted and non discounted basis as part of commercial package policies 
commercial property commercial property insurance provides coverage for loss or damage to buildings  inventory and equipment caused by covered causes of loss such as fire  wind  hail  water  theft and vandalism  as well as business interruption resulting from a covered loss 
commercial property also includes crime insurance  which provides coverage for losses such as embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee  among others  and inland marine insurance  which provides coverage for a variety of mobile equipment  such as contractor s equipment  builder s risk  cargo and electronic data processing equipment 
various property coverages can be written as stand alone policies or can be added to a package policy 
the commercial property business line includes property coverage written on both a non discounted and discounted basis as part of commercial package policies 
commercial auto commercial auto coverages protect businesses against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage  medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicles  physical damage to an insured s own vehicle from collision and various other perils  and damages caused by uninsured motorists 
workers compensation workers compensation coverage protects employers against specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees 
we write workers compensation coverage in all of our active states except north dakota  ohio and washington  where coverage is provided solely by the state instead of by private insurers 
specialty packages specialty packages include coverages for property  liability and business interruption tailored to meet the needs of specific industry classes  such as artisan contractors  page dentists  garage operators  financial institutions  metalworkers  printers  religious institutions  or smaller  main street businesses 
businessowners policies  which combine property  liability and business interruption coverages for small businesses  are included in specialty packages 
surety and executive risk this business line includes o contract and commercial surety bonds  which guarantee a payment or reimbursement for financial losses resulting from dishonesty  failure to perform and other acts 
o fidelity bonds  which cover losses that policyholders incur as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals or dishonest acts by employees 
o director and officer liability insurance  which covers liability for actual or alleged errors in judgment  breaches of duty or other wrongful acts related to activities of for profit or nonprofit organizations 
our director and officer liability policy can optionally include epli coverage 
machinery and equipment specialized machinery and equipment coverage can provide protection for loss or damage to boilers and machinery  including production and computer equipment  from sudden and accidental mechanical breakdown  steam explosion or artificially generated electrical current 
our emphasis is on products that agents can market to small to mid size businesses in their communities 
of our  reporting agency locations  nine market only our surety and executive risk products and five market only our personal lines products 
the remaining  locations  located in all states in which we actively market  offer some or all of our standard market commercial insurance products 
in  our highest volume commercial lines states generated percent of our earned premiums compared with percent in the prior year as we continued efforts to geographically diversify our property casualty risks 
earned premiums in the highest volume states decreased percent in and decreased percent in the remaining states 
the number of reporting agency locations in our highest volume states increased to in from in commercial lines earned premiums by state dollars in millions earned premiums of total earned agency locations average premium per location year ended december  ohio illinois pennsylvania indiana north carolina michigan virginia georgia wisconsin iowa year ended december  ohio illinois pennsylvania indiana north carolina virginia michigan georgia wisconsin tennessee for new commercial lines business  case by case underwriting and pricing is coordinated by our locally based field marketing representatives 
our agents and our field marketing  claims  loss control  premium audit  bond and machinery and equipment representatives get to know the people and businesses in their communities and can make informed decisions about each risk 
these field marketing representatives also are responsible for selecting new independent agencies  coordinating field teams of specialized company representatives and promoting all of the company s products within the agencies they serve 
commercial lines policy renewals are managed by headquarters underwriters who are assigned to specific agencies and consult with local field staff as needed 
as part of our team approach  the headquarters underwriter also helps oversee agency growth and profitability 
they are responsible for formal issuance of all new business and renewal policies as well as policy endorsements 
further  the headquarters underwriters provide day to day customer service to agencies and marketing representatives by offering product training  answering underwriting questions  helping to determine underwriting eligibility and assisting with the mechanics of premium determination 
page our commercial lines packages are typically offered on a three year policy term for most insurance coverages  a key competitive advantage 
in our experience  multi year packages appeal to the quality conscious insurance buyers who we believe are typical clients of our independent agents 
customized insurance programs on a three year term complement the long term relationships these policyholders typically have with their agents and with the company 
by reducing annual administrative efforts  multi year policies lower expenses for our company and for our agents 
the commitment we make to policyholders encourages long term relationships and reduces their need to annually re evaluate their insurance carrier or agency 
we believe that the advantages of three year policies in terms of improved policyholder convenience  increased account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage of these policies  even in periods of rising rates 
although we offer three year policy terms  premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at anniversary for the next annual period  and policies may be canceled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder 
contract terms often provide that rates for property  general liability  inland marine and crime coverages  as well as policy terms and conditions  are fixed for the term of the policy 
the general liability exposure basis may be audited annually 
commercial auto  workers compensation  professional liability and most umbrella liability coverages within multi year packages are rated at each of the policy s annual anniversaries for the next one year period 
the annual pricing could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual anniversary date  as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or debits relating to loss experience and other underwriting judgment factors 
we estimate that approximately percent of commercial premiums were subject to annual rating or were written on a one year policy term 
staying abreast of evolving market conditions is a critical function  accomplished in both an informal and a formal manner 
informally  our field marketing representatives and underwriters are in constant receipt of market intelligence from the agencies with which they work 
formally  our commercial lines product management group and field marketing associates conduct periodic surveys to obtain competitive intelligence 
this market information helps identify the top competitors by line of business or specialty program and also identifies our market strengths and weaknesses 
the analysis encompasses pricing  breadth of coverage and underwriting eligibility issues 
in addition to reviewing our competitive position  our product management group and our underwriting audit group review compliance with our underwriting standards as well as the pricing adequacy of our commercial insurance programs and coverages 
further  our research and development group analyzes opportunities and develops new products  new coverage options and improvements to existing insurance products

the e clas platform also makes use of our real time agency interface  cincibridge  which allows the automated movement of key underwriting data from an agency s management system to e clas
