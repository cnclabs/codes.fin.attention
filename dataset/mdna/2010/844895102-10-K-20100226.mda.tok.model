item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk  including commodity price risk  weather risk  and interest rate risk 
the following describes the company s exposure to these risks 
commodity price risk in managing its natural gas supply portfolios  southwest has historically entered into short duration one year or less fixed price contracts and variable price contracts firm and spot 
southwest has experienced significant price volatility over the past several years 
price volatility is expected to continue into and beyond 
southwest is protected financially from commodity price risk by purchased gas adjustment pga mechanisms in each of its jurisdictions 
these mechanisms generally allow southwest to defer over or under collections of gas costs to pga balancing accounts 
with regulatory approval  southwest can either refund amounts over collected or recoup amounts under collected in future periods 
in addition to the pga mechanism  southwest utilizes a volatility mitigation program to attempt to further reduce price volatility for customers 
under this program southwest fixes the price of approximately percent of its natural gas portfolio using fixed price contracts and or derivative instruments fixed for floating swaps 
all of southwest s natural gas purchase practices are subject to prudence review by the various regulatory bodies in each jurisdiction 
pga changes affect cash flows and potentially short term borrowing requirements  but do not directly impact profit margin 

table of contents weather risk a significant portion of the company s operating margin is volume driven with current rates based on an assumption of normal weather 
demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature 
on cold days  use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be six times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating 
space heating related volumes are the primary component of billings for these customer classes and are concentrated in the months of november to march 
variances in temperatures from normal levels  especially during these months  have a significant impact on the margin and associated net income of the company 
this impact is most pronounced in arizona  where percent of southwest s customers are located and where rates are highly leveraged 
rate design is the primary mechanism available to southwest to mitigate weather risk 
in california  cpuc regulations allow southwest to decouple operating margin from usage and offset weather risk 
in nevada  southwest was authorized in november to implement a decoupled rate structure that will help stabilize operating margin by insulating the company from the effects of lower usage including volumes associated with unusual weather 
in arizona  the basic service charge provides some protection against weather risk but commodity rates are highly leveraged  leaving a significant portion of operating margin subject to weather variations 
the company continues to pursue a mechanism in arizona to stabilize the recovery of the company s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than normal weather 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings or cash flows 
the primary interest rate risk for the company is the risk of increasing interest rates on variable rate obligations 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates 
in nevada  fluctuations in interest rates on million of variable rate industrial development revenue bonds idrbs are tracked and recovered from ratepayers through an interest balancing account which mitigates risk to earnings and cash flows from interest rate fluctuations on these idrbs between general rate cases 
as of december  and  southwest had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt outstanding  excluding the idrbs noted above 
assuming a constant outstanding balance in variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund maturities of long term debt 
southwest has million of long term debt maturing in february and million maturing in may the company currently intends to issue million of new debentures in december and million of debentures in march to provide funding for the maturing obligations and a portion of the redeemed subordinated debentures 
in connection with these planned debt issuances  the company  in january  entered into two forward starting interest rate swap fsirs agreements to hedge the risk of interest rate variability during the period leading up to the planned issuances 
the counterparties to both agreements comprise four major banking institutions 
the first fsirs has a notional amount of million with southwest as the fixed rate payer at a rate of and has a mandatory termination date on or before december  the second fsirs has a notional amount of million with southwest as the fixed rate payer at a rate of and has a mandatory termination date on or before march  southwest has designated the fsirs agreements as cash flow hedges of forecasted future interest payments
