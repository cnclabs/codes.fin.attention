item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the subheading gross margin  which is incorporated herein by reference 
the company and other participants in the personal computer  and mobile communication and media device industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries 
the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source 
when a component or product uses new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased 
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices  or at all  may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key single sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained  if such components were available only at significantly higher prices  or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the us substantially all of the company s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third party manufacturers 
many of these manufacturers are located outside of the us  and are concentrated in several general locations 
the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while these arrangements may lower operating costs  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of 
table of contents products or services  or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
in addition  the company relies on third party manufacturers to adhere to the company s supplier code of conduct 
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could materially adversely affect the company s reputation  financial condition and operating results 
final assembly of the company s products is currently performed in the company s manufacturing facility in ireland  and by external vendors in california  texas  china  the czech republic and korea 
currently  the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole sourced third party vendors in the us  china  germany  ireland  israel  japan  korea  malaysia  the netherlands  the philippines  taiwan  thailand and singapore 
sole sourced third party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the company s mac products  iphones  ipads and ipods 
if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason  including but not limited to  natural disasters  information technology system failures  military actions or economic  business  labor  environmental  public health  or political issues  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies on third party digital content  which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the company s itunes store 
the company s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms  if at all 
some third party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services  and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future 
other content owners  providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to  or increase the total cost of  such content 
if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules  or continue to expand its geographic reach  the company s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
many third party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management drm and other security solutions 
if these requirements change  the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions 
there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner 
in addition  certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm  which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company s content providers 
the company relies on access to third party patents and intellectual property  and the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights 
many of the company s products are designed to include third party intellectual property  and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods 
although the company believes that  based on past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms  there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid issuance of new patents  it is possible that certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
from time to time  the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights 
regardless of merit  responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense 
at present  the company is vigorously defending a number of patent infringement cases  and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation 
in certain cases  the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements  although no 
table of contents assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
if the company is found to be infringing such rights  it may be required to pay substantial damages 
if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected  regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology 
while in management s opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results  the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
with the introduction of iphones and g enabled ipads  the company has begun to compete with mobile communication and media devices companies that hold significant patent portfolios 
regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors  the company may have to engage in protracted litigation  enter into expensive agreements or settlements and or modify its products 
any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s future performance depends on support from third party software developers 
if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products  customers may choose not to buy the company s products 
the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products  including its macs  iphones  ipads and ipods  are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third party software applications and services 
there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company s products on a timely basis or at all  and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
with respect to its mac products  the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products 
this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated revenue that may be generated  continued acceptance by customers of mac os x  and the costs of developing such applications and services 
if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company s prospects  developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
the company s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third party developers  such as microsoft  adobe and google  to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the company s products 
with respect to iphone  ipad and ipod touch  the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications 
unlike third party software applications for mac products  the software applications for the iphone  ipad and ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel  the app store 
the absence of multiple distribution channels  which are available for competing platforms  may limit the availability and acceptance of third party applications by the company s customers  thereby causing developers to curtail significantly  or stop  development for the company s platforms 
in addition  iphone  ipad and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change  and  if third party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change  third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers 
further  if the company develops its own software applications and services  such development may negatively affect the decisions of third party developers to develop  maintain  
table of contents and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iphone  ipad and ipod touch platforms 
as with applications for the company s mac products  the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company s products rather than its competitors products  including devices that use competing platforms 
if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms  the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer 
the company s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors  carriers and other resellers 
the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers  value added resellers  and cataloguers  many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company also sells many of its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to customers  certain education customers  cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain resellers through its online and retail stores 
many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions 
some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products 
such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products 
the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens  if resellers stopped distributing the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales  including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays 
these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue 
the company s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
the company s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  information systems  inventory and personnel 
the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space  with terms ranging from five to years  the majority of which are for ten years 
certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities 
because of their unique design elements  locations and size  these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores 
due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment  a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs  write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements  and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
many factors unique to retail operations  some of which are beyond the company s control  pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  macro economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity  as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation  inability to sell third party products at adequate margins  failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners  more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the us  costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory  and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

table of contents investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 
the company has invested  and in the future may invest  in new business strategies or acquisitions 
such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management from current operations  insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy  inadequate return of capital  and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence 
because these new ventures are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 
the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture 
sophisticated operating system software and applications  such as those sold by the company  often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation 
defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware  software and services it sells 
failure to do so could result in lost revenue  harm to reputation  and significant warranty and other expenses  and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
in the us the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone 
in the us the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis 
if this exclusive carrier cannot successfully compete with other carriers in the us market on any basis  including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services  performance and timely build out of advanced wireless networks  and pricing and other terms or conditions of customer contracts  or if this exclusive carrier fails to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans  sales may be materially adversely affected 
the company is subject to risks associated with laws  regulations and industry imposed standards related to mobile communications and media devices 
laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change 
such changes  which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production  manufacture  distribution  and use of the device  locking the device to a carrier s network  or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier s network  could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
mobile communication and media devices  such as iphones and g enabled ipads  are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies  as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks 
these certification processes are extensive and time consuming  and could result in additional testing requirements  product modifications or delays in product shipment dates  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 
much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel  including its ceo  its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where most of the company s key personnel are located 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to attract and retain key personnel 

table of contents political events  war  terrorism  public health issues  natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company 
war  terrorism  geopolitical uncertainties  public health issues  and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy  and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company  its suppliers  logistics providers  manufacturing vendors and customers  including channel partners 
the company s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks  and other hostile acts  labor disputes  public health issues  and other events beyond its control 
such events could decrease demand for the company s products  make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers  including channel partners  or to receive components from its suppliers  and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain 
should major public health issues  including pandemics  arise  the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  information technology systems  and other critical business operations  including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors  are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters 
in the event of a natural disaster  losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company may be subject to information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors  including but not limited to  earthquakes  fire  theft  fraud  malicious attack or other causes could disrupt the company s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer  including channel partner  orders  negatively affecting the company s online  itunes  mobileme and retail offerings and services  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing transactions and reporting financial results  resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information  or damage to the company s reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels 
the company s software  accessories  and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products 
gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions  pricing and configuration changes  and component  warranty  and other cost fluctuations 
the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners 
in addition  the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages  as well as overall profitability  may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product  geographic or channel mix  new products  component cost increases  strengthening us dollar  or price competition 
the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year  respectively 
furthermore  the company sells more products from time to time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  issues with new product introductions  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics  components supply  or manufacturing partners  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the company s stock price continues to be volatile 
the company s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors  including but not limited to variations between its actual and anticipated financial results  announcements by the company and its competitors  and uncertainty about current global economic conditions 
the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
furthermore  the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations 
if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline  which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations 
compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the company s international operations  including without limitation import and export requirements  anti corruption laws  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions  data privacy requirements  labor laws  and anti competition regulations  increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions  and any such costs  which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation 
furthermore  the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  but there can be no assurance that the company s employees  contractors  or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies 
any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities  including but not limited to  economic and labor conditions  increased duties  taxes and other costs  political instability  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 
margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including duties  tariffs and antidumping penalties 
additionally  the company is exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets 
there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non us dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada and certain parts of asia  as well as non us dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing  potentially reducing demand for the company s products 
in some circumstances  due to competition or other reasons  the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar s strengthening  or at all  which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
conversely  a strengthening of foreign currencies  while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments  thereby limiting the benefit 
additionally  strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies  thus adversely affecting gross margins 
the company has used derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward and option contracts  to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

table of contents the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 
although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
given the global nature of its business  the company has investments both domestically and internationally 
credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity  credit deterioration or losses  financial results  or other factors 
as a result  the value or liquidity of the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable  vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers  wholesalers  retailers and value added resellers 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables are increased in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited 
cellular network carriers accounted for a significant potion of the company s trade receivables as of september  the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the company s non trade receivables as of september  in addition  the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components 
while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments  there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the matters relating to the company s past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation 
the company s investigation into its past stock option practices and its restatement of prior financial statements in the annual report on form k for the year ended september  gave rise to litigation and government investigations 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings  several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the company and current and former officers and directors 
these actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement 
two former officers of the company were also named as defendants in an sec enforcement action  which has been settled 
no assurance can be given that additional actions will not be filed against the company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices 
if such actions are filed and result in adverse findings  the remedies could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future 
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
regardless of merit  litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to the company s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention 
in recognition of these considerations  the company may enter into material settlements 
should the company fail to prevail in certain matters  or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health  safety and environmental protection 
the company s products and services  and the production and distribution of those goods and services  are subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
these may require the company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates  including various countries within europe and asia and certain states and provinces within north america 
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the focus of such laws  there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
changes in the company s tax rates  the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results 
the company is subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the company s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that  if adopted  could adversely affect the company s tax rate 
any of these changes could have a material adverse affect on the company s profitability 
the company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance 
for certain risks  the company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and or availability 
because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks  and in some cases self insures completely  unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results

item legal proceedings as of september   the end of the annual period covered by this report  the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below  as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  valuation and impairment of marketable securities  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  digital content and applications  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products eg  macs  iphones  ipads  ipods and peripherals  software bundled with hardware that is 
table of contents essential to the functionality of the hardware  and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products  ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
for multi element arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product s essential software  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
for all past and current sales of iphone  ipad  apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june  the company indicated it might from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers 
the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices 
the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale 
the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone  ipad  ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when and if available basis  future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product s essential software 
the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables  the allocation of revenue has been based on the company s esps 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the month estimated life of each of these devices 
all product cost of sales  including estimated warranty costs  are recognized at the time of sale 
costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred 
if the estimated life of the hardware product should change  the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change 
the company s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves management s judgment 
the company s process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
the company believes its customers  particularly consumers  would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone  ipad  ipod touch and apple tv 
this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all  and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered 
therefore  the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis  including those rights associated with iphone  ipad  ipod touch and apple tv  the selling price would be relatively low 
key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings  the company s historical pricing practices  the nature of the upgrade rights eg  unspecified and when and if available  and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product 
the company may also consider  when appropriate  the impact of other products and services  including advertising services  on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables 
the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate  including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist  and product specific business objectives 
if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors  the company s esp for software upgrades related to future sales for these devices could change 

table of contents beginning in the third quarter of in conjunction with the announcement of ios  the company s esps for the embedded software upgrade rights included with iphone  ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding software that includes or supports an advertising component 
ios supports iad  the company s new mobile advertising platform  which enables applications on iphone  ipad and ipod touch to feature media rich advertisements within applications 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s policy requires that  if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for customer incentive programs  the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  as reported in the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of investments impact the company s net income only when such investments are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  the company evaluates  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and the company s intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell  the investment before recovery of the investment s amortized cost basis 
the company s assessment on whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired or not  could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs  which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded 

table of contents the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software s compliance with specifications 
the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized 
factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered  the number of updates expected to occur  and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with gaap  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in note commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with gaap  the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in management s opinion  the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results 
however  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

retail net sales decreased million or during compared to the decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iphones  ipods and mac desktop systems  offset partially by strong demand for mac portable systems 
the year over year decline in retail net sales was attributable to continued third party channel expansion  particularly in the us where most of the company s stores are located  and also reflects the challenging consumer spending environment in the company opened new retail stores during  including international stores  ending the year with stores open 
this compares to stores open as of september  with an average of stores and stores opened during and  respectively  average revenue per store decreased to million for from million in the retail segment reported operating income of billion during and billion during both and the increase in retail operating income during compared to was attributable to higher overall net sales 
despite the decline in retail net sales during compared to  the retail segment s operating income was flat at billion in compared to due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage in consistent with that experienced by the overall company 
expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure  operating lease commitments  personnel  and other operating expenses

the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents gross margin gross margin for the three years ended september   are as follows in millions  except gross margin percentages net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin percentage the gross margin percentage in was compared to in this decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to new products that have higher cost structures  including ipad  partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone  which has a higher gross margin than the company average 
the gross margin percentage in was compared to in the primary contributors to the increase in as compared to were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity and other product costs  which were partially offset by product price reductions 
the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during and anticipates gross margin levels of about in the first quarter of this expected decline is largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers  and expected and potential future component cost and other cost increases 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage are forward looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors  including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i  item a  risk factors under the subheading future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors  nand flash memory  dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities  which is incorporated herein by reference 
there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  product transitions and expected and potential increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors  nand flash memory  dram and lcds  as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins 
in response to these competitive pressures  the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions  which would adversely affect gross margins 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
due to the company s significant international operations  financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three years ended september   are as follows in millions  except for percentages research and development percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales 
table of contents research and development expense r d r d expense increased or million to billion in compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r d activities 
also contributing to this increase in r d expense in was the capitalization in of software development costs of million related to mac os x snow leopard 
although total r d expense increased during  it declined as a percentage of net sales given the year over year increase in net sales in the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
as such  the company expects to make further investments in r d to remain competitive 
r d expense increased or million to billion in compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in to support expanded r d activities and higher stock based compensation expenses 
additionally  million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r d expense during  compared to million of software development costs capitalized during although total r d expense increased during  it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the increase in revenue in selling  general and administrative expense sg a sg a expense increased billion or to billion in compared to this increase was due primarily to the company s continued expansion of its retail segment  higher spending on marketing and advertising programs  increased stock based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company s net sales

the company s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of due 
table of contents primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us the lower effective tax rate in as compared to is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which us income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us as of september   the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of billion  and deferred tax liabilities of billion 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance

however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september  in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable  net inventories working capital annual operating cash flow as of september   the company had billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of billion from september  the principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of billion  which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property  plant and equipment of billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million 
the company s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities  generally with a minimum rating of single a or equivalent 
as of september  and september   billion and billion  respectively  of the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollar denominated holdings 
the company believes its existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs  capital asset purchases  outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next months 

table of contents capital assets the company s capital expenditures were billion during  consisting of approximately million for retail store facilities and billion for other capital expenditures  including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and corporate facilities and infrastructure 
the company s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during were billion 
the company anticipates utilizing approximately billion for capital expenditures during  including approximately million for retail store facilities and approximately billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  and corporate facilities and infrastructure  including information systems hardware  software and enhancements 
historically the company has opened between and new retail stores per year 
during  the company expects to open to new stores  over half of which are expected to be located outside of the us off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company 
the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september  and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in millions total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due in more than years operating leases purchase obligations other obligations total lease commitments as of september   the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of billion  billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities 
the company s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years 
leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to years  the majority of which are for ten years  and often contain multi year renewal options 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods ranging from to days 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 

table of contents such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
as of september   the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of billion 
the company has entered into prepaid long term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components  which generally expire between and in august  the company entered into a long term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay million in these prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement 
other obligations other outstanding obligations were billion as of september   which related to advertising  research and development  product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  internet and telecommunications services and other obligations 
the company s other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities  gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties 
as of september   the company had non current deferred tax liabilities of billion 
additionally  as of september   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and an additional million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
indemnifications the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party and  in the opinion of management  does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results 
therefore  the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september  or september  the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers 
under these agreements  the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim 
however  the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations  and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company s financial condition or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from 
table of contents movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the fair value of those investments  as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade  primarily rated single a or better  with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents 
the company classifies its marketable securities as either short term or long term based on each instrument s underlying contractual maturity date 
all short term marketable securities have maturities less than months  while all long term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years 
the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes  in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for duration management 
the company recognized no significant net gains or losses during  and related to such sales 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures  typically for three to six months 

table of contents however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to immateriality  accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions
