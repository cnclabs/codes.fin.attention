overview fsp corp  or the company  operates in two business segments real estate operations and investment banking investment services 
the real estate operations segment involves real estate rental operations  leasing  secured financing of real estate for interim acquisition or other property financing  and services provided for asset management  property management  property acquisitions  dispositions and development 
the investment banking investment services segment involves the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that include the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in private placements 
the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states 
these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level 
we have no influence on the national market conditions 
we look to acquire and or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur 
our investment banking investment services customers are primarily institutions and high net worth individuals 
to the extent that the broad capital markets affect these investors our business is also affected 
these investors have many investment choices 
we must continually search for real estate at a price and at a competitive risk reward rate of return that meets our customer s risk reward profile for providing a stream of income and as a long term hedge against inflation 
as of december   we have an automatic shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of our common stock 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock under our automatic shelf registration statement or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties  to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes 
trends and uncertainties economic conditions the economy in the united states is continuing to experience significant disruptions  including increased levels of unemployment  the failure and near failure of a number of large financial institutions  reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for a number of market participants 
economic conditions may be affected by numerous factors including but not limited to  inflation and employment levels  energy prices  recessionary concerns  changes in currency exchange rates  the availability of debt and interest rate fluctuations 
the current disruptions in the us economy have affected our business  resulting in a decline in occupancy in our real estate portfolio in  and may affect real estate values  occupancy levels  property income and the propensity and the ability of investors to invest in our sponsored reits in the future 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent or duration of any negative impact that the current disruptions in the us economy will have on our business 
on july   we announced that we had reduced our regular quarterly dividend to per share of common stock for the three months ended june   which was paid on august  in our july  announcement  we noted that we had experienced a significant slowing of activity in  and lower profit contribution from  two transactional components of our business  investment banking investment services and property dispositions  since the onset of the current disruptions in the us economy 
we also noted that our ongoing recurring real estate operations continued to show solid performance and that our board of directors believed it was prudent to better align our regular quarterly dividends with the results of our current real estate operations only  without taking into account the results of our less predictable transactional operations 
since the third quarter of  we have continued to experience a significant slowing of activity in  and lower profit contribution from  two transactional components of our business  investment banking investment services and property dispositions 
however  since the third quarter of  we have announced a dividend of per share of common stock for each quarterly period 
real estate operations our real estate portfolio was approximately leased as of december  and approximately leased as of december  new leasing activity remains slow in most of our markets and we do not expect to see an increase in the pace of leasing until the broader economic markets stabilize and there is new job growth 
approximately of the square footage in our portfolio is scheduled to expire during and approximately is scheduled to expire during while we cannot predict when existing vacancy will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be  we expect to renew or sign new leases at current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located  which in many cases may be below the expiring rates 
as the economic downturn continues  we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws has increased 
if any of our tenants defaults on its lease  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
in addition  at any time  a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
investment banking investment services unlike our real estate operations business  which provides a rental revenue stream which is ongoing and recurring in nature  our investment banking investment services business is transactional in nature 
equity raised for sponsored reit syndications for decreased to million compared to million in in august  one of our sponsored reits  fsp grand boulevard corp  purchased an office property located in kansas city  missouri 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement preferred stock offering totaling million  and was fully subscribed in the second quarter of we purchased a total of shares of preferred stock in the sponsored reit at a net cost of approximately million 
the balance of the offering was subscribed for primarily by institutions and high net worth individuals  our traditional customer base 
in may  one of our sponsored reits  fsp interlocken development corp  began development of an office property located in broomfield  colorado 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement offering of preferred stock totaling million  million of which had been closed in as of december  this private placement offering is ongoing as of the beginning of in december  one of our sponsored reits  fsp lakeside crossing ii corp  purchased an office property located in maryland heights  missouri 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement stock offering totaling million  and was fully subscribed in the fourth quarter of also in december  one of our sponsored reits  fsp centre pointe v corp  purchased an office property located in west chester  ohio 
permanent equity capitalization of the property was structured as a private placement preferred stock offering totaling million  of which had been raised as of december  this private placement offering is ongoing as of the beginning of the slowdown in our investment banking business actually began in the third quarter of and  at this point  it remains unclear when or if a higher volume of equity investment will return 
business in this area  while always uncertain  continues to be adversely affected by the current turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets 
investors who have historically participated in our private placement real estate offerings continue to express concern and uncertainty about investing in this environment 
recently  however  some investors have expressed cautious interest in investing some portion of their capital in specific property situations as evidenced by the investments in fsp lakeside crossing ii corp 
and fsp centre pointe v corp 
described above 
in addition to difficulties in raising equity from potential real estate investors in this market  our property acquisition executives are now grappling with greater uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for prime commercial investment real estate 
we believe that the current turmoil in the debt markets  as well as perceptions about the future us economy and interest rates  are producing a larger than normal divergence in the perception of value and future relative investment performance of commercial properties 
while we generally believe that such an environment has the potential to produce some exceptional property acquisition opportunities  caution  perspective and disciplined underwriting standards can significantly impact the timing of any future acquisitions 
consequently  our ability to provide a regular stream of real estate investment product necessary to grow our overall investment banking investment services business continues to remain uncertain as begins 
we also continue to rely solely on our in house investment executives to access interested investors who have capital they can afford to place in an illiquid position for an indefinite period of time ie  invest in a sponsored reit 
we continue to evaluate whether our in house sales force is capable  either through our existing client base or through new clients  of raising sufficient investment capital in sponsored reits to achieve future performance objectives 
discontinued operations and property dispositions during the years ended december  and  we sold no properties 
however  we recognized a gain of approximately  on a small piece of land as a result of a land taking by the commonwealth of virginia in during the year ended december   we disposed of five office properties 
the five office properties are located in greenville  south carolina  alpharetta  georgia  san diego  california  westford  massachusetts and austin  texas 
accordingly  sold properties as of december  are classified as held for sale on our financial statements 
the operating results for these real estate assets have been reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the year ended december  we continue to evaluate our portfolio  and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
however  because of the current uncertainty surrounding the valuation levels for real estate and the current uncertainty in the capital and debt markets previously discussed  we do not expect the level of disposition activity to be as significant as it was in critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations  and that require significant management estimates and judgments  are discussed below 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  purchase price allocations  useful lives of fixed assets and the valuation of the derivative 
critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in sponsored reits and our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase prices  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets  useful lives of fixed assets  valuation of derivatives  classification of leases  and revenue recognition in the syndication of sponsored reits 
allocation of purchase price we have historically allocated the purchase prices of properties to land  buildings and improvements 
each component of purchase price generally has a different useful life 
for properties acquired subsequent to june   we allocate the value of real estate acquired among land  buildings  improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of tenant relationships 
purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates 
under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations 
purchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant 
management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
purchase price allocated to above market leases is based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
purchase price allocated to in place leases and tenant relationships is determined as the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include i an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  including real estate taxes  insurance and other operating income and expenses  and ii costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
if future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
allowance for bad debts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of a tenant s ability to make future rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based in part on the tenants payment history and current credit status 
impairment we periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include declining tenant occupancy  weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative  economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
depreciation expense we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
costs incurred in connection with leasing primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the lease period 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
the value of above or below market leases is amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income 
the value of in place leases  exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases  is also amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs  or incorrect estimates of useful lives  could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods  as is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
derivative instruments we recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify  or are not designated as hedge relationships  must be adjusted to fair value through income 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
to the extent hedges are effective  a corresponding amount  adjusted for swap payments  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in the income statement 
we periodically review the effectiveness of each hedging transaction  which involves estimating future cash flows  at least quarterly 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
we currently have no fair value hedges outstanding 
fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates 
the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets  derivative liabilities  book equity  and or earnings 
lease classification some of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
revenue recognition we earn syndication and transaction fees in connection with the syndication of sponsored reits 
we recognize syndication fees related to commissions when shares of the sponsored reit are sold and the investor s funds have been transferred from escrow into our account 
we recognize transaction fees related to loan commitment and acquisition fees upon an investor closing and the subsequent payment of the sponsored reit s loan and fees payable to us 
other transaction fees are recognized upon the final closing of the syndication of the sponsored reit 
ownership of stock in a sponsored reit common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by the company 
following the commencement of syndication the company exercises influence over  but does not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
once under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses or dividends received from sponsored reits generally are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there is an asset held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we recognize our share of the operations during the period we consolidate and when the equity method is appropriate  as opposed to classifying the sponsored reits as discontinued operations  because we earn an ongoing asset and or property management fee from sponsored reits 
these ongoing fees  in addition to the influence that we exercise over the sponsored reit  constitute a continuing involvement between the company and the sponsored reit and preclude treatment as discontinued operations 
we currently hold preferred stock interest in three sponsored reits 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in these three sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares i with respect to any merger in the same manner that a majority of the other stockholders of the sponsored reit vote for or against the merger and ii with respect to any other matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of that sponsored reit 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us  current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located 
competition  economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future 
in the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
recent accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a pronouncement establishing the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the standard explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after september  the company has adopted this standard in accordance with gaap 
in september  the fasb issued a pronouncement that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and provides for expanded disclosure about fair value measurements that will be applied prospectively  to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the pronouncement excludes certain leasing transactions accounted for in accounting for leases and was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flow 
the fasb then issued a pronouncement to defer the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a pronouncement  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the pronouncement was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued a pronouncement which sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this pronouncement requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this disclosure should alert all users of financials statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
the company is adhering to the requirements of this pronouncement  which was effective for financial periods ending after june  on june   the fasb issued a pronouncement that changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations overview during we acquired one property  made an million investment in a sponsored reit and sold five properties 
during  we acquired one property by merger and two additional properties by direct acquisition 
during  we acquired three properties  made a million investment in a sponsored reit and completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock including million shares issued as a result of the full exercise of an overallotment option by the underwriter at a price to the public of per share 
as a result of this activity  as of december   we owned properties and had investments in three non consolidated reits 
mergers and acquisitions on june   we acquired a commercial property in maryland 
on may   we completed the acquisition by merger of park ten development  on december  we acquired a commercial property in missouri and on december  we acquired a commercial property in virginia 
on june   we acquired a commercial property in virginia  on june  we acquired a commercial property in minnesota and on september  we acquired another commercial property in virginia 
the results of operations for each of the acquired properties are included in our operating results as of their respective merger or purchase dates 
increases in rental revenues and expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   or the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are primarily a result of the timing of these acquisitions and subsequent contribution of these acquired properties 
sales of real estate on january   we sold a commercial property  located in greenville  south carolina  on june   we sold an office property in alpharetta  georgia  on june  we sold an office property in san diego  california  on july  we sold an office property in westford  massachusetts  and on december  we sold an office property in austin  texas 
we had no sales of real estate in or however  we recognized a gain of approximately  on a small piece of land as a result of a land taking by the commonwealth of virginia in the operating results of the properties sold in are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
investment banking revenue for the investment banking investment services segment is primarily based on the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in the syndications of the sponsored reits 
during  we completed one syndication of a sponsored reit and began the process of syndicating another sponsored reit which we completed in may   for which total gross proceeds aggregated million in during  we started syndication of another sponsored reit 
total gross proceeds from both syndications aggregated million in and one remains currently in process 
during  we completed the syndication of two sponsored reits and began the process of syndicating another sponsored reit  for which total gross proceeds aggregated million in we believe the decrease of million in compared to and the decrease of million in compared to were attributable to the recent turmoil in the financial  debt and real estate markets  which is discussed above in trends and uncertainties economic conditions 
revenues and expenses for investment banking investment services are directly related to the gross proceeds of these syndications 
our acquisition executives continue to work on other property investment opportunities for our own portfolio and for syndication 
however  business growth in the syndication area remains uncertain at the beginning of the following table shows financial results for the years ended december  and in thousands revenues change rental related party revenue syndication fees transaction fees management fees and interest income from loans other total revenues expenses real estate operating expenses real estate taxes and insurance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative commissions interest total expenses income before interest income  equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits and taxes on income interest income equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits income before taxes on income taxes on income income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of properties  less applicable income tax total discontinued operations net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o an increase to rental revenue of approximately million arising primarily from the acquisition of a property in texas in may  the acquisition of two properties located in virginia and missouri in december  the acquisition of two properties located in virginia and minnesota in june  the acquisition of another property in virginia in september and early termination fees of million received during the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by o a million decrease in syndication fees and transaction fees  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the same period in expenses total expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o an increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization of million  which were primarily from the acquisition of a property in texas in may  the acquisition of two properties located in virginia and missouri in december  the acquisition of two properties located in virginia and minnesota that were acquired in june and the acquisition of another property in virginia in september o an increase in interest expense of approximately million primarily as a result of the addition of the term loan  which was borrowed in october  and was partially offset by lower average interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  o an increase in general and administrative expenses of million  which was primarily the result acquisition costs of  that were recorded in during the year ended december  related to the acquisition of two properties in june and the acquisition of a property in september we had and employees as of december  and  respectively  at our headquarters in wakefield 
these increases were partially offset by o a decrease in commission expense of  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds in the year ended december  compared to the same period in interest income interest income decreased million to million during the year ended december   which was primarily a result of lower average interest rates on invested funds and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents in compared to the same period in equity in earnings of non consolidated reits equity in earnings from non consolidated reits decreased approximately million to million  which was principally a result of our preferred stock investment in east wacker during the year ended december  compared to the same period of taxes on income taxes on income decreased approximately million to a tax benefit of million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of the decrease was primarily due to a lower taxable income from the investment banking and investment services business in the period compared to income from continuing operations the resulting income from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreased million to million for the reasons described above

the impact of this decrease was slightly greater as a result of lower interest rates charged during compared to these decreases were partially offset by o an increase to rental revenue of approximately million from real estate arising primarily from the acquisitions of the following properties a property in maryland in june  a property in texas in may  a property in missouri in december and a property in virginia in december expenses total expenses were million for the year ended december   or an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o the increase in real estate operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance costs of million  and depreciation of million  which were primarily a result of the acquisitions discussed above 
o an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   which was primarily a result of the cost of new employees hired in  and increases in discretionary bonuses and professional fees 
we had and employees as of december  and at our headquarters in wakefield 
these increases were partially offset by o a decrease in interest expense of million resulting primarily from a lower average loan balance outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and to a lesser extent lower interest rates in compared to o a decrease in commission expenses of million  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december interest income interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily a result of a lower interest rates and a lower average balance of cash between and equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits equity in earnings losses of non consolidated reits increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million for the year ended december   which was principally a result of income attributed to us from our investment in east wacker 
taxes on income taxes on income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income from the investment banking and investment services business in the period compared to  which was principally a result of the decrease in gross syndication proceeds from compared to income from continuing operations the resulting income from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreased million to million for the reasons discussed above 
discontinued operations and gain on sale of assets during  we did not sell any properties 
during  we sold five properties which are reported as discontinued operations on our financial statements for the year ended december  income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december during the year ended december   we reported million as gain on sale of assets  which is summarized in the table below in thousands net city property date of sales property address state type sale proceeds gain villa road greenville  sc office january  great oaks way alpharetta  ga office june  goldentop road san diego  ca office june  lyberty way westford  ma office july  taylor draper lane austin  tx office december  settlement of escrows on prior property sales net sales proceeds and gain on sales of real estate net income the resulting net income for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
this decrease of million is attributable to million provided by operating activities less million used by investing activities plus million provided by financing activities 
management believes that existing cash  cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations  cash anticipated to be generated by the sale of preferred stock in future sponsored reits and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth  we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations and from fees and commissions from the sale of shares in newly formed sponsored reits 
we believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements  in addition to normal operating expenses 
our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders  however  depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties and the level of interest on the part of investors in purchasing shares of sponsored reits

off balance sheet arrangements investments in sponsored reits as part of our business model we organize single purpose entities that own real estate  purchases of which are financed through the private placement of equity in those entities  typically through syndication 
we call these entities sponsored reits  and they are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts 
we earn fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the sponsored reits in these syndications 
the sponsored reits issue both common stock and preferred stock 
the common stock is owned by fsp corp 
generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors  however  we acquired an interest in preferred shares of five sponsored reits 
in addition  directors and officers of fsp corp  have from time to time invested in sponsored reits and may do so again in the future 
following consummation of the offerings  the preferred stockholders in each of the sponsored reits are entitled to of the sponsored reit s cash distributions 
subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  except for the preferred stock we own  we do not share in any of the sponsored reit s earnings  or any related dividend  and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk 
prior to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  we share in a sponsored reit s earnings and related dividends to the extent of our ownership interest in the sponsored reit 
as a common stockholder  upon completion of the syndication  we have no rights to the sponsored reit s earnings or any related cash distributions

common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by us 
following the commencement of syndication we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  the cost basis is increased by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative and distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there are assets held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in five sponsored reits  including one we acquired on may  by cash merger and another we acquired on april  by merger 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in the remaining three sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december  and  if market rates on borrowings under our revolver increased by at maturity  or approximately and basis points  respectively  over the current variable rate  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million annually 
the interest rate on our revolver as of december  was libor plus basis points 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by borrowings under our revolver is material as of december  our term loan of million bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus basis points  with a floor on libor  which was fixed at per annum for its initial three year term with an interest rate swap agreement  and therefore  the fair value of this instrument is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that we have mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the term loan through the interest rate swap agreement for the initial three year term of the loan 
this interest rate swap agreement was our only derivative instrument as of december  and the term loan has an initial three year term that matures on october  in addition  we have the right to extend the initial maturity date for up to two successive one year periods  or until october  if both extensions are exercised 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
the table below lists our derivative instrument  which is hedging variable cash flows related to interest on our term loan as of december  in thousands in s asset hedged benchmark rate notional value strike rate effective date expiration date fair value interest rate swap term loan libor our term loan hedging transaction used a derivative instrument that involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparty to our derivative arrangement is rbs citizens  na  which has a senior unsecured debt credit rating of a by moody s 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the counterparty will fail to meet its obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
the revolver matures in august and has a variable rate of interest 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
we borrow from time to time under the revolver 
these borrowings bear interest at the bank s base rate at december  or a day libor plus basis points at december   as elected by us when requesting funds 
generally the borrowings are for day libor plus basis points 
there were borrowings totaling  and  in the aggregate at the day libor plus basis point rate  representing a weighted average rate of and outstanding under the revolver at december  and  respectively 
we have drawn on the revolver  and intend to draw on the revolver in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the funding of acquisition loans and sponsored reit loans
