employees as of december   we had approximately full time and part time employees 
we hire temporary employees and use volunteers to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe we enjoy a good relationship with our employees 
insurance we maintain property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with insurers we believe to be financially sound 
our insurance policies generally cover accidents that may occur at our speedways  subject to ordinary course deductibles  policy limits and exceptions 
as further described below in risk factors  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties  and motorsports events and other business risks 
we believe our insurance levels are sufficient for our needs and consistent with insurance maintained by similar companies

environmental matters solid waste landfilling has occurred on and around cms s property for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the cms property ceased in however  there is one landfill at cms currently being permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities lcid landfill  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the cms property were closed in cms intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the cms property in the future 
prior to  cms leased a portion of our property to allied waste industries  inc allied for use as a construction and demolition debris landfill a c d landfill  which received solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but could not receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
the cms c d landfill is now closed 
in addition  allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to cms 
we believe the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management believes that our operations  including the landfills on our property  comply with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
portions of the inactive solid waste landfill areas on the cms property are subject to a groundwater monitoring program and data are submitted to the north carolina department of environment and natural resources denr 
denr has noted that data from certain groundwater sampling events have indicated levels of certain regulated compounds that exceed acceptable trigger levels and organic compounds that exceed regulatory groundwater standards 
denr has not required any remedial action by us at this time with respect to this situation 
in the future  denr could require us to take certain actions that could result in us incurring material costs

risk factors set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that  if they were to occur  could materially adversely affect our business or cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements contained in this report or other public statements we may make 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business 
shareholders and prospective investors should carefully consider and evaluate all of the risk factors described below 
however  many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or foresee  and undue reliance should not be put on forward looking statements 
risk and other forward looking factors may or may not ultimately be found correct 
these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended  supplemented  or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in future periodic reports on form q  form k or other forms we file with the sec 
the united states and global economic slowdown and ongoing disruptions in the financial markets could have a significant adverse impact on consumer and corporate spending and our business in ways that we cannot currently predict 
consumer and corporate spending can significantly impact our operating results  and national or local catastrophes  elevated terrorism alerts or natural disasters could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending 
the recent combination of severely tightened credit markets  stringent and costly borrowing conditions  deterioration of residential real estate and mortgage markets  unprecedented stock market declines and fluctuating oil and commodity prices  among other factors  have led to historically low levels of consumer confidence and recessionary conditions 
the direction and strength of the united states economy  including the financial and credit markets  currently is uncertain due to these factors 
many of these conditions and uncertainties also exist in varying degrees throughout the global markets 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents many factors related to discretionary consumer spending can adversely impact recreational and entertainment spending and significantly impact our operating results 
consumer disposable income and spending are affected by economic conditions such as employment rates  high or rising fuel prices  difficult consumer credit and housing markets  interest and tax rates and inflation 
many factors affect corporate spending such as general economic and other business conditions  including consumer spending  high or rising fuel prices  interest and tax rates  hurricanes  flooding  earthquakes and other natural disasters  elevated terrorism alerts  terrorist attacks  military actions and inflation  as well as various industry and other business conditions  including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels 
such factors or incidents  even if not directly impacting us  could disrupt or otherwise adversely impact our customers  markets and consumer spending in general 
also  recent or future governmental actions may control  influence or otherwise restrict corporate spending or spending trends 
these factors can impact regional and national consumer and corporate spending sentiment  and adversely affect attendance at our events  suite rentals  sponsorship  advertising and hospitality spending  concession and souvenir sales and driving schools and other track rentals 
these factors also can affect the financial results of present and potential sponsors and other customers of our facilities and events and of the industry 
negative factors such as challenging economic conditions  governmental actions that impact spending  public concerns over additional national security incidents and air travel  particularly when combined  can impact corporate and individual customer spending and each negative factor can have varying effects on our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore stability to the credit and consumer markets and improve economic conditions in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that government response to the economic slowdown and disruptions in the financial and credit markets will stabilize the economy or financial and credit markets for long periods 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could lead to higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
these economic conditions might not improve or could worsen and when these conditions may ultimately improve cannot be determined at this time 
these severe economic conditions and governmental actions have and may further adversely impact various industries of our consumer and corporate customers  resulting in spending declines that could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be further adversely impacted by current or unforeseen economic conditions  thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
except as described in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we currently have no direct holdings in these higher risk type instruments and our indirect exposure to these instruments through money market funds or otherwise is immaterial 
however  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our current or future investment portfolios  if any  will remain unimpaired 
also  the financial stability of certain insurance companies that provide our insurance coverage could be adversely affected 
in that case  the ability of these insurance companies to pay our potential claims could be impaired  and we might not be able to obtain adequate replacement insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all 
any of these events could harm our business  and we cannot provide assurance that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties in obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our future financial position or operating results 
bad weather adversely affects the profitability of our motorsports events and postponement or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  driving schools and track rentals  among other things 
although we sell tickets well in advance of our events  poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations  particularly because we promote a limited number of premier events 
due to inclement weather conditions  we may be required to move a race event to the next raceable day  which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact our walk up admissions  if any  and food  beverage and souvenir sales 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
if an event scheduled for one of our facilities is postponed because of weather  national security  natural disasters or other reasons  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased rev speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents enues from admissions  food  beverage and souvenir sales generated at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we would incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues associated with the event  including live broadcast revenues  to the extent such losses were not covered by insurance 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar sprint cup or nationwide series  the amount of money we receive from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation could be reduced 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in television revenues in excess of amounts scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 
lack of competitiveness in nascar sprint cup series races or closeness of championship points races  the popularity of race car drivers or changes made by nascar on conducting  promoting and racing as a series sanctioning body  can significantly impact operating results 
a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races or the closeness of the championship points race in any particular racing season can significantly impact our operating results 
these and other factors  such as the popularity of race car drivers  can affect attendance  media attention and the promotional marketing appeal for sprint cup racing events  as well as other events surrounding the weekends such sprint cup races are promoted 
there can be no assurance that attendance or other event related revenues will not be adversely impacted by a lack of competitive racing or a close championship points race  or a decline in popularity of one or more race car drivers  in any particular season  thereby possibly impacting our operations and growth 
nascar periodically implements new rules or technical and other required changes for race teams and drivers  as well as event promoters  in attempts to increase safety  racing competition and fan interest  among other things 
for example  nascar introduced a new prototype car for the sprint cup series  the car of tomorrow  and is introducing a new redesigned car for the nationwide series  in efforts to increase competition on the speedways and generate increased fan interest and new marketing opportunities 
these and other new cars  and other periodically implemented changes  may or may not become more successful or popular with fans 
such factors can affect attendance and other event related revenues for our sprint cup and nationwide series racing events  as well as other events surrounding the weekends such races are promoted 
rule changes can increase operating costs that we may or may not be able to control 
there can be no assurance that attendance or other event related revenues or operating costs will not be adversely impacted by sanctioning body changes in any particular season  thereby possibly impacting our operations and growth 
the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations 
we pursue acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
we purchased nhms in january for million and kentucky in december for million 
these purchases were funded with available cash and borrowings under the credit facility 
the purchase of nhms and kentucky and other such transactions may involve significant challenges and risks 
for example  the transactions may not advance our business strategy  we may not realize a satisfactory return on the investments made  we may experience difficulty integrating new employees  business systems and technology  or management s attention may be diverted from our other businesses or operations 
furthermore  the use of cash or additional borrowings could significantly impact our liquidity  impair our ability to borrow additional funds for other business purposes or cause lowered ratings by credit agencies resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts  among other things 
these factors could adversely affect our future financial condition or operating results 
we may expand and improve the nhms and kentucky facilities  which may involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts or nature that have not yet been determined 
such expenditures may or may not increase our future success and the ability to compete and operate successfully and profitably depends on many factors outside of management s control 
such factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in possible impairment and other charges that materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
management may from time to time evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with our strategic direction 
for example  in we sold the majority of assets and all operations of north carolina speedway  consisting principally of track rentals  because advancement of our business strategy and the foreseeable returns on investment were not satisfactory 
furthermore  in we decided to discontinue our oil and gas operations as further discussed speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we may decide to spend  depending on perceived possibilities  or be required to spend certain additional amounts or take legal action to protect or preserve our oil and gas investment interests and maintain or maximize potential recovery values  if any 
such additional expenditures  although presently undeterminable  could become material depending on the facts  circumstances and ultimate outcome of any attempted recovery or resolution 
those costs  if significant and ultimately not recovered  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than optimal 
in addition  there is a risk that we will sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds expectations 
these factors could adversely affect our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
failure to be awarded a nascar event or deterioration in our relationship with nascar could adversely affect our profitability 
our success has been and will remain dependent to a significant extent upon maintaining a good working relationship with the organizations that sanction the races we promote at our facilities  particularly nascar  the sanctioning body for sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series races 
each nascar event is awarded on an annual basis 
although we believe our relationship with nascar is good  nonrenewal of a nascar event license would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to obtain nascar licenses to sponsor races at our facilities 
our strategy has included growth through the addition of motorsports facilities 
failure to obtain nascar events for any future additional motorsports facility could have a material adverse effect on us 
similarly  nascar is not obligated to modify its race schedules to allow us to schedule our races more efficiently or favorably 
kentucky presently annually hosts one nascar nationwide  one nascar camping world truck  one indycar series and other racing events  and does not currently host a nascar sprint cup series race 
we have requested realignment of a sprint cup series race to kentucky at the earliest possible time 
we are unable to predict if or when this realignment will occur 
until a sprint cup series race is held at kentucky  we are likely to incur cash and non cash operating losses that negatively impact our future financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
relocation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
increased costs associated with  and inability to obtain  adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
heightened concerns and challenges regarding property  casualty  liability  business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from the national incidents such as september  and natural disasters such as hurricane katrina 
we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our eight speedway facilities  which are generally located near highly populated cities and which hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical and situational factors  among others  have resulted in  and may continue to result in  significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits 
we cannot assure you that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability  thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurred or major motorsports events were cancelled and liability for personal injuries and product liability claims could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
while management attempts to obtain  and believes it presently has  reasonable policy limits of property  casualty  liability and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with financially sound insurers  we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property  casualty  liability and business interruption insurance currently in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  would be adequate should one or multiple catastrophic events occur at or near any of our speedway facilities  or speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents one or more of our major motorsports events were cancelled  or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 
once our present coverage expires  we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available  offered at reasonable costs  or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness 
the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if our asset damage or liability was to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 
the occurrence of additional national incidents  in particular incidents at sporting events  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
motorsports can be dangerous to participants and to spectators 
we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in management s judgment  to protect us from material financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by persons on our premises in the ordinary course of business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
we may incur significant costs from partial self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways and other properties and motorsports events and other business risks 
we may increase the marketing of certain products using self insured promotional warranty programs that could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number and amount of claims significantly increase 
we have increased and may further increase our self insurance limits  which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents  damages  casualties or other claims below such self insured limits increase 
management cannot guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase 
an increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
strong competition in the motorsports industry and with other professional and amateur sports could hinder our ability to maintain or improve our position in the industry 
motorsports promotion is a competitive industry 
we compete in regional and national markets  and with isc and other nascar related speedways  to promote events  especially nascar sanctioned sprint cup and nationwide series events  and to a lesser extent  with other speedway owners to promote other nascar  irl  nhra and woo sanctioned events 
we believe our principal competitors are other motorsports promoters of sprint cup and nationwide series or equivalent events 
certain of our competitors have resources that exceed ours 
nascar is owned by the france family  who also controls isc 
isc presently hosts a significant number of sprint cup and nationwide series races 
our competitors may attempt to build speedways and conduct racing and other motorsports related activities in new markets that may compete with us and our local and regional fan base or marketing opportunities 
we also compete for spectator interest with all forms of professional and amateur spring  summer and fall sports  such as football  baseball  basketball and hockey  conducted in and near atlanta  boston  bristol  charlotte  cincinnati  las vegas  dallas fort worth and san francisco  and regionally and nationally  many of which have resources that exceed ours  and with a wide range of other available entertainment and recreational activities 
these competing events and activities may be held on the same days or weekends as our events 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain or improve our position in light of such competition 
the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations and growth 
our success depends to a great extent upon the availability and performance of our senior management 
their experience within the industry  especially their working relationship with nascar  continues to be of considerable importance to us 
the loss of any of our key personnel due to illness  retirement or otherwise  or our inability to attract and retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business plans 
our credit facility permits significant expenditures for capital projects  investments in and transactions for motorsports and other ancillary businesses  and costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability 
we believe significant growth in our revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to meet long term increasing demand  to increase spectator entertainment value and to increase revenue 
as of december   our credit facility allows standby letters of credit of speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents up to million  capital expenditures of up to million  and provides for additional borrowings of up to million  subject to meeting specified conditions 
we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway 
as further described above in the risk factor the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations  we plan to continue to make substantial capital expenditures and investments  including significant renovations and improvements to kentucky and other capital expenditures involving nhms and other speedway facilities  in and future years 
the planned improvements will likely involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
the profitability or success of future capital projects and investments are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  many of which are beyond our control 
significant negative or unfavorable outcomes could reduce our available cash and cash investments resulting in lower investment interest or earnings  reduce our ability to service current or future indebtedness  require additional borrowings resulting in higher debt service and interest costs  lower our ratings by credit agencies  result in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties in borrowing additional amounts  result in higher than anticipated depreciation expense  among other negative consequences  and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
commencement of construction is subject to governmental approval and permitting processes  which could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions additional land acquisition costs increases in the cost of construction materials and labor unforeseen changes in design litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site national or regional economic  regulatory or geopolitical changes in addition  actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if those factors or our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
also  should improvement projects not produce a sufficiently high economic yield  including those requiring demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs limited to the revised estimated value of the project  capitalized expenditures could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
future impairment of our property and equipment  other intangible assets and goodwill could adversely affect our profitability 
as of december   we have net property and equipment of  million  net other intangible assets of million and goodwill of million 
also  as further described in the risk factor above the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations  we plan to continue to make substantial capital investments 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
management s latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the second quarter indicated there had been no impairment  and except for certain network and other media promotional contracts as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  there has since been no other events or circumstances that might indicate possible impairment as of december  as of december   our market capitalization was below its consolidated stockholder s equity 
management s analysis of the difference  along with additional information on the latest annual impairment assessment  is described in note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to consolidated financial statements and is not repeated here 
based on this analysis  management believes the decline in our market capitalization below its consolidated stockholder s equity is temporary  and that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired through and as of december  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no unrecognized impairment exists at december   different conditions  trends or assumptions or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our future financial condition or results of operations 
the profitability or success of future capital projects and investments are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  many of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could become impaired and materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
see the risk factor relocation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us above for related discussion on impairment considerations 
our equity investment in an associated entity could adversely affect our profitability 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  joint venture equity investment  our carrying value of our ma equity investment was reduced to at december  this reduction reflects our share of ma s sizable and impairment charges and historical operating results  and our other than temporary impairment charge for ma 
additional information on our and ma s impairment analysis is described in note to the consolidated financial statements and is not repeated here 
these impairment evaluations are subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  could have a material effect on the outcome of these impairment evaluations 
ma is facing significant operating challenges and is in technical default of certain of its license agreements that are material to the viability of the business  which raises substantial doubt about ma s ability to continue as a going concern 
also  ma is in non compliance with one affirmative covenant under ma s credit and security agreement 
however  as of march   we have been informed that ma s lender has not taken restrictive action with regards to this technical default and has allowed ma to continue to operate under the credit and security agreement while monitoring their situation 
as of march   there were no borrowings under ma s credit and security agreement 
ma is attempting to renegotiate its license agreements with essentially all present significant licensors of nascar merchandising on terms that allow ma reasonable future opportunities to operate profitably 
should such negotiations not be successful  should ma management decide to allow license defaults to remain uncured or should licensors not grant extended cure periods and exercise their rights under the agreements  ma s business and its ability to continue operating could be severely impacted 
there can be no assurance that these licensors will agree to revise contracted license terms  or continue to grant ma licensing rights  on acceptable terms 
ma is exploring other business strategies to turn its business around 
ma continues to restructure its business by implementing process improvements  cost reduction initiatives  improved inventory risk management  and streamlining operations 
if such efforts are not sufficient or timely  ma could ultimately pursue bankruptcy 
ma s future profits or losses  and ability to generate sufficient financial resources  could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors such as i economic conditions and consumer and corporate spending sentiment and trends  including prolonged recessionary conditions  ii the success of motorsports  the popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  and the magnitude and timing of its licensed driver and team changes  particularly for nascar s sprint cup series  iii increased competition for products sold under non exclusive ma licenses  expanded licensing by licensors to competitors selling products similar to those under non exclusive ma licenses  and nonrenewal of exclusive or non exclusive ma licenses upon expiration  iv deterioration in customer relationships and v the success of ma management in achieving sustained profitability 
many of these operating factors are outside management s control 
under equity method accounting  we will no longer record our share of future ma operating losses  if any  unless and until this carrying value is increased from additional company investments in ma or to the extent of future ma operating profits  if any 
as of december   we a had contingent guarantee obligation associated with ma that is limited to million  decreases annually  and expires through based on specified terms and conditions 
should ma have insufficient future financial resources and such obligation remains due  we could be required to fund part or all of the guarantee up to the obligation amount determined at that time 
although reasonably possible that some obligation could arise in the future  the amount  if any  is not reasonably estimable at this time 
as such  management believes no obligation should be recorded at this time 
we could increase our investment in ma  in the form of additional equity contributions or loans  in amounts that could be material 
we speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents could be required to record an impairment charge for any future carrying value of this equity investment under equity method accounting  including any additional company investments  and for our contingent guarantee obligation  if funding was required 
such charges could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position  ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments  and ability to pay dividends 
we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total outstanding long term debt of approximately million  or million excluding issuance discount of million  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our substantial indebtedness and leverage could make it more difficult and costly for us to borrow money in the future and may reduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations and other business activities and may have other important consequences  including the following we will have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal  debt redemption premium  if any  and interest on our debt  which will reduce funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and other corporate purposes  our ability to adjust to adverse or changing market conditions and withstand competitive pressures could be limited  and we may be vulnerable to additional risk if there is a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business  we may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less leverage and greater operating and financial flexibility than we do  increase our interest costs or increase the risks that we may not be able to obtain additional financing or obtain financing at acceptable rates  increase our difficulties in refinancing or replacing our outstanding obligations such as the scheduled maturities of our credit facility in july and senior subordinated notes in may  and cause lowered ratings by credit agencies  resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts 
each or all of the factors could have a material adverse affect our financial health and profitability 
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our indebtedness and is therefore not available for use in our business 
in  we paid million in interest on our indebtedness  and our interest costs in could increase 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  legislative  regulatory  industry  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
our operations are substantially impacted by the success of nascar in the promotion and conduct of racing as a sanctioning body  our relationship with nascar and the popularity of nascar and other motorsports generally  and the impact of competition  including competition from other speedway owners like isc 
our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes or senior notes at any time at annually declining redemption premiums ranging from of par in fiscal years beginning june  to par after june   and of par in fiscal years beginning june  to par after june   respectively  which could limit funds otherwise available for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 
however  we may not be able to complete such refinancing or redemption on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the downturn in the credit markets has increased the cost of borrowing and has made financing difficult to obtain 
our future borrowing costs on current outstanding or future indebtedness could substantially increase and adversely affect our financial health and profitability  each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents the purchases of nhms and kentucky significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and leverage  and our current or future capital spending plans could further significantly increase our future outstanding debt  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial health and profitability 
as of december   we had total outstanding long term debt of approximately million and the credit facility permits additional borrowings of up to million 
the ongoing disruptions in the financial and capital markets  including severely tightened credit markets  and stringent and costly borrowing conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on our future interest and other borrowing costs 
our operating results have benefited from relatively low interest rates on our floating rate credit facility and future increases  if significant  could have a significant adverse impact on our future results 
also  our future interest and borrowing costs under our credit facility  any refinanced or replaced current outstanding indebtedness  or new additional financing could substantially increase and adversely affect our financial health and profitability 
interest and other borrowing costs have significantly increased for many companies in numerous industries  and may increase from current levels in the foreseeable future 
while  at times  we use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk  we are currently unable to predict if or when the interest rates could change 
also  we are unable to predict if or when the currently tight credit markets may improve 
our significant indebtedness levels and leverage  along with difficult credit market conditions  could result in higher interest and other borrowing costs and more restrictive financial and other loan covenants under any new credit facility or other borrowing arrangements 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  interest rates under our credit facility are based on specified tier levels that are adjustable periodically based upon certain ratios of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
our current planned or unplanned future capital spending and possible increases in our future outstanding indebtedness  along with our current leverage  could further reduce the amounts by which we exceed minimum required covenant compliance levels and result in changes to our interest cost tier levels under the credit facility 
future changes in such surplus in our compliance levels or interest cost tiers could result in increased interest costs on current or future indebtedness  restricted or reduced borrowings and availability under the credit facility  and increased costs of borrowing for any new financing 
each or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and profitability 
restrictions imposed by terms of our indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing 
the indentures for our senior notes and senior subordinated notes and the credit facility agreement restrict  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to do any of the following incur additional debt  pay dividends or make distributions  incur liens  make specified types of investments  apply net proceeds from certain asset sales  engage in transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate  pay dividends or make other payments from subsidiaries  sell equity interests of subsidiaries  sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets  and incur indebtedness that is subordinate in right of payment to any senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to the senior notes or the senior subordinated notes 
because of the significance of our outstanding indebtedness  debt covenant compliance is important to our operations 
our credit facility is the primary source of committed funding from which we finance our planned capital expenditures  strategic initiatives  such as repurchases of our common stock  and working capital needs 
our credit facility contains more extensive and restrictive covenants than the indentures for the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
in addition to covenants of the type described above  the credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  as well as limits our acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments  as further described in future liquidity 
the company regularly monitors compliance with the various covenants under each of these debt agreements 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
future speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents default on any of these covenants could result in default under  or an inability to undertake certain activities in compliance with  the underlying debt agreements 
non compliance with financial covenant ratios or other covenants could prevent us from being able to access further borrowings under  or require repayment of  our credit facility 
our ability to meet those covenants  financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that we will meet those tests 
the credit facility  the senior notes  and the senior subordinated notes indentures contain cross default provisions 
a default under any of these debt agreements could likely trigger cross default provisions allowing the lenders  in each case  to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements 
if there were an event of default under any loan agreement  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding  including accrued interest or other obligations  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay these amounts  such lenders could proceed against the collateral  if any  granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if any indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we could repay or refinance the accelerated amounts due 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted 
we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
should we pursue further development and or acquisition opportunities  the timing  size and success as well as associated potential capital commitments of which are unknown at this time  we may need to raise additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that adequate debt and equity financing will be available  if and when needed  on satisfactory terms or will be permitted under the covenants of the credit facility  senior notes or senior subordinated notes 
failure to obtain further financing could have a negative effect on our business and operations 
management believes the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes as of december  at this time  management also believes the company will remain in compliance with all applicable covenants for at least the next months 
however  although not anticipated at this time  significant negative adverse factors such as material tangible  intangible or other asset impairment charges or unforeseen declines in our future profitability or cash flows from ongoing recessionary conditions or other market factors  if large enough individually or in combination  could result in our inability to remain in compliance 
these and other possible negative factors that could impact compliance are further described throughout this risk factors section 
we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
despite our level of indebtedness  we may be permitted to incur additional debt in the future 
in addition  we may be able to secure this additional debt with company  subsidiary or new business assets 
at december   we had approximately million of additional revolving loans available for borrowing under the credit facility 
the indenture governing the senior notes permits us to refinance our senior subordinated notes due  which are subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes  with senior indebtedness that would rank pari passu in right of payment to the senior notes  at any time 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks we now face could intensify 
furthermore  any additional financing arrangements we enter into may contain additional restrictive and financial covenants 
these covenants may restrict or prohibit many actions  including  but not limited to  our ability to incur debt  create or suffer to exist liens  make prepayments of particular debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures or investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  issue capital stock  sell certain assets and engage in mergers and consolidations or in sale leaseback transactions 
failure to maintain compliance with any new covenants could constitute a default  which could accelerate the payment of any amounts outstanding under any new or existing financial agreements 
government regulation of certain motorsports sponsors could negatively impact the availability of promotion  sponsorship and advertising revenue for us 
the motorsports industry generates significant revenue each year from the promotion  sponsorship and advertising of various companies and their products  some of which are subject to government regulation 
advertising of the alcoholic beverage and tobacco industry is generally subject to greater governmental regulation than advertising by other sponsors of our events 
certain speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents of our sponsorship contracts are terminable upon the implementation of adverse regulations 
the alcoholic beverage and tobacco industry has provided substantial financial support to the motorsports industry through  among other things  the purchase of advertising time  the sponsorship of racing teams and the past sponsorship of racing series such as the busch now nationwide series  and generally are subject to greater governmental regulation than are other sponsors of our events 
we are unaware of any proposed additional governmental regulation that would materially limit the availability to motorsports of promotion  sponsorship or advertising revenue from the alcoholic beverage or tobacco industry 
we cannot assure you that the alcoholic beverage or tobacco industry will continue to sponsor motorsports events  suitable alternative sponsors could be located or nascar will continue to sanction individual racing events sponsored by the alcoholic beverage industry at any of our facilities 
implementation of further restrictions on the advertising or promotion of alcoholic beverage products could adversely affect us 
our chairman owns a majority of our common stock and will control any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders

in addition  as a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules  we also qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements  including the requirement that we have nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees composed entirely of independent directors 
although we qualify  we do not currently use this controlled company exemption 
our oil and gas business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of our other operations 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in the fourth quarter  we decided to discontinue our oil and gas operations primarily because of ongoing challenges and business risks in conducting these activities in foreign countries  particularly russia 
based on an impairment assessment  the estimated fair values of our consolidated foreign investments in oil and gas operations were found substantially diminished and written off as of december  through an impairment charge included in our loss from discontinued operation 
these oil and gas operations have involved business  credit and other risks different from our motorsports operations and the ability to invest and compete successfully and profitably has been subject to many factors outside management s control 
many of the operating risks and challenges have involved difficult or restrictive governmental situations when attempting to conduct business  access or transfer assets or funds  or facilitate production and similar activities in russia and other foreign countries 
for each of these investment interests  we may decide to spend  depending on perceived possibilities  or be required to spend certain additional amounts or take legal action to protect or preserve our interest to maintain or maximize the potential recovery value and to protect other aspects of our oil and gas investments 
such additional expenditures  although presently undeterminable  could become material depending on the facts  circumstances and ultimate outcome of any attempted recovery or resolution 
those costs  if significant and ultimately not recovered  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of discontinued operations or cash flows 
there are many risks generally associated with oil and gas related activities  including environmental  commodities and similar risks common to such activities 
our discontinued oil and gas business has included exploration and production activities that have been less successful than previously anticipated 
these investments involve a variety of operating risks  including fires  explosions  blow outs  surface cratering and casing collapse  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas and formation water  natural disasters  such as earthquakes  and adverse weather conditions  and environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and pipeline ruptures 
realization of receivables  investments and other assets are subject to many factors outside management s control 
factors that can adversely impact realization include changes or deterioration in customer financial condition and creditworthiness  current and future market demand  customary risks associated with oil and gas exploration  production and other business activities  regional and global market demand and economic conditions  including geopolitical situations in and surrounding specific coun speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k

changes in income tax laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of  at december   valuation allowances of million have been provided against deferred tax assets because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
changes in tax laws  assumptions  estimates or method used in the accounting for income taxes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
environmental costs may negatively impact our financial condition 
solid waste landfilling has occurred on and around the property at cms for many years 
if damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment is determined to have been caused by the conduct of our business or by pollutants used  generated or disposed of by us  or which may be found on our property  we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation or remediation  or both  of such contamination or damage 
the amount of such liability  as to which we are self insured  could be material 
state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment also can include noise abatement laws that may be applicable to our racing events 
changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or requirements  or the discovery of previously unknown conditions  could require additional significant expenditures by us for remediation and compliance 
land use laws may negatively impact our growth 
our development of new motorsports facilities and  to a lesser extent  the expansion of existing facilities requires compliance with applicable federal  state and local land use planning  zoning and environmental regulations 
regulations governing the use and development of real estate may prevent us from acquiring or developing prime locations for motorsports facilities  substantially delay or complicate the process of improving existing facilities or increase the costs of any such activities 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future exercises or future grants of stock options  restricted stock awards or other stock based compensation  the sale of shares held by key personnel  or the default of loans under which some of our common stock is pledged 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by the sale of approximately  shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of various options under our equity compensation plans  by the issuance or sale of approximately  shares of our common stock available for grant under our equity compensation plans  or by the sale of approximately  shares of our common stock available for resale in compliance with rule under the securities act  including shares held by mr

the company sponsors and promotes outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
management does not believe the company s financial performance has been materially affected by inflation

table of contents near term operating factors there are many factors that affect the company s growth potential  future operations and financial results  including the following operating factors that are discussed below or elsewhere in this report as indicated items discussed in this section general operating factors including ongoing uncertainty of the weak economic conditions and tightened credit and financial markets also discussed in item a risk factors our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant non event and event souvenir and other merchandising revenues earnings guidance items discussed elsewhere in indicated sections of this report issuance of senior notes due in aggregate principal of million in may discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  below in future liquidity  and item a risk factors amendment and restatement of the company s credit facility in july discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  below in future liquidity  and item a risk factors motorsports authentics merchandising joint venture  including impairment charges discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors impairment charge on certain intangible assets in discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements eight year nascar broadcasting rights agreement discussed below in future liquidity possible capital expenditures discussed below in liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures and item a risk factors discontinued oil and gas operations discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors additional repurchases of common stock approved discussed in future liquidity stock repurchase program quarterly cash dividends on common stock discussed below in liquidity and capital resources dividends general factors and current operating trends the company s results for the race season reflect decreases in admissions  luxury suite rentals  track rentals  driving schools  onsite advertising  nascar ancillary rights  souvenir merchandising  sponsorships  food and beverage concessions and other event related revenue categories 
management believes these revenues were negatively impacted by declines in consumer and corporate spending from the recession  difficult credit and housing markets  and other economic factors as further described below 
despite the year over year declines  we believe these results position us favorably relative to other destination based entertainment companies  and demonstrate that our core fan and corporate customer interest remains strong for smi s premier venues 
for upcoming events  ticket sales at most of the company s major events are below ticket sales at this same time last year 
in  and again in  management has reduced many ticket and concession prices  offered extended payment terms to many ticket buyers although generally not beyond when events are held  and implemented various promotional campaigns to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
lower ticket prices in constituted approximately of the total decline in admissions revenues for nascar sanctioned sprint cup and nationwide series racing events as compared to also  the company has increased advertising and other promotional activities to help offset the ongoing impact of these adverse economic and market conditions 
admission revenues have declined recently from both fewer fans attending our race events and from lower average ticket prices resulting from these special promotions 
while lower ticket prices and extended payment terms can affect operating margins and lengthen cash flow cycles as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment 
however  at this early date  management is unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated 
many of the company s nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event sponsorships  and for years beyond  are already sold 
the broadcast television and cable ratings for the nascar sprint cup and nationwide series have shown decreases from the prior year  and are showing year to date decreases for however  almost million fans attended the company s events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents strong even in challenging circumstances 
also  the sprint cup series continues as the second highest rated regular season televised sport only the national football league is higher  and the nascar nationwide series was the second  and the nascar camping world truck series was the third  highest rated motorsports series on television 
as described below  much of our future revenues are already contracted under these and other long term contracts  including television broadcasting rights revenue 
in and future seasons  nascar has made  and will likely continue making  refinements to racing rules  technical changes and other adjustments as a sanctioning body to enhance on track racing competition and excitement and generate additional fan interest 
such refinements include the recently reintroduced double file restarts  changing from rear wings to spoilers on certain car of tomorrow models  and introducing a new redesigned race car for the nationwide racing series 
also  the introduction of female race drivers  such as danica patrick into the nationwide race series  is expected to generate substantial media interest and focus  and represents one of the many sizeable and largely untapped demographics in nascar racing 
we believe these  as well as other ongoing industry developments  are favorable  long term industry changes that provide us with many new marketing and future growth opportunities 
many economic and geopolitical factors  including those described in item a risk factors which are not repeated here  have and may continue to dampen consumer and corporate spending 
many factors related to discretionary consumer and corporate spending are adversely impacting recreational and entertainment spending resulting in a negative impact on our motorsports and non motorsports activities 
as reflected in our earnings guidance below  we believe reduced consumer and corporate spending will continue to negatively impact admissions  sponsorship  advertising and hospitality spending  concession and souvenir sales demand  driving school  and luxury suite and other track rentals  with related effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
as further described in item a risk factors  a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races  the closeness of the championship points race  race car driver popularity  and the success of nascar racing in general  in any particular racing season  can also significantly impact our operating results 
these and other factors can affect attendance  media attention and the marketing appeal of sprint cup racing events  as well as other events surrounding sprint cup race weekends 
historically low levels of consumer confidence  difficult residential real estate and mortgage markets  unprecedented stock market declines  tight consumer and business credit markets  among other recessionary conditions and geopolitical and economic factors  have dampened and may continue to dampen consumer spending 
the strength of the us economy  including the financial and credit markets  currently remains uncertain due to these factors 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore stability to the credit and consumer markets and improve economic conditions in the foreseeable future 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could lead to higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowings conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
whether or when these severe conditions might improve cannot be determined at this time 
each of these negative factors  and particularly when combined  have and may further adversely impact various industries of our present and potential consumer and corporate customers  resulting in further spending declines that could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
certain nascar sprint cup and nationwide race team owners have announced difficulties in securing adequate sponsorship funding for and possibly future racing seasons 
it is believed that these difficult economic and market factors are resulting in delayed decisions regarding race team sponsorship by certain current and potential new sponsors 
without adequate sponsorship funding  some team owners could decide not to operate  participate in fewer races  or operate fewer race cars for multi car teams 
a reduced number of racing competitors  particularly popular drivers  could lessen on track competition and the appeal of racing 
also  new or changed racing teams could be formed with drivers that generate less fan interest or race less competitively 
these and similar factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  that can significantly impact our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results  cash flows and growth 
however  management believes our strong operating cash flow will continue  and that long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should grow when recessionary conditions end 
our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant much of our total revenue is generated under long term contracts  which management believes helps solidify our financial strength and stabilize our earnings and cash flows 
the term of the speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents eight year nascar television broadcast agreement is through  and many of our sponsorships and other corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years  which helps provide revenue and other financial stability 
we believe the attractive demographics surrounding motorsports and our premier markets  where we own first class facilities  continue to provide substantial opportunities for increasing our number of longer term sponsorship partners and commitments 
we also have contracted revenues under several long term operating leases for various office  warehouse and industrial park space to various entities largely involved in motorsports 
we believe the substantial amount of total revenue generated under our long term contracts  such as those described above  helps stabilize the company s financial resilience and profitability during difficult recessionary economic conditions 
the company s naming rights agreement that renamed charlotte motor speedway as lowe s motor speedway expired after  and will not be renewed 
the expiring agreement provided significant contracted revenues  and there can be no assurance the company will execute any replacement agreements on acceptable terms 
the company does not expect costs incurred for renaming the speedway facility  and replacing promotional signage  materials and merchandise  to have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
non event and event souvenir and other merchandising revenues management continues to seek new merchandising opportunities  including expanded product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and marketing of motorsports and non motorsports related souvenir merchandise at our speedways  third party speedways and other venues  and with corporate customers 
the company s merchandising event related and other operating revenues may increase or decrease depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts 
future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  recessionary and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports and popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s sprint cup series  the success of the car of tomorrow or other future redesigned racing cars  increased competition for products sold under non exclusive licenses  expanded licensing by licensors to competitors selling products similar to those under non exclusive licenses  nonrenewal of exclusive or non exclusive licenses upon expiration  and other competition for the company s non event products and outside venues 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
such changes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse impact on the outcome of management s realization assessment and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on provisions reflected for inventory realization assessments

the overall increase was partially offset by higher recovery allowances for certain oil and gas transactions  including a disputed guarantee  and to higher operating costs for oil and gas activities in  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents net income for increased by million  or  over such income for this change is due to the factors discussed above 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business has been  and is expected to remain  somewhat seasonal 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and changes in the company s operations  including speedway acquisitions  with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
for example  nhms was purchased in january  and is presently scheduled to hold one nascar sprint cup racing event in the second and third quarters each year  and operating income will likely continue to be positively impacted in those quarters and negatively impacted in the first and fourth quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s motorsports business 
the quarterly information below shows excerpted results from the company s quarterly reports on form q filed in the years ended december  and see results of operations racing events and year over year comparisons of operating results above for additional information on the company s major nascar sanctioned racing events held in and the second quarter operating results reflect a non cash impairment charge of million with no income tax benefit to reduce the company s carrying value of its equity investment in ma to estimated fair value 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  joint venture equity investment  the fourth quarter results reflect impairment charges of million with no income tax benefit to further reduce this carrying value to various operating and economic challenges  including increased uncertainty of ma s ability to compete successfully and profitably in certain product channels  and to achieve previously contemplated future business initiatives  led to evaluating ma s carrying value and long lived assets for impairment 
the fourth quarter operating results also reflect a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million for intangible assets pertaining to certain promotional contracts as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in the fourth quarter  the company decided to discontinue its oil and gas operations and all prior periods presented have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operation reflects a fourth quarter impairment charge associated with oil and gas investments 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the effective income tax rate for is substantially higher than due primarily to reflecting valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with equity investee losses because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has historically met its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
significant changes in the company s financial condition and liquidity in resulted primarily from net cash provided by operations amounting to million  borrowings under long term debt amounting to million  repayments of borrowings under long term debt amounting to million  payments of debt issuance costs amounting to million  payments of quarterly cash dividends amounting to million  repurchases of common stock amounting to million  and cash outlays for capital expenditures amounting to million 
net income or loss was impacted by the following non cash activities  among other items  i large equity investee losses in and as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  ii an impairment charge in for intangible assets pertaining to certain promotional contracts as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and iii impairment charges in pertaining to discontinued oil and gas operations as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements

future liquidity at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million  short term investments totaled  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility amounted to million  and outstanding letters of credit amounted to  at december   the company had availability for borrowing up to an additional million  including up to an additional million in letters of credit  under the credit facility 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
the company anticipates that cash from operations and funds available through the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its operating needs at least through the next twelve months  including estimated planned capital expenditures  additional repurchases of common stock  if any  income tax liabilities  payment of future declared dividends  if any  and additional investments  loans or funding of contingent obligations pertaining to its motorsports authentics joint venture  if any 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  the company may  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
the company may  from time to time  redeem or retire its debt securities  and purchase its debt and equity securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  permissibility under the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and the senior notes  and other factors as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and the senior notes agreements do not restrict the ability of the company s subsidiaries to transfer  advance or dividend funds to the parent company  smi  or other subsidiaries 
while management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from the company s existing speedway operations  additional liquidity and other resources could be needed to fund continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of the company s speedways  other facilities and ancillary businesses 
as further described below in capital expenditures and item a risk factors  in and future years  the company plans to continue making significant renovations and improvements  as well as other capital expenditures  involving its speedway facilities 
the planned improvements will likely involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
the purchases of nhms and kentucky significantly increased the company s outstanding indebtedness and leverage  and current or future capital spending plans could further significantly increase future outstanding debt  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial health and profitability 
as further described below  we completed a private placement of senior notes in aggregate principal amount of million in may  and amended and restated our long term  senior secured revolving credit facility in july the new senior notes increased our indebtedness levels and leverage  and the amended and restated credit facility contains higher adjustable interest rate tiers and more restrictive financial ratio covenants 
as further discussed in general factors and current operating trends and earnings guidance above  various economic  geopolitical and industry factors may continue to dampen consumer and corporate spending 
we believe this reduced spending will continue to negatively impact admissions and event related revenues  with related effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
our operating results have benefited from lower interest rates under the credit facility prior to amendment 
the tightened credit and financial markets have resulted in higher interest and other borrowing costs and more restrictive financial covenants for many companies in numerous industries 
at present outstanding debt levels  higher interest costs from increased indebtedness and interest rates will negatively impact our future profitability and cash flows 
these factors  as well as others  could make compliance with restrictive financial covenants more difficult 
see item a risk factors for additional risk factors related to our indebtedness 
management believes the most restrictive financial covenant contained in our debt agreements is the credit facility requirement that we maintain minimum financial ratios of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense  as defined 
the minimum required ratio is no less than to on december   increasing to no less than to on june  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents and to on december  the company was in compliance with this and all other debt covenants as of december  management actively monitors compliance with this and all other financial covenants 
if future events result in a significant reduction in the surplus between the required minimum ratio and our actual ratio  management is prepared to take certain actions to remain compliant 
although management believes that these circumstances are unlikely  such actions could include  for example  loan repayments or refinancing  reducing capital expenditures or operating expenses where practical  or obtaining loan compliance waivers 
at this time  management believes that we can maintain compliance with this and all other debt covenants for at least the next twelve months 
however  similar to many entities with respect to these type matters  we can provide no assurance that further deteriorations in our profitability or cash flows  or other unforeseen negative operating factors or conditions  would not result in non compliance with this or any other debt covenant 
any such non compliance could have a material adverse affect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows  and our ability to maintain compliance can be affected by events beyond our control 
as further described item a risk factors  possible material adverse affects from non compliance could include  among others  cross default under any or all of our debt agreements and acceleration of all amounts outstanding

the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes as of december  eight year nascar broadcasting and multi year ancillary rights agreements broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for the company s core business 
a substantial portion of the company s profit in recent years has resulted from a significant increase in television revenues received from nascar contracts with various television networks 
nascar ratings can impact attendance at company events and sponsorship opportunities 
we participate in the recent combined eight year nascar agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic television broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events for through nascar announced that these agreements have an approximate billion contract period value  representing approximately million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and a increase over the former contract annual average of million 
this eight year nascar broadcasting rights arrangement provides the company with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
the company s nascar broadcasting revenues totaled approximately million and  based on the current race schedule  these contracted revenues for are expected to approximate million 
in  an ancillary rights package for nascar 
com  nascar radio  international and other broadcasting  nascar images  sportsvision  fanscan  specialty pay per view telecasts  and other media content distribution was reached with us  nascar and others in the motorsports industry 
nascar has announced industry wide total ancillary rights fees are estimated to approximate million over a year period  which ends in management also believes these contracts have long term strategic benefits 
for instance  cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which is resulting in increased rights fees for sports properties 
nascar s decision to retain approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television is believed to be important to the sport s future growth 
the retention of both cable and network broadcasters should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three nascar racing series which should help bolster long term attendance and corporate marketing appeal 
management believes espn s involvement should result in the nationwide series benefiting from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn  and motorsports in general should benefit from increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to that espn provides with the other major sports 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents management believes these long term contracted revenue sources help solidify the company s financial strength and stabilize earnings and cash flows 
future changes in race schedules would impact broadcasting revenues 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the current eight year television broadcasting agreement with various television networks was negotiated and contracted by nascar  and the company is not a party to the agreement 
the company s share of these television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis for each nascar sanctioned racing event scheduled to be held by the company in the upcoming season year 
under these annual agreements  the company is obligated to conduct the event in the manner stipulated under the terms and conditions of the respective sanctioning agreements 
stock repurchase program the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing smi to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of the company s outstanding common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price  applicable limitations under the credit facility  senior subordinated notes and senior notes  and other factors the board of directors or their designees  in their sole discretion  may consider relevant

the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
during  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
as of december   the company could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current authorization 
capital expenditures management believes significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   the company had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and make other site improvements at its speedways 
in  the company plans to renovate and modernize the infield at bms and repave various track surfaces and improve traffic infrastructure 
the company also plans to replace certain cms seating with new  wider premium permanent seating along its front stretch grandstands  and may begin renovating and modernizing the infield and certain permanent seating at kentucky 
similar to prior years  the company plans to continue modernizing and expanding media centers  concessions  camping and hospitality areas  restrooms and other fan amenities 
the company also plans to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  and reconfigure traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at its speedways 
in future periods  the company may make other various improvements and renovations at cms and nhms  each of which may involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
kentucky state lawmakers passed legislation that provides tax incentives for certain qualifying capital projects that would facilitate expansion and improvement of kentucky facilities within the next few years 
under such legislation  qualifying projects must conduct events that are in the top league  series or sanctioned level of their type of event  as defined  have not been previously held in kentucky  provide permanent seating for  spectators and be broadcast nationally  among other terms and conditions 
depending on the amounts and limits of passed tax incentives  the company is contemplating significantly expanding permanent seating at kentucky  and has begun reconfiguring and expanding onsite roads  available parking  traffic patterns and entrances  and modernizing and expanding concessions  camping  restrooms and other speedway facilities 
the contemplated expansion and improvements will involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has a contingent obligation for additional kentucky purchase consideration of million  payable in monthly installments of  upon satisfaction of both of the following conditions i kentucky state lawmakers successfully passing the previously described legislation and ii the company must conduct a nascar sanctioned sprint cup series racing event at kentucky 
management is unable to determine if or when kentucky will conduct a sprint cup series race  triggering the contingent obligation 
the company intends to fund such contingent obligation  if it becomes payable  with available cash and cash investments 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents at this time  aggregate payments for capital expenditures in are estimated to approximate to million 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under the credit facility as needed 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at its facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions additional land acquisition costs increases in the cost of construction materials and labor unforeseen changes in design litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site national or regional economic changes in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes which  if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company also continually evaluates new opportunities that will add value for its stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of quarterly or annual common stock dividends depends upon the company s results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility  senior subordinated notes and senior notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility allows aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million each year  increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture and the senior notes indenture permit dividend payments each year of up to approximately and per share of common stock  respectively  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  this quarterly cash dividend is being paid using available cash and cash investments subject to the limitations and considerations described in the preceding paragraph 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  the credit facility provides for a separate sub limit for letters of credit of up to million 
as of december   the company had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of  also  as of december   the company had a contingent guarantee obligation associated with an equity investee limited to million  which decreases annually and expires through based on specified terms and conditions 
should the equity investee have insufficient future financial resources and such obligation remains due  the company could be required to fund part or all of the guarantee up to the obligation amount determined at that time 
although reasonably possible that some obligation could arise in the future  the amount  if any  is not reasonably estimable at this time 
as such  management believes no obligation should be recorded at this time 
the company presently does not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on its financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company follows applicable authoritative guidance which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  the company evaluates long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using applicable authoritative guidance 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment considerations are also described in item a risk factors above 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a million pre tax impairment charge in for goodwill and other intangible assets associated with recent potentially unfavorable developments for certain promotional contracts and operations of tsi 
as of december   the company s market capitalization was below its consolidated shareholder s equity 
management analyzed the difference for possible impairment as further described in note to the financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets  and there has since been no other events or circumstances which indicate possible impairment as of december  based on this analysis  management believes the decline in the company s market capitalization below its consolidated shareholder s equity is temporary and not an indicator of impairment  and that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of december  evaluation of recoverability is subjective and speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management believes no unrecognized impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists at december  however  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of impairment evaluations and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the company has net property and equipment of  million and insignificant net amortizable intangible assets as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company has nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because the company has a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on its financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net current deferred tax assets totaled  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for noncurrent deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million are provided against deferred tax assets 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements and below  the change was due primarily to reflecting valuation allowances of approximately million against deferred tax assets  primarily associated with equity investee losses of motorsports authentics because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not 
the company s effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense
