item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles rvs and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our market share in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the industry towables is approximately before giving effect to the heartland acquisition 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have a market share of approximately 
our market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we also manufacture and sell foot buses at our facility in southern california 
on march   we acquired sjc industries corp 
sjc  a privately held manufacturer of ambulances based in elkhart  indiana 
we believe that sjc is currently the second largest manufacturer of ambulances in the united states 
the operations of sjc are included in the company s operating results from the date of its acquisition 
we have included the operations of sjc in our buses reportable segment because we believe the ambulance business is a natural fit with thor s bus business 
sjc has similar economic characteristics to our bus businesses and the nature of products  production processes  types of customers  distribution channels and regulatory environment are also similar to those within our bus businesses 
our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the rv industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
capital expenditures of  in fiscal were made primarily to purchase land and buildings to expand our towable operations  replace buildings and equipment at our champion facility that were destroyed by a fire  upgrade it systems and replace machinery and equipment used in the ordinary course of business 
our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon the profitability of the business unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  purchasing  insurance  legal and human resource  risk management and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 

table of contents our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we generally do not finance dealers directly but do provide repurchase agreements to assist the dealers in obtaining floor plan financing 
on november   we reported that wade fb thompson  our co founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  passed away 
he was succeeded by peter b 
orthwein  also a co founder of the company  to the offices of chairman  president and chief executive officer 
we proceeded with our business uninterrupted 
on february   a fire resulted in the total loss of our  square foot champion general coach of america gca north bus production facility 
we reacted immediately and consolidated production into our  square foot south facility  which was unaffected by the fire  and leased a  square foot facility on a monthly basis 
we resumed production on february  and no significant orders were lost due to the fire 
a new champion gca plant is being built and it is substantially completed and operational as of september  in october  we decided to close our citair general coach production facility in oliver  british columbia and move all general coach rv and park model production to our other citair general coach facility in hensall  ontario 
as of april   all production ceased at the citair oliver facility 
related closure costs of approximately  were recorded in fiscal  consisting of  primarily in cost of products sold for inventory and warranty and  in severance and other costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
on april   we sold our citair travel trailer and park model business to a former member of citair s management 
citair did business in canada under the names general coach  hensall and general coach  oliver 
we recorded a pre tax loss on the sale 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we purchased  shares of our common stock at per share at a total cost of  and currently hold the shares as treasury stock 
we repurchased the shares from the estate of wade fb thompson the estate in a private transaction 
the repurchase transaction was evaluated and approved by members of our board of directors who were not affiliated with the estate 
at the time of the repurchase  the shares represented of our outstanding common stock 
we used available cash to purchase the shares 
on september   we acquired of towables holdings  inc  parent company of heartland recreation vehicles  llc heartland pursuant to a stock purchase agreement for  in cash  subject to adjustment  and  shares of our common stock 
heartland is located in elkhart  indiana and is a major manufacturer of towable recreation vehicles 
under our ownership  heartland will continue as an independent operation  in the same manner as our existing recreation vehicle and bus companies  and its operations will be included in our towable segment 
the acquisition of heartland is expected to be accretive to our earnings  based upon heartland s recent and historical performances 
from its founding in  heartland has become the third largest manufacturer of fifth wheels and the sixth largest manufacturer of travel trailers in the united states based upon statistical surveys retail market data as of june  heartland has been the fastest growing rv manufacturer in recent years  and its sales over the last months exceeded  its brands include bighorn  sundance  cyclone  north country  and north trail  sold through a nationwide network of dealers 
trends and business outlook industry conditions in the rv market have been adversely affected over the past two years by low consumer confidence  tighter lending practices and the general economic downturn 
as a result  in fiscal retail sales decreased and dealers significantly reduced their inventory levels 
wholesale and retail credit availability has improved  resulting in significantly less discounting in fiscal as compared to fiscal according to the rvia economist  dr 
richard curtin  who is the director of surveys of consumers at the university of michigan  calendar year wholesale shipments are forecast to total  units  a increase over rvia forecasts that calendar year shipments will total  units  a further improvement over expected wholesale shipments 
during fiscal we have experienced growth in our sales and margins 
if retail and wholesale credit availability continues to improve  we expect to see a continuing rebound in sales and expect to benefit from our ability to ramp up production in an industry with fewer manufacturing facilities than before  due to competitor failures or plant consolidations 
a longer term positive outlook for the recreation vehicle segment is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales  and an increase in interest in the rv lifestyle among both older and younger segments of the population 
retail demand is the key to a sustained recovery 
while the rvia cites dealers restocking and an improving trend in rv sales to consumers  it also notes that poor employment and income growth as well as continuing credit constraints could slow the pace of the rv recovery 
in addition  commercial credit is still a significant restriction for many dealers and there is concern regarding the slowing of rv dealer restocking 
for the towable segment  retail sales as reported by statistical surveys  inc increased for the seven months ended july  compared 
table of contents with the same period in the motorized segment was down approximately 
tighter retail credit and lower consumer confidence appear to affect the motorized segment more severely 
the retail price of a towable recreation vehicle is generally less than that of a motorhome and sales of more expensive recreation vehicles have suffered greater in the recent economic downturn 
economic or industry wide factors affecting our recreation vehicle business include raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our product 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
we are starting to witness increases in the cost of our raw materials 
steel  aluminum  and thermoplastic prices have increased and there continues to be upward price pressure on several of our other raw materials 
future increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts 
historically  we have been able to pass along those price increases to consumers 
government entities are the primary users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life and are being continuously replaced by operators 
according to the mid size bus manufacturers association  unit sales of small and mid sized buses increased for the six months ended june  compared with the same period in federal stimulus funds have helped the transit industry in the recent economic downturn  however that funding is slowing down and that is expected to have a negative effect on demand for our bus products 
ridership and municipal budgets are reduced and transit agencies operating costs have increased 
this softening has slowed order input at some of our bus operations and we have reduced staff levels in certain locations 
we do not expect the current condition of the us auto industry  including the bankruptcy reorganizations of general motors and chrysler  to have a significant impact on our supply of chassis 
supply of chassis is adequate for now and we believe that available inventory would compensate for changes in supply schedules if they occur 
to date  we have not noticed any unusual cost increases from our chassis suppliers 
if the condition of the us auto industry significantly worsens  this could result in supply interruptions and a decrease in our sales and earnings while we obtain replacement chassis from other sources

corporate interest and other income was  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease is primarily the net effect of increased interest on our notes receivable of  due to higher balances and fiscal being the first full year of interest on these notes  offset by a decrease of  in interest income on our cash and investments due to lower investment balances and lower interest rates 
the overall annual effective tax rate for fiscal was on  of income before income taxes  compared to on  of income before income taxes for fiscal the primary reasons for this increase in rate were a reduced benefit in fiscal resulting from the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december  and adjustments to our income tax payable and deferred tax balances  offset by the relationship between higher pre tax income relative to certain permanent financial accounting to taxable income adjustments 
the changes in costs and price within our business due to inflation were not significantly different from inflation in the united states economy as a whole

the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 

table of contents impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets at least annually we review the carrying value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives 
long lived assets  identifiable intangibles that are amortized  goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
this review is performed primarily using estimates of future cash flows 
the market approach is also used when appropriate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair values could affect the evaluations 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator and actuary using various state statutes and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention sir for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a reserve on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data and actuarial information 
amounts above the sir  up to a certain dollar amount  are covered by our excess insurance policy 
we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of our self insured positions for products liability and personal injury matters 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the self insurance reserve was increased by  to provide for our full  sir related to an accident case arising out of our bus operations in the normal course of business 
based upon advice from outside legal counsel  we concluded that it was probable that settlement of the case would require us to pay an amount at least equal to the sir 
product warranty we generally provide retail customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate  however actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserves are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc  income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted guidance surrounding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of the implementation of this guidance  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  if any 
valuation allowances must be considered due to uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax asset on a tax jurisdictional basis based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
we have evaluated the 
table of contents sustainability of our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet which includes the assessment of the cumulative income over recent prior periods 
based on the provisions of asc  we determined a valuation allowance was not required to be recorded against deferred income tax assets in any of the tax jurisdictions in which we currently operate 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of recreation vehicles and buses are recorded primarily when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from our property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
certain shipments are sold to customers on credit or cash on delivery cod terms 
we recognize revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floor plan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments we are contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with financial institutions providing inventory financing for certain dealers of certain of our products 
these arrangements  which are customary in the industry  provide for the repurchase of products sold to dealers in the event of default by the dealer 
the repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre defined curtailment arrangements and we typically resell the repurchased product at a discount from its repurchase price 
we account for the guarantee under our repurchase agreements of our dealers financing by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation 
this deferred amount is included in our repurchase and guarantee reserve 
additionally  the repurchase and guarantee reserve includes our estimated loss upon resale of expected repurchases 
this estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting its dealers 
our risk of loss under these repurchase agreements is reduced because a we sell our products to a large number of dealers under these arrangements  b the repurchase price we are obligated to pay declines over the period of the agreements generally up to eighteen months while the value of the related product may not decline ratably and c we have historically been able to readily resell any repurchased product 
we believe that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
investments we have an investment portfolio comprised of tax exempt auction rate securities 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  auction success and failure rates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in net income which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other off balance sheet commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after years operating leases and other consigned inventory unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations we have included in unrecognized tax benefits approximately  for payments expected to be made in fiscal unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of approximately  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payment 
total amount of commitment expiration per period amounts less than other commercial commitments committed one year years years over years guarantees standby repurchase obligations total commercial commitments the standby repurchase obligations generally extend up to eighteen months from the date of sale of the related product to the dealer 
in estimating the expiration of the standby repurchase obligations  we used inventory reports as of july  from our dealers lending institutions and made an assumption for obligations for inventory aged months that it was financed evenly over the twelve month period
