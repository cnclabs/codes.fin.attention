overview through skywest airlines and asa  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and asa offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with more than  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
additionally  as of december   we provided ground handling services for approximately other airlines throughout our system 
as of december   we operated a combined fleet of aircraft consisting of crj assigned to united  assigned to delta  three assigned to midwest and two assigned to airtran  crj assigned to united and assigned to delta  crjs all assigned to delta and brasilia turboprop assigned to united and assigned to delta 
we believe our success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with our major airline partners is attributable to our delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet at a competitive cost structure 
for the year ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated under the delta code  approximately was operated under the united code  approximately was operated under the midwest code and approximately under the airtran code 
skywest airlines has been a code share partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest airlines expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest airlines expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
on june   skywest airlines and midwest mutually agreed to terminate the service skywest airlines provided to midwest under the midwest services agreement 
as a result  skywest airlines removed its remaining crjs from midwest service based on the following schedule one aircraft was removed in each of june and july  three aircraft were removed in october  two aircraft were removed in november  two aircraft were removed in december and the last three aircraft were removed in january on november   skywest airlines entered into a code share agreement with airtran 
under the terms of the code share agreement  skywest airlines has agreed to operate five crjs for airtran under a pro rate arrangement 
skywest airlines 
table of contents commenced airtran service with two aircraft in december and added three additional aircraft in january and february of the code share agreement has a three year term  however  after may   either party may terminate the agreement upon days written notice 
as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city  a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest  and a midwest connect carrier in milwaukee and an airtran carrier in milwaukee  operating more than  total daily flights 
asa has been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since as of december   asa operated as a delta connection carrier in atlanta and cincinnati 
asa operates approximately daily flights  all in the delta connection system 
we provide a substantial majority of the regional airline service for delta in atlanta and salt lake city 
in connection with our acquisition of asa in september  we established new  separate  but substantially similar  long term fixed fee delta connection agreements with delta for both skywest airlines and asa 
we also obtained the right to use gates in the hartsfield jackson international airport located in atlanta  from which we currently provide service to delta 
pursuant to the terms of the delta connection agreement executed by asa and delta  delta has also agreed that if delta solicits requests for proposals to fly delta connection regional aircraft  asa will be permitted to bid to maintain the same percentage of total delta connection regional jet flights that it operated during  and  if asa does not achieve the winning bid for the proposed flying  asa will be permitted to match the terms of the winning bid to the extent necessary for asa to maintain the same percentage of delta connection regional jet flights that it operated during on february   asa and united entered into the asa united express agreement  pursuant to which asa has agreed to operate crj aircraft as a united express carrier 
on february   asa began operating as a united express carrier  and we anticipate that the united express regional jets to be flown by asa will be in operation by may of the asa united express agreement is a capacity purchase agreement with a five year term  and other terms which are generally consistent with the skywest airlines united express agreement 
historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenues 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
for the year ended december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
for the year ended december   approximately of our crjs flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
on november   skywest airlines entered into a code share agreement with airtran 
under the terms of the code share agreement  skywest airlines has agreed to operate five crjs for airtran under a pro rate arrangement 
skywest airlines commenced airtran service with two aircraft in december and added three additional aircraft in january and february of 
table of contents financial highlights we had revenues of billion for the year ended december   a decrease  compared to revenues of billion for the year ended december  we had net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to million of net income  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the significant items affecting our financial performance during are outlined below on june   skywest airlines reached a mutual understanding with midwest to terminate the service skywest airlines provided under the midwest services agreement 
as a result  skywest airlines removed its remaining crjs from midwest service based on the following schedule one aircraft was removed in each of june and july  three aircraft were removed in october  two aircraft were removed in november  two aircraft were removed in december and the last three aircraft were removed in january additionally  skywest airlines agreed to cancel an unsecured note from midwest in the amount of approximately million in exchange for a million payment from midwest 
the million payment was recorded as revenue by skywest airlines during the three months ended december  we review our investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti with formal reviews performed quarterly 
otti losses on individual equity investment securities are recognized as a realized loss through earnings when fair value is significantly below cost  the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  and recovery is not expected in the near term 
otti losses on individual perpetual preferred securities are recognized as a realized loss through earnings when a decline in the cash flows has occurred or the rating of the security has been downgraded below investment grade 
as a result of an ongoing valuation review of our investment securities portfolio  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million during the year ended december  for certain investment securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment 
on october   delta sent letters to skywest airlines and asa requiring them to either adjust the rates payable under their respective delta connection agreements or accept termination of those agreements  and notifying skywest airlines and asa of delta s estimate of the average rates to be applied under the agreements 
on october   skywest airlines and asa notified delta of their election to adjust the rates payable under the delta connection agreements  however  they also notified delta of their disagreement with delta s estimated rates and their belief that the methodology delta used to calculate its estimated rates is inconsistent with the terms of the delta connection agreements 
skywest airlines and asa continue to negotiate with delta in an effort to determine an appropriate methodology for calculating the average rates of the carriers within the delta connection program 
because skywest airlines and asa have not reached an agreement with delta regarding the final contractual rates to be established under the delta connection agreements  the company has evaluated the dispute for calculating the average rate of the carriers within the delta connection program under the revenue recognition accounting guidance and recorded revenue under those agreements based on management s understanding of the applicable terms in the delta connection agreements and management s best estimate of the revenue that will ultimately be realized upon settlement of the contractual rates with delta with respect to the year ended december  asa experienced significant weather related cancellations in its atlanta hub during the three months ended march  additionally  on march   as a result of an internal audit  asa grounded crj regional jet aircraft in order to perform engine safety inspections in accordance with the manufacturer s recommendations 
asa cancelled approximately scheduled flights as a result of the severe weather and aircraft grounding during the quarter 
as a result  asa experienced a negative impact on revenues of approximately million 

table of contents our maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the timing of engine overhaul events 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our united express and midwest services agreements increased million 
the remainder of the increase in maintenance costs was principally due to scheduled maintenance and engine overhaul events on our aging crj and crj aircraft 
outlook on october   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which skywest airlines intends to operate for united express  as part of an aircraft transition plan 
we believe this transition plan will allow united express to remove seat brasilia turboprops from operation under the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
generally  the turboprop removals are intended to occur in conjunction with deliveries of new regional jet aircraft in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition in existing markets 
additionally  skywest airlines exchanged four seat crjs for four seat crjs in its delta connection operations 
on november   we announced that skywest airlines placed a firm order for aircraft with bombardier 
as of december   skywest airlines had taken delivery of four crjs and crjs under that order 
skywest airlines is scheduled to take delivery of the remaining four aircraft during the first quarter of on october   skywest airlines entered into a series of transactions with united that provided operational funding to united  extended skywest airlines existing rights to operate regional jet aircraft under the united express agreement until the end of their current lease terms on average years and created an opportunity for asa to operate regional jet aircraft as a united express carrier 
we anticipate that asa will begin operating as a united express carrier starting in the first quarter of  and the united express regional jets to be flown by asa will be in operation by may of we also anticipate that asa will operate these aircraft under a capacity purchase agreement with a five year term  and other terms which are generally consistent with the skywest airlines united express agreement 
also on october   skywest airlines extended to united a secured term loan in the amount of million 
the term loan bears interest at a rate of  with a ten year amortization period 
the loan is secured by certain ground equipment and airport slot rights held by united 
skywest airlines also agreed to defer certain amounts otherwise payable to skywest airlines under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
the maximum deferral amount is million and any amounts deferred accrue a deferral fee of  payable weekly 
united s right to defer such payments is scheduled to terminate in ten years 
on november   skywest airlines entered into a code share agreement with airtran 
under the terms of the code share agreement  skywest airlines has agreed to operate five crjs for airtran under a pro rate arrangement 
skywest airlines commenced airtran service with two aircraft in december and added three additional aircraft in january and february of the code share agreement has a three year term  however  after may   either party may terminate the agreement upon days written notice 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting 
table of contents policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we record that period s revenues based on the lower of prior period s approved rates adjusted for the current contract negotiations and our estimate of rates that will be implemented in accordance with revenue recognition guidelines 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the engine 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operated under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
under the terms of the vendor agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while asa s aircraft are primarily debt financed on a long term basis 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of asa 
the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether the book value of our aircraft is impaired 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
stock based compensation expense we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 
fair value we hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with united states gaap 
we determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we have valued non auction rate marketable securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if a quoted price is not available  we utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
for auction rate security instruments  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available 
as a result  we have estimated the fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow 

table of contents results of operations compared to operational statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below 
year ended december  change revenue passenger miles available seat miles asms block hours departures passengers carried passenger load factor pts revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles revenues 
operating revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
for financial reporting purposes  we record these reimbursements as operating revenue 
under the skywest airlines and asa delta connection agreements  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expenses 
we also record those engine overhaul reimbursements as operating revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements included in our passenger revenues for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
year ended december  change change passenger revenues less fuel reimbursement from major partners less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners passenger revenue excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements passenger revenues 
passenger revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in passenger revenues was primarily due to a decrease in fuel reimbursements from our major partners 
the fuel reimbursement from our major partners decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage decrease in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was more than the percentage increase in asms  primarily due to three factors 
first  asa experienced an abnormally high number of flight cancellations in part due to significant weather related cancellations in its atlanta hub during the three months ended march  additionally  on march   as a result of an internal audit  asa grounded crjs in order to perform engine safety inspections in accordance with the manufacturer s recommendations 
asa cancelled approximately scheduled flights as a result of the severe weather and aircraft grounding during the first quarter of as a 
table of contents result  asa experienced a negative impact on passenger revenues of approximately million 
second  delta transitioned ground handling services at stations from skywest airlines and asa to other ground handlers during the second quarter of revenue earned under ground handling contracts where we provide ground handling services for our own aircraft is presented in the passenger revenue line in our consolidated statements of income 
third  on october   delta sent letters to skywest airlines and asa requiring them to either adjust the rates payable under their respective delta connection agreements or accept termination of those agreements delta s letter also notified skywest airlines and asa of delta s estimate of the average rates to be applied under those agreements 
on october   skywest airlines and asa notified delta of their election to adjust the rates payable under the delta connection agreements  however  they also notified delta of their disagreement with delta s estimated rates and their belief that the methodology delta used to calculate its estimated rates is inconsistent with the terms of the delta connection agreements 
skywest airlines and asa and delta have exchanged subsequent correspondence  and skywest airlines and asa continue to negotiate with delta in an effort to determine an appropriate methodology for calculating the average rates of the carriers within the delta connection program 
because skywest airlines and asa have not reached an agreement with delta regarding the final contractual rates to be established under the delta connection agreements  the company has evaluated the method for calculating the average rate of the carriers within the delta connection program under the revenue recognition accounting guidance and recorded revenue under those agreements based on management s understanding of the applicable terms in the delta connection agreements and management s best estimate of the revenue that will ultimately be realized upon settlement of the contractual rates with delta with respect to the year ended december  ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue earned under other ground handling contracts where we provide ground handling services for other airlines is presented in the ground handling and other line in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase was primarily related to the higher volume of flights serviced under ground handling contracts with united and delta  whereby we perform ground handling services for several other regional airlines 
individual expense components for the periods indicated are expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm 
asm is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline s passenger capacity 
asms reflect both the number of aircraft in an airline s fleet and the seat capacity for the aircraft in the fleet 
as the size of our fleet is the underlying driver of our operating costs  the primary basis for our presentation in this item is on a cost per asm basis to discuss 
table of contents significant changes in our costs not proportionate to the relative changes in our fleet size dollar amounts in thousands

fuel costs decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average cost of fuel decreased to per gallon during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  in addition to the decrease in the average cost per gallon of fuel during the year ended december   united purchased fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our united express aircraft under contract operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver  midwest purchased all of the fuel for our midwest aircraft directly from midwest s fuel vendors and delta purchased the majority of the fuel for our delta aircraft under contract directly from its fuel vendors 
these modifications reduced our total fuel costs  as well as our passenger revenues for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we purchased the fuel for all of our delta connection flights 
the following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased directly  and the percentage change in fuel price per gallon on our fuel expense  for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands  except per gallon amounts change fuel gallons purchased average price per gallon fuel expense salaries wages and employee benefits 
salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in number of employees was significantly due to a reduction in our customer service employees resulting from united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of and delta transitioning stations from skywest airlines and asa to other ground handlers during the second quarter of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the

under the skywest airlines united express agreement and pursuant to the midwest services agreement prior to its termination on january   we recognize revenue in our consolidated statement of income at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines in our consolidated statement of income on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines united express and midwest services agreements increased million 
under our delta connection agreements we were reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in aircraft rents was primarily due to asa taking delivery of ten crjs during these aircraft were financed through long term leases 
this increase was partially offset by asa returning atr turboprops to the lessor and terminating the associated leases 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to our major partners paying for certain station rents and landing fees directly to the airport 
ground handling service 
ground handling service expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ground handling was primarily due to united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of and delta transitioning stations from skywest airlines and asa to other ground handlers during the second quarter of other airline expenses 
other airline expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other airline expenses was primarily due to the decrease in crew simulator training and crew hotel costs 

table of contents interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was substantially due to a decrease in interest rates 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt 
the majority of our variable rate notes are based on the three month and six month libor rates 
at december   the three month and six month libor rates were and  respectively 
at december   the three month and six month libor rates were and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was substantially due to the decrease in interest rates discussed in the preceding paragraph 
total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest  skywest airlines and asa delta connection agreements  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue

impairment of marketable securities 
as a result of an ongoing valuation review of our marketable securities portfolio  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million during the year ended december  for certain marketable securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment 
other income 
during the year ended december   we negotiated the principal terms of a prospective capacity purchase agreement with continental  which was intended to become effective if we had successfully completed our proposed acquisition of the outstanding shares of capital stock of expressjet 
during the course of those negotiations  continental agreed it would pay us a break up fee under certain circumstances in the event our efforts to acquire expressjet were not successful 
in june  expressjet reached terms directly with continental on a new capacity purchase agreement  and accordingly  we were precluded from completing the acquisition of expressjet 
as a result  we received 
table of contents the break up fee from continental in june the break up fee  net of our direct transaction costs  was million pre tax and was recorded as other income during the year ended december  income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased to in from in the lower rate includes the impact of a decrease to the effective state income tax rate as the result of state tax law changes in utah and other states 
the state effective tax rate also decreased slightly from to minimizing the increase of the effective tax rate from to net income 
primarily due to factors described above  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared to operational statistics

skywest airlines subsequently reached agreement with midwest to reduce the number of aircraft operating under the midwest services agreement from aircraft to aircraft 
as part of the modified agreement  skywest airlines agreed to defer a portion of midwest s weekly payment obligations from july  through november  the amount skywest airlines agreed to defer  plus certain amounts midwest owed skywest airlines at june   were initially scheduled for repayment starting on august   however  in june  skywest airlines and midwest reached a mutual understanding to terminate the midwest services agreement  remove the remaining skywest airlines aircraft from midwest service and further restructure midwest s payment obligation to skywest airlines skywest airlines agreed to cancel an unsecured note from midwest in the amount of approximately million in exchange for a million payment from midwest that is guaranteed by republic airways holdings  inc the unsecured note related to certain deferred payments midwest owed skywest airlines from services provided under the midwest services agreement

fuel costs increased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  the increase in the average cost per gallon during the year ended december  was mitigated by united purchasing fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our united express aircraft operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver 
midwest also purchased all of its fuel directly from fuel vendors  which reduced our total fuel costs and related passenger revenue

as of december   we operated a total of brasilia turboprops under separate pro rate agreements with delta and united 
during the year ended december   the cost of fuel associated with the pro rate operations increased approximately million pre tax compared to the year ended december  salaries wages and employee benefits 
salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in number of employees was significantly due to delta assuming responsibility from asa in june for the performance of customer service functions in atlanta and united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the timing of engine overhaul events 
our engine overhaul expense increased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the majority of the engine overhauls related to aircraft operated under our delta connection agreements and we were reimbursed for such engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in maintenance excluding engine overhaul costs was principally due to other scheduled maintenance events on our aging crj and crj aircraft and repairs incurred on aircraft damaged during the normal course of business 
additionally  since december   we added four used crjs and two used crjs to our fleet 
compared to new aircraft  used aircraft typically experience higher maintenance costs during the first year of service 
under the skywest airlines united express and midwest services agreements  we recognized revenue in our consolidated statement of income at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines in our consolidated statement of income on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
during the year ended december  our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines united express and midwest services agreements increased million 
under our delta connection agreements we were reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in aircraft rentals was primarily due to the addition of two used crjs that were financed through long term leases 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the addition of four crj and three crjs that were financed using long term debt 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our station rentals and landing fee costs can be impacted based upon the volume of passengers carried and the number of departures 
the decrease in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to a decrease in passengers carried and a decrease in departures during the year ended december  ground handling service 
ground handling service expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ground handling was due primarily to delta assuming responsibility from asa in june for the performance of customer service functions in atlanta and united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of other expenses 
other expense  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other expenses was primarily due to the decrease in crew simulator training and crew hotel costs 
these decreases were due primarily to fewer training events in  primarily caused by lower production such as a decrease of in departures during the year ended december  interest 
interest expense decreased million  or during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was substantially due to a decrease in interest rates 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt 
the majority of our variable rate notes are based on the three month and six month libor rates 
at december   the three month and six month libor rates were and  respectively 
at december   the three month and six month libor rates were and  respectively 
total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest  skywest airlines and asa delta connection agreements  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of 
table of contents fuel and engine overhaul expenses which are included in our total airline expenses for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change total airline expense less fuel expense less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners total airline expense excluding fuel and engine overhauls excluding fuel and engine overhaul costs  our total airline expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage decrease in total airline expenses excluding fuel and engine overhauls  was less than the percentage decrease in asms  which is primarily due to increases in non engine overhaul maintenance expenses attributable to the increased age of our fleet 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased to in from in the lower rate includes the impact of a decrease to the effective state income tax rate as the result of state tax law changes in utah and other states 
the impact of the decreased effective tax rate was partially offset by the decrease in tax exempt interest income in from net income 
primarily due to the factors described above  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the decrease was principally attributable to million we loaned to united in october we also agreed to defer million otherwise payable to skywest airlines under the skywest airlines united express agreement  offset by cash generated from operating activities 
the principal sources of cash during the year ended december  were million provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  million from the sale of property and equipment  million from returns on aircraft deposits  million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and million from repayment of the united note receivable 
we invested million in marketable securities  invested million in flight equipment  made principal payments on long term debt of million  repurchased million of outstanding shares of our common stock  invested million in buildings and ground equipment  paid million in cash dividends  invested million in other assets and issued a note receivable of million to united 
these factors resulted in a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  our position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in marketable securities was due primarily to cash generated from operations in that was invested in marketable securities 

table of contents at december   our total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  as of december   skywest airlines had a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility expires on march  and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million as restricted cash  related to our workers compensation policies 
significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations interest commitments principal maturities on long term debt total commitments and obligations purchase commitments and options on october   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which skywest airlines has placed into operation under the skywest airlines united express agreement as part of an aircraft transition plan  allowing united to remove seat brasilia turboprops from the contract reimbursement model contemplated by the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
additionally  skywest airlines exchanged four crjs for four crjs in its delta connection operations 
these four seat crjs were placed into service under other capacity purchase agreements 
in november  skywest airlines placed a firm order with bombardier for the new aircraft 
as of december   skywest airlines had taken delivery of four crjs and crjs pursuant to that order 
skywest airlines is scheduled to take delivery of the remaining four aircraft during the first quarter of total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations  are estimated to be approximately million through the first quarter of additionally  skywest airlines agreement with bombardier includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
delivery dates for these aircraft remain subject to final determination as skywest airlines agrees upon with its major partners 
we have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long term debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing 
table of contents alternatives available to us  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing cannot be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has typically financed our aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to satisfy our firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as our acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
nonetheless  recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility  decreased liquidity and limited availability of capital  and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary funding or that  if we are able to obtain necessary capital  the corresponding terms will be favorable or acceptable to us 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  long term debt obligations as of december   we had  million of long term debt obligations related to the acquisition of brasilia turboprop  crj  crj and crj aircraft 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the brasilia turboprop and crj aircraft was approximately at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the obligations of asa under the asa delta connection agreement

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted united express flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our pro rate operations 
for the year ended december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements while  approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements and approximately of our crjs flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
as of december   we operated crj s under a pro rate agreement with united and two crjs with airtran 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel on our pro rate operations using a hypothetical increase of in the price per gallon we purchase 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in fuel expense for the year ended december  interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  however  under our contractual arrangement with our major partners  the majority of the increase in interest expense would be passed through and recorded as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
also for illustrative purposes only  we have likewise estimated the impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based upon this hypothetical example  we would have recognized million less in interest expense and received less in interest income for the year ended december   and we would have recognized million less in interest expense and received less in interest income for the year ended december  if interest rates were to decline  our major partners would receive the principal benefit of the decline  since interest expense is generally passed through to our major partners  resulting in a reduction to passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact our actual costs of acquiring these aircraft 

table of contents auction rate securities we have investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
due primarily to instability in credit markets over the past two years  we sold a portion of these investments 
as of december   we had investments valued at a total of million which were classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheet
