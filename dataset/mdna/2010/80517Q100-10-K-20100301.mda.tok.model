item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing krystexxa pegloticase for the treatment of chronic gout in patients refractory to conventional therapy 
chronic gout that is refractory to conventional therapy occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these drugs are contraindicated 
krystexxa is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia 
based on the progress we have made to date  we believe that we will file our bla resubmission for krystexxa in march our strategic plan is to seek approval from the fda of our bla filing for krystexxa and to develop a program of regulatory filings and review of krystexxa in other countries 
we continue to believe that a worldwide partnership for the commercialization of krystexxa or broader strategic transaction involving our company would serve to maximize the commercial prospects of krystexxa in the united states  europe and other foreign countries 
if we are not able to consummate a worldwide partnership or broader strategic transaction on terms acceptable to us  we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states 
currently  we sell and distribute branded and generic versions of oxandrolone  a drug used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we launched our authorized generic version of oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to oxandrin 
the introduction of oxandrolone generics has led to significant decreases in demand for oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
we believe that revenues from oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone will remain flat or continue to decrease in future periods 
we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment  which includes sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone and the research and development activities of krystexxa 
discontinued operations in august  we sold rosemont pharmaceuticals  ltd  or rosemont  our former united kingdom subsidiary that marketed more than oral liquid pharmaceuticals in the united kingdom  europe and part of asia  to ingleby limited  a close brothers private equity company  or close brothers 
under the terms of the sale  close brothers paid us an aggregate purchase price of million for the issued share capital of rosemont s parent company and certain other related assets 
net proceeds from the transaction after selling costs and taxes were million 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the disposition of rosemont in in july  we sold btg  a biologics manufacturing business which primarily operates in israel  to ferring 
under the terms of the sale  ferring paid us an aggregate purchase price of million in cash and assumed specified liabilities related to the btg business 
we recorded a loss of  on the disposition of the btg business in revenue  operating income and income loss from discontinued operations  which consisted of the rosemont and btg businesses  for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december   we incurred a million tax assessment as a result of a tax audit for the through tax years that related to corporate income tax returns filed in israel by btg 
discontinued operations for include tax refunds related to btg that we received from the israel taxing authorities and foreign currency exchange gains on these refunds 
the tax refund was due to an overpayment of estimated taxes in israel for the short tax year 
we did not have any revenues or operating income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and these results of discontinued operations are not included in the discussion below under results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies include management estimates that are most critical to our reported financial results research and development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  stock based compensation  and costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials 
manufacturing costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors for validation batch production  process technology transfer  quality control and stability testing  raw material purchases  overhead expenses and facilities costs 
we expense these manufacturing related expenses as research and development as incurred because these costs do not meet the definition of an asset  as future use cannot be determined based upon the uncertainty of whether krystexxa will be approved for marketing by the fda 
clinical trial costs are another significant component of research and development expenses and most of our clinical studies are performed by third party cros 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros that are milestone or event driven in nature and based on reports and invoices submitted by the cro 
these expenses are based on patient enrollment as well as costs consisting primarily of payments made to the cro  clinical sites  investigators  testing facilities and patients for participating in our clinical trials 
non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
consistent with the consensus  we have deferred approximately and million of these costs as of december  and  respectively  and have amortized approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  based on services performed 
the net deferred balance of and million as of december  and  respectively  is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
all other research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred  including million and million of fees incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  to reserve manufacturing capacity at our third party suppliers manufacturing facilities  for future potential orders of krystexxa 
share based compensation 
we have share based compensation plans in place and record the associated stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period 
the share based compensation plans are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost for stock options that contain service conditions is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards that contain service conditions as of the grant date by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
in addition  as future grants are made  we expect to incur additional compensation costs 
restricted stock awards that contain service conditions are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense  on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from one to four years in duration 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards that contain service conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation cost for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance or market conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
compensation expense is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest 
for purposes of recording compensation expense  we consider performance conditions that depend on a change in control event or an fda approval  once the transaction is consummated or the event occurs 
previously recognized compensation expense is fully reversed if performance targets are not satisfied 
we assess the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis and record compensation expense from that date  over the remainder of the requisite service period 
we grant stock options that contain service conditions to employees and directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock on the date that the options are granted 
options granted have a term of years from the grant date 
options granted to employees vest over a four year period and options granted to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period  from the date of grant 
options to directors are granted on an annual basis and represent compensation for service performance on the board of directors 
compensation cost for stock options is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards at the closing price on the grant date by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
during the years ended december   and  we issued  shares   shares  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and received proceeds of million  million  and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized no tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of stock option compensation cost has been charged against income 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unamortized stock option compensation which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of related to stock option awards to senior management personnel that contain performance or market conditions  the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain specific strategic objectives by december   including fda marketing approval of krystexxa and other business development objectives 
at december   approximately  potential option shares with performance or market conditions remain unvested 
stock option awards with performance or market conditions encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through the end of and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be achieved 
we grant restricted stock awards that contain service conditions to our employees and to our directors 
restricted stock awards are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense  on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from one to four years in duration 
restricted stock awards to directors are granted on a yearly basis and represent compensation for services performed on the board of directors 
restricted stock awards to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period from the grant date 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards that contain service conditions is based on the award s grant date fair value  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of restricted stock at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share amounting to million in total aggregate fair market value 
during the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred restricted stock compensation cost has been charged against income 
at december   approximately  shares remained unvested and there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that contain service conditions 
during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of related to restricted stock awards to senior management personnel that contain performance or market conditions the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain specific strategic objectives by december   including fda marketing approval of krystexxa and other business development objectives 
at december   approximately  potential shares of restricted stock awards with performance or market conditions remain unvested  and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be achieved 
during  we reversed approximately million of compensation expense that was previously charged against income and for the year ended december   million of compensation cost was charged against income related to restricted stock awards issued in previous years that contain performance or market conditions 
at december   approximately  potential shares of these restricted stock awards issued in previous years with performance or market conditions remain unvested 
restricted stock awards with performance conditions issued in previous years encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be achieved 
during the year ended december   we issued a restricted stock award to our former president and chief executive officer  the vesting of which was contingent upon the price of our common stock achieving a certain pre established stock price target 
we used a monte carlo simulation model to calculate both the grant date fair value and the derived requisite service period of the award 
based on the simulation  the grant date fair value of the award was calculated to be per share and compensation cost was being charged against income ratably over a two year derived requisite service period 
for restricted stock awards that contain market conditions  compensation cost is charged against income regardless of whether the market condition is ever achieved and is reversed only if the derived requisite service period is not met by the recipient of the award 
as a result of the resignation of employment of our former president and chief executive officer in november  the derived requisite service period for this award was not met  and therefore  we reversed in  million of compensation expense that was previously charged against income during and income taxes 
in  we generated a net operating loss of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this benefit reflects the expected tax effect of carrying back an increased portion of our alternative minimum tax net operating loss to our and tax years to recover the remaining alternative minimum income tax liability of million that is eligible to be refunded for those tax years  as well as a million benefit due to a reversal of a liability for unrecognized tax benefit caused by a lapse in statute 
the opportunity for carryback became available due to section b h and b of the internal revenue code which was amended under section of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of a refund of million was received in february of relating to this income tax benefit 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carry forwards  we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified 
we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature 
weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles 
less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature 
in  based on the net operating loss generated in and historical losses and the uncertainty of profitability in the near future  we concluded that we would maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets except those assets that are reserved by a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we maintained a valuation allowance as of december  of million 
the increase in valuation allowance from compared to of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits and the uncertainty that these additional deferred tax assets will be realized 
we use judgment in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax positions 
additional provisions for income taxes are established when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
we are examined by federal and state tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption of the new accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainties in income taxes as codified under fasb asc  income taxes  resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
disclosures about fair values of financial instruments 
we adopted a new accounting standard that defines fair value and establishes a framework for fair value measurements effective january  for financial assets and liabilities and effective january  for non financial assets and liabilities that are not re measured on a recurring basis 
under this standard  fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability or exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we categorize our financial instruments into a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
if the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument 
financial assets recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset 
level inputs include the following quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non active markets  inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
they reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset 
during the three months ended june   we adopted two new accounting standards that require disclosures at each interim balance sheet date of the fair value of financial instruments and valuation techniques used to determine fair value 
previously  these disclosures were only required annually 
one of these accounting standards also provides additional guidance in estimating fair value when the market volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction may not be orderly 
the adoption of these two accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value of financial instruments 
other than temporary impairment losses on investments 
we regularly monitor our available for sale portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary  or ott  decreases in the fair value of investments 
during the three months ended june   we adopted a new accounting standard that modifies the guidance used in determining whether the impairment of a debt security is ott 
the impairment of a debt security is considered ott if an entity concludes that it intends to sell the impaired security  that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its cost basis or that it does not otherwise expect to recover the entire cost basis of the security 
this accounting standard also amends the presentation requirements of ott impaired debt securities and expands disclosure requirements in the financial statements for investments in both debt and equity securities 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
management makes determinations relating to recording impairment losses for ott through the consideration of various factors such as management s intent to sell an investment before the recovery of its cost basis 
ott impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the investment 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded  million and million  respectively  of realized investment losses due to ott declines in fair value 
product revenue recognition 
product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
we ship our authorized generic oxandrolone to our distributor and account for these shipments on a consignment basis until product is sold into the retail market 
we defer the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product is recognized at the time of sale only if i the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  ii the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  iii the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  iv the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  v the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to or up to months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known or knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
the aggregate net product return allowance reserve was million as of december   and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowance for product returns is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for sales returns allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the aggregate net rebate accrual balances were million as of december  and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowances for medicaid and other government rebates is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for rebates inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on actual cost 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
we continually analyze the impact of generic competition on our inventory reserves considering the oxandrin inventory currently on hand  inclusive of raw materials and finished goods  and the current demand forecasts 
the aggregate net inventory valuation reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
results of operations during  and  we incurred substantial expenses relating to the clinical development of krystexxa 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses in  as we anticipate continued substantial expenses relating to the development and  if approved  the commercialization of krystexxa 
our expenses relating to the development and commercialization of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements relating to the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states and internationally 
during  the expenses associated with our regulatory  clinical  manufacturing and commercial development of krystexxa were the most significant factors affecting our results of operations 
the following table summarizes our cost of expenses and indicates the significance of research and development costs related to our development of krystexxa as well as percentage of total cost of expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses our revenues for  and were derived primarily from oxandrin and oxandrolone 
our product revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including increased competition from new or existing products  including generic products  the amount and timing of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments to licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the timing and amount of expenses relating to sales and marketing  the timing and amount of expenses relating to general and administrative activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions 
our future revenues depend on our success in completing development and commercialization of krystexxa 
the commercial success of krystexxa will depend on many factors including receiving  and the timing of  marketing approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities  receiving fda and other foreign regulatory approvals of the third party manufacturing facilities used to produce the active pharmaceutical and other ingredients used in krystexxa  as well as for facilities used by our third party fill and finish provider  successful completion of the ole and re exposure studies and any other clinical trials we may undertake  producing batches of pegloticase api drug substance and other ingredients used in krystexxa in commercial quantities through a validated process  maintaining and  as appropriate  entering into additional  commercial manufacturing arrangements for krystexxa  launching commercial sales of the product  whether alone or in collaboration with others  acceptance of krystexxa by physicians  patients  healthcare payors and others in the medical community  and  our ability to raise substantial additional capital 
the following table summarizes net product sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of total net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands oxandrin oxandrolone our financial results have been dependent on sales of oxandrin since its launch in december generic competition for oxandrin began in december and the introduction of generic products has caused a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which has adversely affected us financially and has required us to scale back some of our business activities related to the product 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a much less significant product for our future operating results 
in september  we completed a plan of termination pursuant to which we reduced our workforce by employees 
this termination was in addition to a previous termination of nine employees in august in connection with the plan of termination  we incurred charges of million 
we recorded million in severance related expenses during the quarter ended september  and an additional million of stock based compensation expense during the quarter ended december   as a result of modifications to stock option awards previously granted to the terminated employees 
the modifications included extending the term of exercisability of the vested portion of the stock options from three months following cessation of employment to six months following cessation of employment  coupled with accelerating the vesting to immediately vest any unvested stock options 
the severance related expenses resulted in cash expenditures of million during the quarter ended december  and will result in an additional million in cash expenditures during the first half of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower net product sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
gross sales of oxandrin decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease is due to lower overall demand for the product as a result of increase generic competition 
net sales of oxandrin were flat as compared to the prior year due to higher prior year experience adjustments relating to reserves for product returns and government and customer rebates 
oxandrolone net sales were lower by million  or  to million in  from million in we expect that sales of oxandrin will remain flat or continue to decline in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to an increase in gross sales of our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to million in lower manufacturing related expenses including million of decreased technology transfer expenses at diosynth as the majority of the work was completed in the prior year 
partially offsetting the lower technology transfer expenses were higher costs of million for commercial batch production at btg 
the decrease in research and development expenses was also due to million in lower clinical studies and research as a result of the wind down of the ole study in coupled with a toxicology study performed in the prior year 
additionally  we incurred million in lower compensation expenses due to decreased headcount resulting from the plan of termination implemented in september and million of lower consulting  medical writing and data management services associated with the preparation of our bla filing for krystexxa 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in severance costs related to the plan of termination in september and other terminated employees during if and when our bla for krystexxa is approved by the fda  we will no longer record manufacturing related costs for krystexxa as research and development expenses and will instead capitalize those costs as inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses as a result of our patent infringement litigation with upsher smith laboratories  or upsher smith  and the settlement of a lawsuit with a former executive relating to his entitlement to severance payments and benefits upon termination of his employment  both occurring in additionally  marketing expenses for the preparation of the commercial launch of krystexxa decreased by approximately million as these expenses wound down as a result of the previous expectation and preparation for a commercial launch in september investment income investment income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in dividend and interest income driven by lower average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances and as a result of lower yields earned on these investments due to a change in the investment strategy focused on capital retention 
we expect these lower yields on investments to continue over the next months 
other expense  net other expense  net increased million primarily as a result of the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability in the current year of million  to record a loss due to the appreciation in fair market value of our warrants as a result of a higher underlying common stock price since the date of issuance of the warrants 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million  to a benefit of million in  from a benefit of million in the income tax benefit reflects the expected tax effect of carrying back an increased portion of our alternative minimum tax net operating loss to our and tax years to recover the remaining alternative minimum income tax liability of million that is eligible to be refunded for those tax years  as well as a million benefit due to a reversal of a liability for unrecognized tax benefit caused by a lapse in statute 
the opportunity for carry back became available due to section b h and b of the internal revenue code which was amended under section of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
we expect that sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone will remain flat or continue to decrease in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition 
we recorded oxandrin negative net product sales of million for the year ended december   compared with million of net product sales for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower gross sales as a result of increased generic competition and an increase in our allowance for product returns due to higher actual historical rates of return for the product 
revenues from oxandrolone decreased million  or  to million in  from million in due to increased generic competition 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold remained unchanged at million in both and our cost of goods sold did not vary significantly from period to period 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was mainly due to a million increase in manufacturing related expenses for the completion of the first commercial batches of krystexxa and from the process validation and technology transfer to our secondary source supplier of pegloticase api drug substance 
the increase in expenses was also due to million in higher consulting  medical writing and data management services associated with the preparation of our bla filing for krystexxa  million in higher compensation expenses due to increased headcount and service based restricted stock awards  million from toxicology expenses and other clinical research studies for krystexxa and a million license milestone payment resulting from the filing of our bla in october partially offsetting these increases was an million decrease in clinical trial expenses as our phase clinical trials for krystexxa were completed in late if and when our bla for krystexxa is approved by the fda  we will no longer record manufacturing related costs for krystexxa as research and development expenses and will instead capitalize those costs as inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in legal expenses as a result of our patent infringement litigation with upsher smith laboratories  or upsher smith  and the settlement of a lawsuit with a former executive relating to his entitlement to severance payments and benefits upon termination of his employment 
additionally  marketing expenses for the preparation of a possible commercial launch of krystexxa increased by approximately million 
also contributing to the increase was approximately million in accrued severance expenses related to the separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer 
partially offsetting the increases was the reversal of million in stock based compensation expense that was previously charged against income related to a restricted stock award that contained a market condition for which the derived service period was not met  as a result of the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
also contributing to the offset was a decrease of approximately million in audit fees and million in decreased bonuses for senior executives 
investment income investment income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was due to decreases in dividend and interest income driven by lower cash  cash equivalent and investment balances in addition to lower yields earned on these investments 
the decrease is also attributable to approximately million of realized losses resulting from redemptions and impairment write downs on our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  or the portfolio  during income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million  to a benefit of million in  from a benefit of million in the income tax benefit reflects the expected tax effect of carrying back a portion of our net operating loss to our tax year to recover the remaining income tax liability that is eligible to be refunded for that tax year and the reversal of a deferred tax benefit related to a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit 
the decrease in the tax benefit from resulted from having significantly less taxes available to be refunded as a result of carrying back net operating losses than were available to be refunded as a result of carrying back net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december  we primarily invest our cash equivalents and short term investments in highly liquid  interest bearing  us treasury money market funds in order to preserve principal 
our strategic plan is to seek approval from the fda of krystexxa and to develop a program of regulatory filings and review of krystexxa in other countries 
we continue to believe that a worldwide partnership for the commercialization of krystexxa or a broader strategic transaction involving our company would serve to maximize the commercial prospects of krystexxa in the united states  europe and other foreign countries 
if we are not able to consummate a worldwide partnership or broader strategic transaction on terms acceptable to us  we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states 
based on our current strategic plan  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations without krystexxa approval for at least the next months 
however  if we independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations for at least the next months 
in addition  in light of the fda s july  crl to our krystexxa bla  we are continuing to engage in an active effort to reassess our expenditures and align our cash outlays more closely with the fda approval process to conserve cash 
on april   we raised million from a registered direct offering  which yielded approximately million in cash net of approximately million of offering costs  which were charged to additional paid in capital 
we issued  shares of our common stock to existing and new institutional investors as part of the offering 
the investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance and expire on november  we may  at our or the warrant holder s election  issue net shares in lieu of a cash payment of the exercise price by the warrant holder upon exercise 
in the event that we enter into a merger or change of control transaction  the holders of the warrants will be entitled to receive consideration as if they had exercised the warrant immediately prior to such transaction  or they may require us to purchase the warrant at the black scholes value at the time of such transaction 
in june  we received a us federal income tax refund of approximately million which was previously reflected in recoverable income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the refund is the result of the carry back of our federal net operating losses against taxable income 
in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
we are using the net proceeds to complete our ongoing development effort to seek fda approval of krystexxa  to develop a program of regulatory filings and review of krystexxa in other countries  to engage a global secondary source supplier and a secondary fill and finish manufacturer for krystexxa and for working capital and other general corporate purposes as a result of the deficiencies cited by the fda concerning our bla filed for krystexxa and our decision to revert to the phase manufacturing process  launch quantity finished product batches previously manufactured will not be available for commercial distribution 
therefore  except for portions of these batches being utilized for stability and other analytical testing  the remaining quantities of this finished product were destroyed 
we believe we may incur approximately million of cash outlays in the future to replace these launch quantities of finished product 
the costs for these finished product batches were expensed as incurred as research and development expenses within our consolidated statements of operations when the batches were manufactured 
tax benefits as of december   we had a net operating loss for federal income taxes of million 
we currently don t benefit from this net operating loss as we will carry forward these losses until we become profitable 
in february  we received an additional million refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years 
the recovery in february of prior alternative minimum income taxes is the result of an amendment of section b h and b of the internal revenue code which was amended under section of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of cash flows cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflects our net loss for the period of million partially offset by million in cash received from our us federal income tax refund as a result of the carry back of our federal net operating losses against taxable income and a non cash charge of million as a result of the mark to market valuation of our warrant liability 
we received million from investment activities resulting primarily from the full liquidation of our investment in the portfolio  in the proceeds from the redemptions were re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
we also received million in cash from financing activities  million resulting from net proceeds from our registered direct offering in april  million resulting from net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock in october  and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily due to the exercise of stock options 
for the year ended december   we used net cash of million in operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  offset in part by million of federal income tax benefits realized and million of non cash stock compensation expense 
we received million from investment activities resulting primarily from redemptions of our investment in the portfolio 
the proceeds from the redemptions were re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
in november  we used million in cash to purchase an investment in the portfolio  which is classified on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted short term and long term investments 
in december  columbia management  or columbia  a unit of bank of america  or boa  closed the portfolio to new investments and redemptions and began an orderly liquidation and dissolution of the portfolio s assets for distribution to the unit holders  thereby restricting our potential to invest in and withdraw from the portfolio 
as of december   approximately million  or  of our original million investment has been redeemed and re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
at december   the fair market value of restricted investment securities was million  million of which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of short term investments and million of which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of long term other assets 
during  the remaining million of this investment was redeemed and re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
funding requirements our strategic plan is to seek approval from the fda of krystexxa and to develop a program of regulatory filings and review of krystexxa in other countries 
we continue to believe that a worldwide partnership for the commercialization of krystexxa or a broader strategic transaction involving our company would serve to maximize the commercial prospects of krystexxa in the united states  europe and other foreign countries 
if we are not able to consummate a worldwide partnership or broader strategic transaction on terms acceptable to us  we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements relating to the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states and internationally 
if the fda does not approve or materially delays approval of our bla for krystexxa  or if we are not successful in consummating a worldwide partnership for the commercialization of krystexxa or a broader strategic transaction involving our company  our cash needs will increase  and we may need to seek additional funding 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding may not be on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we issue preferred stock  it would likely include a liquidation preference and other terms that would adversely affect our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  we may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to take specified actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
if additional funds are not available on favorable terms  or at all  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  and we may be required to curtail or cease operations 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitment obligations other commitments total purchase commitment obligations represent our contractually obligated minimum purchase requirements based on our current manufacturing and supply and other agreements in place with third parties 
the table does not include potential future purchase commitments for which the amounts and timing of payments cannot be reasonably predicted 
other commitments represent obligations related to potential developmental milestone payments and other commitments that we believe are probable to occur during the krystexxa research and development process up through and including regulatory submission 
developmental and sales based milestone payments that occur upon or subsequent to regulatory approval have not been included in the table due to the uncertainty of achieving regulatory approval 
in the event that krystexxa receives regulatory approval  the resulting milestone payment obligation would be approximately million 
if we successfully commercialize krystexxa and achieve certain sales levels  sales based milestone payments could reach approximately million 
other commitments also includes accrued severance costs related to general release and separation agreements with our former president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief medical officer  the head of quality and regulatory affairs and other employees whose service was terminated during the table does not include potential future payment obligations  including uncertain tax liabilities  for which the amounts and timing of payments cannot be reasonably predicted 
we have received financial grants in support of research and development from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel  or ocs  and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation  or bird  of approximately million and million  respectively for the development of krystexxa 
these grants are subject to repayment through royalties on the commercial sales of krystexxa if and when they commence 
the ocs grants were received by our former subsidiary  btg  and upon our divestiture of btg to ferring  we agreed to remain obligated to reimburse btg for its repayments to ocs that relate to the krystexxa financial grants 
in addition  under the israeli law of encouragement of research and development in industry  as amended  as a result of the funding received from ocs  if we do not manufacture of our krystexxa annual worldwide bulk product requirements in israel  we may be subject to total payments ranging from to of the repayment obligation plus interest  based upon the percentage of manufacturing that does not occur in israel 
our aggregate principle repayment obligation plus interest to ocs and bird if we successfully launch krystexxa and  as per our agreements with btg and diosynth  manufacture more that of our annual worldwide bulk product requirements outside of israel  would range between million and million at december  these payments have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulatory approval and commercialization of krystexxa 
we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  we don t believe any of this liability will be paid within the next months and are unable to estimate the amount or the timing of payments  if any  relating to this liability 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
accounting pronouncements adopted in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu amends asu to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the amended guidance requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers  the reasons for any transfers in or out of level  and information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
the asu also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
the amended guidance is effective for interim and annual financial periods beginning after december  asu is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  measuring liabilities at fair value 
fasb asu provides amendments to fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
fasb asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fasb asc the amendments in the update also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
the amendments in the update also clarify that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the guidance provided in fasb asu is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
the adoption of fasb asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting statement on accounting standards codification 
the new statement establishes fasb accounting standards codification  or codification  as the single source of authoritative non governmental gaap and is codified under fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification does not change current gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the codification will be considered non authoritative 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification is for disclosure only and did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued a new accounting statement on subsequent events as codified under fasb asc  subsequent events 
the new statement establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the new statement requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date and should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
the new statement shall be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events not addressed in other applicable gaap 
other applicable gaap may address the accounting treatment of events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued 
if an event or transaction is within the scope of other applicable gaap  then an entity shall follow the guidance in that applicable gaap  rather than the guidance in the new statement 
the new statement is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and is applied prospectively 
the adoption of the new statement did not have a material effect on our recognition or disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate all subsequent events as of the issuance date of our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly as codified under fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the guidance provides additional options for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the guidance addresses the recommendations of specific issues in the securities and exchange commission s  or sec s  study on mark to market accounting and provides additional guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  and shall be applied prospectively 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as codified under fasb asc  financial instruments 
the guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements

the guidance amends the ott impairment guidance in gaap for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and improves the presentation and disclosure of ott impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
the guidance does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to ott impairments of equity securities 
the guidance expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about ott impairments for debt and equity securities and requires a more detailed  risk oriented breakdown by major security types and related information 
in addition  the guidance requires that the annual disclosures in existing gaap related to ott impairments of equity securities be made for interim periods 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  early adoption for periods ending before march   is not permitted 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

the guidance delayed the effective date to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis and at least annually 
since we do not carry any non financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis  the conclusion of the deferral period did not have an effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainties in income taxes as codified under fasb asc  income taxes 
the guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the guidance also provides clarity on de recognition of tax benefits  classification on the consolidated balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted this guidance effective january  and as a result  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this increase in liability resulted in a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations
