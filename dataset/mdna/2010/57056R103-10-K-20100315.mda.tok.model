item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the impact of seasonality and cyclicality  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of the extent to which our business is seasonal 
employees as of december   we had employees located at our corporate headquarters in kirkland  washington 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced employment related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good

on the investor relations financial information section of our web site  we provide free access to our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 
the information found on our web site is not a part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec 
in addition  our filings are available at the sec s web site www 
sec 
gov and at the sec s public reference room at f street  ne  washington  dc  or by calling sec item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition  as well as other information included in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline 
we have reported net losses for the past four years 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenues are unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in rates of customer acquisition and retention  the cyclical nature of the real estate industry  and other factors outside of our control 
in addition  our expenses and revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to  among other factors  the timing of sales and marketing campaigns 
our reported net losses have included significant impairment charges due in part to the decline in our business and our lower market capitalization 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our past operating results may not be good indicators of our future performance and should not be relied on to predict the future performance of our stock price 
it is possible that in the future our operating results will not meet the expectations of investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  companies that have experienced decreases in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
a securities class action lawsuit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns 

table of contents our operating results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
our business is dependent on the health of the residential real estate industry 
the residential real estate market historically has been subject to economic cycles 
an economic slowdown or recession  adverse tax policies  lower availability of credit  increased interest rates  or other factors that impact consumer confidence could decrease demand for residential real estate 
for example  our revenues have declined over the past three years due in part to the national downturn in the real estate industry  including a decrease in the number of real estate professionals  and the economic slowdown 
trends in the real estate industry are unpredictable  therefore  our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader real estate industry  may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and expect that competition will continue to be intense 
the barriers to entry in our industry are low  making it possible for current or new competitors to adopt certain aspects of our business model without great financial expense  thereby reducing our ability to differentiate our services 
all of our services  including online lead generation  online prospect management  online real estate portal content and advertising  and customer coaching and training  are provided in part or in combination by other companies 
one or more of these companies  or a new market entrant  could adopt a business model that competes directly with us  which could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
see item business competition for a discussion of our competitors 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  greater technological capabilities or greater financial  sales  marketing and human resources than we do 
these competitors could do any of the following  which could adversely impact our business and operating results develop services that are as effective as or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than do our services  devote greater resources to marketing or selling their services  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees or independent contractors than we do  more effectively negotiate third party arrangements  and take advantage of investments  acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than we can 
any efforts to expand into new lines of business and offer new products may not be successful  or may take longer than expected to complete 
new initiatives we may pursue may not be successful or the anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected 
also  we may have little or no experience in these areas which may result in errors in the conception  structure or implementation of a strategy to take advantage of available opportunities 
we cannot assure you that any new products or other expansion efforts will be successful 
any failure to increase the number of our customers would harm our business 
growth of our business depends in large part on increasing the number of our customers 
however  prospective customers may not be familiar with our services and may be accustomed to using traditional methods of advertising and marketing 
to attract more customers  we must convince real estate professionals to spend a portion of their advertising and marketing budgets on our services 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to acquire customers or that we will be able to acquire them at the same rate that we have historically 
if we reach the point at which we have attempted to sell our services to the majority of 
table of contents residential real estate professionals  our ability to further increase the number of customers could be limited 
we may not know or be able to estimate when we have reached this point because we currently cannot reliably estimate the total number of residential real estate professionals that are actively engaged in the industry during any particular period and media reports indicate that the total number of real estate professionals are expected to decline because of the ongoing negative trends in the real estate industry 
any failure to retain customers could harm our business 
our ability to retain our customers will depend on our ability to generate web site traffic and leads from prospective home buyers and sellers in quantities demanded by our customers  to enhance our existing services  develop new technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of customers  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis 
if we do not deliver the web site traffic or quantity and quality of leads expected by our customers  maintain adequate technical support levels  or continue to improve the ease of use  functionality and features of our prospect management systems  customer coaching and training offerings  or if customers are dissatisfied with the quality of the leads that we provide  our customers may choose not to extend their contracts for our services or may choose to terminate their contracts 
real estate professionals remain customers typically only for a limited period of time  and we have limited ability to predict how long they will remain customers 
the majority of our customer contracts have an initial term of twelve months  with automatic one month extensions unless terminated by either party 
some customers have decided not to extend their contracts due to their inability to convert the leads we have provided into closed transactions  due to their dissatisfaction with our services  or their inability to pay for our services 
we cannot accurately predict how long real estate professionals will remain customers 
acquisitions we may undertake may be unsuccessful and may divert our management s attention and consume significant resources 
we may selectively acquire other businesses  product lines or technologies 
the successful execution of an acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and  if necessary  to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions  dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  reduction or replacement of the sales of existing services by sales of products or services from acquired lines of business  responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses  inability to maintain our internal standards  controls  procedures and policies  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 

table of contents acquisitions may not be successful  and if we are unable to effectively manage the risks described above or other risks we encounter  our business  operating results or financial condition may be negatively affected 
for example  we acquired the loan page in october as part of our strategic objective to capitalize on the synergies between real estate and mortgage professionals 
due to deteriorating market conditions  operational challenges  and increasing competition in this market  we did not meet our financial objectives and decided in january to discontinue the semi exclusive lead product we obtained as part of that acquisition 
our revenues were lower in due in part to this decision  and we recorded a significant impairment loss in related to that acquisition 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could harm our business 
we may be required to take an impairment charge for goodwill or other long lived assets  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have acquired certain portions of our business through acquisitions and may continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies as part of our long term business strategy 
in connection with prior acquisitions  we have accounted for the portion of the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill and may be required to do so for future acquisitions 
additionally  we have invested in other long lived assets designed to enhance our product offerings or assist in achieving our business plan for our company 
under the applicable accounting rules  goodwill is not amortized and is carried on our books at its original value  subject to periodic review and evaluation for impairment  whereas intangible and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over the life of the asset 
our common stock was trading below our book value per share at the end of as a result  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million in which eliminated the remaining balance 
we expect to conduct further impairment reviews of our other long lived assets 
if  as a result of our periodic review and evaluation of our other long lived assets for potential impairment  we determine that changes in the business itself  the economic environment including business valuation levels and trends  or the legislative or regulatory environment have adversely affected either the fair value of the business or the fair value of our assets  we may be required to take additional impairment charges 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this could increase the likelihood that we will need to record additional impairment charges 
while we have a plan to restore our business fundamentals to levels that would support our book value per share  we have no assurance that the plan will be achieved or that the market price of our common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future 
in that event  we may be required to take an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of our net assets exceed the fair value of our overall business  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we rely almost entirely on advertising to generate leads for customers 
we rely heavily on advertising to attract consumers to our web sites and to generate traffic and leads 
we advertise primarily through online media and television commercials 
business risks associated with online advertising 
we rely on online media to attract a significant percentage of the consumers visiting our web sites 
prices for online advertising have increased as a result of increased demand for advertising inventory  which has caused our expenses to increase and has resulted in lower margins 
our advertising contracts with online search engines are typically short term 
if one or more search engines on which we rely for advertising modifies or terminates its relationship with us  our expenses could further increase  the number of leads we generate could decrease and our revenues or margins could decline 

table of contents business risks associated with television advertising 
television advertising rates depend on a number of factors  including the strength of the national economy and regional economies and the strength of certain industries that advertise frequently 
advertising rates are also subject to cyclical and seasonal fluctuations 
if television advertising prices increase significantly or if the effectiveness of this advertising declines  in the absence of more efficient ways to generate leads  our marketing expenses will also increase  which would harm our results of operations 
if we are required to drive additional traffic for an increasing customer base or if the number of leads that we are required to deliver increases  we may be required to increase the levels of advertising to meet those requirements 
increasing our advertising expenditures may not result in increases in traffic or leads 
if the effectiveness of our advertising declines  our business will suffer 
we may invest our cash in securities that become illiquid or that significantly decrease in value 
we may invest our cash in securities that are affected by adverse market conditions 
current market conditions and lack of investor confidence have led to reduced liquidity in securities that had previously been viewed as more liquid 
as a result  our investments may decline in value  or we may not be able to access our cash equivalents or short term investments when needed for strategic investment purposes or for operations and capital expenditures 
loss of cash value and inability to access funds would harm our business 
we may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims 
other companies  including our current or potential competitors  could make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to  claims regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
any intellectual property claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns 
we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights  but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our technologies and content may not be able to withstand third party claims or rights against their use 
if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims  we may have to pay damages  stop using the technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights  seek a license for the infringing technology or content  or develop alternative non infringing technology or content 
if we are required to obtain a license for the infringing technology or content  it may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  developing alternative non infringing technology or content could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business  we may be forced to limit our service offerings 
any of these results could reduce our ability to compete effectively and harm our business 
our trademarks are important to our business 
other companies may own  obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent  limit or interfere with our use of trademarks 
if we were unable to use these trademarks  our business would be harmed and we would need to devote substantial resources toward developing different brand identities 
our business model is evolving and our future operating results are unpredictable 
the success of our business model depends on our ability to attract new and retain existing customers and to efficiently generate traffic and leads 
any failure to execute this strategy could harm our business 
our business model is constantly evolving 
further  because our newer vision based products allow customers to adjust their advertising expenditure as business needs dictate  our revenue may become more variable 
additionally  because the margin on advertising revenue is less than that of software subscriptions  overall margins may be more variable and lower depending upon the mix of advertising revenue 

table of contents we may have to increase our expenses as we seek to expand our business and diversify our product mix 
we cannot assure you that our strategies to return to growth will be successful or that we will return to profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
prospective home buyers and sellers may be reluctant to sign up for our services due to general privacy concerns 
concern among consumers regarding our use of personal information collected on our web sites  such as email addresses  home addresses and geographic preferences  could keep them from using our web sites and thereby reduce the number of leads we generate 
industry wide events or events with respect to our web sites  including misappropriation of third party information  security breaches  or changes in industry standards  regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our web sites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  which could harm our business 
we rely on the collection  use and disclosure of personally identifiable information from prospective home buyers and sellers and from customers to conduct our business 
we disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our web sites  which we may modify from time to time to meet operational needs or changes in the law or industry best practices 
we may be subject to legal claims  government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement  customer expectations or the law 
in addition  concern among real estate professionals or potential home buyers or sellers about our privacy practices could keep them from using our services and require us to alter our business practices or incur significant expenses to educate them about how we use this information 
further  changes in laws and regulations applicable to the privacy of personal information or in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations  could require us to modify our practices regarding use  collection  protection and disclosure of such information 
any required modifications could result in significant expenses to us 
the value of our services could be diminished if anti spam software filters out emails we send 
our prospect management system includes a feature that automatically sends out personalized email messages to prospective home buyers and sellers on behalf of real estate professionals who are our customers 
in addition  we send a large amount of email to real estate professionals as part of our customer acquisition strategy  some of which is unsolicited 
in the past  anti spam software used by internet service providers and personal computer users has filtered out these email messages as unsolicited email  or spam 
if this problem persists or becomes more pervasive  the value of our prospect management system to customers  and our ability to attract new customers  could be reduced  both of which would harm our business 
in addition  it is possible that we may not currently or in the future fully comply with anti spam legislation  and any failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties or damage our reputation 
we rely on information from real estate multiple listing services provided by third parties that we do not control 
the web sites we provide to our vision customers combine aerial maps and for sale home listings  including listings in most of the major metropolitan markets in the united states 
in addition  in selected markets  including most of the major metropolitan markets in the united states  we provide customers with functionality that allows them to automatically email their prospective clients information about newly available homes that meet the prospective clients criteria 
the for sale home listings information provided by our web sites and the automated email functionality are supplied only in markets in which we  our broker customers  or the broker affiliated with our agent customers have a relationship with the local multiple listing service mls 
our agreements with mlss to display property listings have short terms  or can be terminated by the mlss  or  in some cases  the broker  with little notice 
the success of our products depends in part on our continued ability to provide customers with mls listings and data  as well as our ability to expand listings in markets in which it is not currently available 
our inability to supply this information will harm our business and operating results 

table of contents if we fail to comply with the various laws and regulations that govern the real estate industry  our business may be harmed 
our business is governed by various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the real estate industry  including the real estate settlement procedures act respa  the fair housing act  state and local real estate broker licensing laws  federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices  and federal and state advertising laws 
we may not have always been and may not always be in compliance with each of these requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  revocation of required licenses  indemnification liability to contract counterparties  class action lawsuits  administrative enforcement actions and civil and criminal liability 
due to the geographic scope of our operations and the nature of the services we provide  we may be required to obtain and maintain real estate brokerage licenses in certain states in which we operate 
in connection with such licenses  we are required to designate individual licensed brokers of record 
we cannot assure you that we are  and will remain at all times  in full compliance with state real estate licensing laws and regulations and we may be subject to fines or penalties in the event of any non compliance 
if in the future a state agency were to determine that we are required to obtain a real estate brokerage license in that state in order to receive payments or commissions from real estate professionals  or if we lose the services of a designated broker  we may be subject to fines or legal penalties or our business operations in that state may be suspended until we obtain the license or replace the designated broker 
any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may limit our ability to expand into new markets  offer new products or continue to operate in one or more of our current markets 
we may be limited in the way in which we market our business or generate revenue by federal law prohibiting referral fees in real estate transactions 
respa generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other thing of value for the referral of business related to a residential real estate settlement service  including real estate brokerage services 
respa also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services 
however  respa expressly permits payments pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and brokers 
in addition  respa permits payments for goods or facilities furnished or for services actually performed  so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or facilities furnished or the services performed  excluding the value of any referrals that may be provided in connection with such goods  facilities or services 
failure to comply with respa may result in  among other things  administrative enforcement actions  class action lawsuits  and civil and criminal liability 
there has been limited guidance by the appropriate federal regulator or the courts regarding the applicability of respa to online marketing relationships for real estate or mortgage services  including those we provide 
nonetheless  respa may restrict our ability to enter into marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  particularly to the extent that such arrangements may be characterized as involving payments for the referral of residential real estate settlement service business 
we rely on our sales force to sell our services and increase revenue 
failure to attract  motivate and retain qualified sales personnel may harm our business 
we have high productivity standards for our sales personnel  which in the past has resulted in relatively high turnover 
this turnover has required us to expend a substantial amount of time and money to replace sales persons as we expand our business 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense 
any failure to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel could impair our ability to generate new customers  which would harm our business 

table of contents our business could be harmed by the actions of third parties over whom we have little or no control 
prospective home buyers and sellers could make a claim against us for the actions of a real estate agent or broker customer over whom we have little or no control 
we do not conduct any due diligence or background checks on new customers or seek information regarding their credentials 
we may be liable for content provided by customers that is posted on or disseminated through our web sites 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover us for these liabilities  and  to the extent not covered by insurance  these liabilities could reduce our margins and harm our business 
our brand could be harmed if customers do not provide quality service to prospective home buyers and sellers 
we rely on real estate professionals who are our customers of our lead generating products to promote our brand by providing high quality service to prospective home buyers and sellers 
we have little control over the activities of customers 
if customers do not provide prospective home buyers and sellers with high quality service  or if they use the functionality of our systems to send unwanted email to prospective home buyers or sellers  our brand value and our ability to generate leads may diminish 
our operating results may be subject to seasonality and may vary significantly among quarters during a calendar year 
we are subject to seasonal fluctuations in advertising rates and lead generation 
changing consumer behavior at various times throughout the year affects our advertising expenses 
television advertising is generally more expensive in the fourth calendar quarter in connection with the holiday season 
while individual markets vary  real estate transaction activity tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  and then gradually slows over the last quarter of the calendar year 
the real estate industry generally experiences decreased activity toward the end of the year  which may result in slower lead generation and lower growth rates 
throughout the history of our company  our quarterly revenue changes have masked seasonality effects 
as a result  investors may be unable to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our operating results 
third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  the value of our services could be diminished and our business may suffer 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and on our continuing use of our trademarks 
we hold thirteen registered trademarks registered in the united states and three trademarks registered in canada 
we have sought registration for a number of additional trademarks 
we have not sought registration for any copyrights 
we have not been issued any patents and do not have any pending patent applications 
accordingly  our intellectual property position is more vulnerable than it otherwise would be if it were protected by issued patents  copyrights or additional registered trademarks 
we may not receive approval of our various trademark or patent applications  and any trademarks or patents we may be granted may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark or patent applications are not approved or if our trademarks or patents are invalidated  our use of them could be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with these third parties  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we regard substantial elements of our web sites  software tools and applications and underlying technology as proprietary 
despite our precautionary measures  third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or may develop similar technology independently 
we may not be 
table of contents able to detect such infringements or may lose any competitive advantage in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies substantially similar to ours 
unauthorized parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technology 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
any legal action that we may bring to protect our proprietary information could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
increased government regulation of the internet and claims under state consumer protection laws could force us to change the manner in which we conduct our business or result in monetary fines or increased costs 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on us 
laws and regulations relating to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
in addition  the interpretation and application of laws applicable to the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws  such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation  apply to the internet 
new laws and regulations  and changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations relating to the internet  could lead to situations in which we are considered to operate or do business in states where customers conduct their business  resulting in potential claims or regulatory action 
if we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations  or if we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations  our business could be harmed 
our practices may not have always been and may not always be in compliance with the requirements of internet related laws or regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative enforcement actions  class action lawsuits  and civil and criminal liability 
we may be subject to claims under state consumer protection statutes if our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our leads  customer service  training programs or contract cancellation policies 
these claims could result in monetary fines or require us to change the manner in which we conduct our business  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any of these types of claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  could harm our reputation and could be expensive to litigate or settle 
changes in government regulation of advertising and customer solicitation could affect our business 
we rely on various marketing channels  such as email and other means of electronic and telephonic communication  to reach real estate professionals and prospective home buyers and sellers and other consumers 
the laws governing marketing and advertising continue to evolve and we may be subject to restrictions that limit our ability to continue to operate or expand our business and could result in legal claims or government action 
for example  a federal statute places restrictions on unsolicited commercial email  commonly known as spam  and imposes obligations upon senders of commercial email 
additionally  state laws governing falsity or deception with regard to email apply in addition to the federal statute 
these federal and state laws impose significant civil and criminal penalties for violations 
as the interpretation and enforcement of these laws evolve  they may impose burdens on our email marketing practices and affect features of our customer relationship management systems and other services we offer or may offer 
in addition  federal and state statutes prohibiting false or deceptive acts in commerce apply to internet advertising  and some states have passed legislation regulating internet advertising 
the requirements of some of these laws  and their interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities  are not clear and uniform 
these laws may adversely affect our ability to market our services to real estate industry participants in a cost effective manner and the violation of these laws may result in enforcement actions and penalties or damage our reputation 

table of contents our sales activities are or may in the future be subject to laws regulating telemarketing  which could subject us to penalties or limit our ability to market our services 
both federal and state laws regulate the practice of telemarketing and placing other commercial telephone calls 
all states have enacted some form of telemarketing law  and federal statutes and regulations place restrictions on live  recorded and text telemarketing calls 
in particular  the federal government and a significant number of states have implemented do not call lists 
in addition  a number of states require telemarketers to register with the state and post a bond  regulate or prohibit automated systems and recorded messages  impose disclosure requirements upon sales calls and require written sales contracts for certain telemarketing transactions 
we are subject to certain of these laws  and our failure to register in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to penalties  limit our ability to market our services and hamper our ability to enforce contracts in these jurisdictions 
other violations of these laws may damage our reputation and may result in administrative enforcement  fines and civil or criminal penalties 
any failure of our technology to perform satisfactorily could result in lost revenue  damage to our reputation and expenditure of significant resources 
our technology is relatively new and complex and may in the future be subject to errors  defects or performance problems 
in addition  we may encounter problems when we update our technology to expand and enhance its capabilities 
our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after further use 
furthermore  our services could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by customers or prospective home buyers and sellers 
in such instances  we would need to expend significant resources to address these problems  and may nonetheless be unable to adequately remedy these problems 
these problems could result in lost revenue and damage to our reputation 
sustained or repeated system failures could significantly impair our operations and lead to customer dissatisfaction 
the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our systems is critical to our success 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these systems against damage from fire  power loss  water  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  viruses  vandalism and other malicious acts and similar unexpected adverse events 
customers and prospective home buyers and sellers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them 
our services substantially depend on systems provided by third parties  over whom we have little control 
interruptions in our services could result from the failure of telecommunications providers and other third parties to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame required 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  located at our headquarters in kirkland  washington and at co location facilities operated by third parties 
we depend on these third party providers of internet communication services to provide continuous and uninterrupted service 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide access to our services 
any disruption in the internet access provided by third party providers or any failure of third party providers to handle higher volumes of user traffic could harm our business 
our customers  our reputation and our products may be harmed by security breaches 
unauthorized computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates our network security could misappropriate personal information about our customers  proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we also may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our systems and harm our business 

table of contents several payment card brands and an independent standards body have adopted security standards  compliance with which is required of all merchants and service providers that process  transmit or store certain types of personal information pertaining to credit card holders 
if we fail to comply with these standards  we could be subject to fines and our ability to accept some or all credit cards could be restricted or suspended 
any such suspension or restriction would significantly affect our ability to collect fees from our customers  many of whom pay with a credit card 
this would result in harm to our business 
additionally  the majority of states and various federal regulatory bodies now require companies that maintain personal information about consumers to notify those consumers in the event of a breach of security in which certain types of personal information relating to those consumers is  or is suspected to have been  obtained by an unauthorized person 
these laws vary in their scope and requirements  and some of them also require notice to governmental agencies and other third parties 
in addition  other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported 
if we are required to disclose a security breach to consumers or other third parties  our business and reputation could be harmed 
if we do not have access to additional funds on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue to expand our business or service offerings 
to pursue our current and future business plans  we may choose to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
recently  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain financing and may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for future strategic initiatives  operations or capital expenditures 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights superior to those of our common stock

overview market leader  inc provides real estate professionals with innovative marketing and technology solutions that enable them to grow and manage their business 
founded in by a second generation real estate agent  market leader provides real estate agents  agent teams  and brokerage companies with subscription software and advertising products that enable them to generate a steady stream of prospects  as well as the tools and training they need to convert these prospects into clients 
current year overview revenue was million for the year  down from the prior year  primarily because our overall customer base has declined 
we have experienced quarterly revenue declines over the past few years 
however  our sequential quarterly revenue declines moderated in the second half of the year  driven by growth in revenue from our newer vision products 
in addition  an increased share of our customer base has been with the company for two years or longer  and those customers demonstrate above average retention rates 
we believe our revenue trend continues to be influenced by broader real estate market conditions 
while existing home sales in were stronger than as reported by the national association of realtors  average sale prices were lower and real estate commissions declined according to research from real trends  inc we believe this most directly impacts the investment that real estate professionals are able to make in marketing services such as ours 
even as market conditions and real estate commissions begin to improve  market leader expects real estate professionals to continue to remain cautious regarding new marketing expenditures for at least a couple of quarters as they recover from what has been a prolonged and significant downturn 
during  we continued to make progress on our business model shift toward our vision products 
in  we began the shift in our business model from our traditional lead generation products that deliver home seller or buyer leads to customers via an online software tool that is bundled with the offerings to offerings that combine software as a service with access to advertising buying and lead generation services 
our original model is represented by our housevalues and justlisted products while our new model is represented by our vision products  including growth leader  team leader and realty generator 
see business for a specific discussion of our products 
our acquisition of realty generator  llc and a related entity in november enabled us to leverage the technology and business model acquired to develop our vision products 
our vision product revenue doubled in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of and represented percent of our revenue in the fourth quarter of  demonstrating the progress on our business model shift 
the majority of the million in vision product revenue in the fourth quarter of came from our realtygenerator product 
we also continued to see growth and promising results from our growth leader product during at the end of the fourth quarter we had  growth leader customers as compared to customers at the beginning of the year 
growth leader also played an important role in our 
table of contents customer retention efforts as certain customers of our traditional lead generation products that intended to cancel have switched to the growth leader product  effectively extending the life of those customers 
despite the growth in our vision product revenue during  the decline in our traditional lead generation product revenue  primarily in the first half of  resulted in the decrease in our total revenue 
in  we expect continued revenue growth from our vision products will offset continued revenue declines from our traditional products 
while we expect continued revenue fluctuations during and beyond  we believe that the fourth quarter of marked the end of our revenue declines 
our longer term goal is to return the company to profitable growth  and we believe that to do so will require resurgence in customer acquisition 
towards that goal  we expect to increase the size of our sales force in we also continue to test new sales methods  such as the strategic marketing partnership with realty executives international rei 
more than one hundred and forty of this firm s franchised brokerages signed agreements with us through a special realtygenerator trial program that was created for this franchise network 
while some of the rei brokerage companies have yet to complete their trials  of the brokerages that have completed their trials  the majority have elected to continue with realtygenerator 
this experience  in addition to a prior smaller but successful initiative with exit realty  supports the company s belief that enterprise level relationships can effectively accelerate customer acquisition 
we expect to develop additional enterprise level relationships in over the past three years  we have adapted to changing market conditions by better aligning expenses with expected revenue in an effort to avoid non strategic uses of cash 
we reduced a significant non strategic expense as a result of our successful renegotiation of our kirkland  washington facility lease in the second quarter  the first full cost savings benefit was realized in the third quarter 
the lease amendment eliminated the expense of excess space  avoided fees for early lease termination  and kept the team in our current location focused on building the business 
we believe that the strategic value of investment in our business has been significantly enhanced by our introduction of innovative products 
we used cash in operations in as part of a strategy to better present our new solutions and to gain share of mind and market ahead of the inflection point in real estate commissions 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year compared to net loss million in our net loss in includes an income tax benefit of million based on new legislation that allowed the carry back of losses up to five years 
our net loss in includes noncash impairment charges of million 
see further discussion of these items in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of seasonality and cyclicality the residential real estate and advertising markets are influenced by seasonality as well as overall economic cycles 
seasonality real estate transaction activity tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  and then gradually slows over the last quarter of the calendar year 
as a result  we may experience slower lead generation and customer adoption toward the end of the year 
we are also subject to seasonal fluctuations in advertising rates and lead generation 
television advertising costs are generally more expensive in the second and fourth calendar quarters in connection with network premieres and finales and the holiday season 
cyclicality the success of our business depends on the health of the residential real estate market  which historically has been subject to economic cycles 
following a period of sustained growth  the residential real estate market 
table of contents has entered a down cycle 
housing prices have declined and residential real estate transactions have slowed significantly in major markets that are important to our business 
typically  during downturns in housing markets  demand for residential real estate decreases and demand for the services of real estate professionals similarly decreases 
in these markets  the number of real estate professionals may decline significantly as less successful agents and brokers leave the profession and fewer people seek to become real estate professionals 
a decline in the number of customers or a decrease in the amount they wish to spend on services such as ours will negatively impact our revenue and increase our customer acquisition costs 
in addition  the decline in the demand for housing could increase our lead generation costs and adversely impact our margins 
trends in the real estate market are unpredictable and individual geographic markets vary  therefore our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader real estate industry  may be subject to significant fluctuation 
significant business developments the following significant business developments affect the comparability of our financial statements company re launch as market leader 
in november of  we took a series of steps to effectively re launch the company with a new corporate identity  a new stock ticker symbol  and the new business model tied to our vision product offerings 
in  we shifted sales resources from our traditional products to drive rapid growth of our vision offerings 
this new business model provided the majority of revenue in the fourth quarter of and is expected to drive a larger portion of revenue in purchase of realty generator 
on november   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realty generator  llc and a related entity 
including contingent consideration based on the subsequent performance of the acquired assets through june   the total purchase price for realty generator  llc was approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities 
we accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and have included realty generator s results of operations from the transaction date forward 
investment in activerain 
on november   we acquired of the outstanding voting stock of activerain real estate network for million 
during september activerain s redemption of founder shares increased our ownership percentage to 
activerain is a professional community and social networking platform serving the real estate community 
activerain has grown its membership over the past two years to more than  real estate professionals 
our investment in activerain is recorded using the equity method of accounting which requires that we record our proportionate share of their net loss adjusted for any difference between our cost and the underlying equity in their net assets at the acquisition date 
reduction in cost structure 
as broader market conditions have contributed to the decline in our revenue  we have taken a series of actions to significantly reduce our cost structure to align with our revenue trends 
in addition to significant cost reduction efforts in and and the reduction of the cost of our corporate headquarters in discussed above  we took the following actions in reduction in workforce 
in january  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
we recorded cash severance charges of approximately million and additional accelerated vesting charges of million related to equity compensation in the first quarter of disposition of the yakima facility 
in january  we terminated our lease for a satellite facility and in a related transaction  assigned our purchase option for the facility and its remaining assets to a third party for net cash of million 
we recorded a gain of million on this transaction in the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues expenses sales and marketing technology and product development general and administrative depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of acquired intangible assets gain on sale of fixed assets impairment of goodwill and long lived assets total expenses loss from operations equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary interest income and expense  net income tax benefit net loss comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands revenues revenues declined from last year 
this decrease is due primarily to a decline in our average customer count and a decline in average revenue per customer 
we believe the cyclical downturn in the real estate industry has negatively impacted the ability of real estate professionals to pay for marketing services and other lead generation costs  which is reflected in our decreased customer base and our lower average revenue per customer 
we nonetheless improved our customer retention rates in compared to more detailed information about the sequential change in revenue and customers is included under the heading key operational metrics below 
in  we anticipate that revenues from our vision products realtygenerator  team leader  and growth leader will drive a majority of revenue 
based on our experience with both the realtygenerator product and growth leader  we believe the vision product offerings will help us to achieve better customer retention rates and improved operating results over time 
we believe that vision product revenue will continue to grow in  and this factor combined with the expected customer retention benefit of the majority of our customers having two or more years of tenure  creates what we see as  the potential for revenue growth by as early as the end of 
table of contents sales and marketing years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and television advertising  as well as salaries  commissions and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff 
other expenses include credit card fees and corporate marketing and communications expenses 
sales and marketing expense decreased during when compared to  primarily due to reduced advertising costs lead and traffic generation costs and reduced customer acquisition expenses  as well as a reduction in personnel costs 
we managed lower advertising costs relative to our revenue base  although advertising costs increased slightly as a percentage of revenue due to the shift in our product mix to our vision based products for which advertising represents a higher percentage of related revenue 
we also reduced our expenses in response to the current business environment by reducing staffing costs 
headcount at december  for our sales and marketing groups decreased to  compared to at december  while we have managed a lower overall expense level  sales and marketing expense has increased relative to revenue on the lower revenue base 
in  we expect sales and marketing expense to increase modestly as we increase our sales resources that we intend to drive future revenue growth 
advertising costs will also change relative to changes in our revenue 
technology and product development years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands technology and product development expense technology and product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees responsible for customer and internal technology services 
also included are license fees  maintenance costs  internet and phone connectivity and hosting costs 
technology and product development expense decreased in as compared to  as we reduced our business expenses in recognition of our lower revenues 
we believe we have maintained resources required to deliver new products and enhancements  as well as to support our products and infrastructure 
while we have reduced costs in this area  technology and product development expense has increased relative to our lower revenue base 
in  we expect the level of technology and product development costs to remain fairly consistent with amounts as we continue to enhance our vision based products and to develop new product offerings on the vision platform 

table of contents general and administrative years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  accounting  and human resources personnel 
these costs also include audit and legal fees  business consulting fees  business insurance premiums  rent and related expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased due to reduced staffing and occupancy expenses 
staffing costs declined due to lower stock compensation charges  changes in the staffing mix and lower incentive compensation 
lower occupancy expenses reflect the terms of our amended lease that reduced the size of our corporate headquarters 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to our lower revenue base 
in  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly in total dollars as we manage operational costs 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets during  based on our history of operating losses and the decline in the economy and in the market value of our common stock  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and long lived assets and assessed potential impairment using market prices and other available information 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased year over year primarily because many assets became fully depreciated during and the first half of amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of intangible assets remained consistent for when compared to  due to no significant changes in intangible assets 
equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary our equity in the losses of activerain decreased in when compared to  primarily due to an impairment charge of million that was recorded in the other than temporary impairment was the result of an evaluation of the estimated fair value of our investment at december  that indicated a fair value that was less than its carrying value  and that the impairment was other than temporary 
interest income and expense  net interest income decreased in when compared to due to decreased rates of return on investments as well as a reduction in the amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held 
early in  we modified our investment strategy to preserve the security and liquidity of our funds  which has resulted in significantly lower rates of return 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  
table of contents income taxes we recognized a million tax benefit in as a result of legislation passed in november that allows us to carryback our operating losses and recover taxes paid in and there was no similar carryback opportunity in substantially all of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse over the next five years  except for prior years net operating losses 
we believe that based on the decline in the national real estate market and our recent history of operating losses  it is more likely than not that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets

one minus our average monthly churn rate equates to our average monthly retention rate 
average monthly customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers who canceled during the quarter by the average customers in the quarter  divided by the number of months in the quarter 
other companies may 
table of contents calculate churn and retention differently  and their churn and retention data may not be directly comparable to ours 
average real estate professional customers in the quarter are calculated as the average of customers at the beginning and at the end of the quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer is calculated as real estate professional revenue for the quarter divided by the average number of customers in the quarter 
on a sequential quarter basis  our customer count decreased by customers during the fourth quarter of  compared to a decrease of customers in the third quarter of ending customers at december  decreased compared to december  the average monthly retention rate for our customers was for the fourth quarter of  an improvement over the third quarter of retention rate of 
this new historic high retention rate is the highest achieved during the comparably measured quarters since  and we consider it to be the best in the company s history 
we believe that the continued strong trend can be attributed to a combination of factors the increased portion of revenue from our vision products  a smaller overall customer base  as well as the majority of customers now being at least two year tenured and demonstrating above average retention 
however  due to the continued volatility of the real estate market and broader economic concerns  we expect to experience fluctuations in our customer retention rate from quarter to quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer for the fourth quarter of increased slightly compared to the third quarter of as a result of the shift in our product mix towards our broker and other vision products  as well as the end of subsidized trial periods for some of these customers 
average revenue per customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the mix of sales for products priced differently across lower and higher priced geographies  pricing adjustments we may make in response to the market conditions  the demand for existing services and the acceptance of new product offerings 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we may generate from our operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  early in  we modified our investment strategy to preserve the security and liquidity of our funds  which has resulted in significantly lower rates of return 
as of december   we have invested in cash equivalents consisting of money market funds that hold u 
s 
treasury securities with short term weighted average duration 
short term investments are comprised of u 
s 
treasury bills and notes and fdic insured certificates of deposit with terms of one year or less 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue trend  the level of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  and the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services 
the following table presents summary cash flow data year ended december  dollars in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities 
table of contents we expect to expand our revenue growth initiatives with new sales and business development hires in these investments in the business will increase our use of cash while these resources are training and ahead of their revenue contribution 
under our business model  we generally collect monthly fees from customers before the related advertising expenses are incurred  and as a result  we are able to operate with negative working capital that does not limit our ability to grow our business 
operating activities net cash from operating activities consists of our net operating results adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  gains on sales of fixed assets  equity in loss of our unconsolidated subsidiary  impairment of goodwill and the effect of changes in working capital 
we used cash in operations of million in compared to cash provided by operations of million in cash was used in operations in primarily due to an increase in our net loss after non cash items 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for was million compared to the cash provided by investing activities for of million 
during  we made net short term investments of million compared to net sales of short term investments of million in also in  we received proceeds of million from the assignment of our purchase option for the yakima facility and the transfer of all remaining assets in the facility 
financing activities cash used in financing activities decreased by million compared to the same period in primarily due to the repayment of an outstanding note for million and the purchase of million of our common stock 
purchase and retirement of common stock in october  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase and retire up to million shares of our common stock 
we did not make any purchases pursuant to the share repurchase program during at december    shares remain available for purchase under the share repurchase program 
during february and september  an aggregate of  and  shares of our common stock were tendered at and per share  respectively  in satisfaction of employees income taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies and estimates we feel are critical 
business combinations  intangible assets  and goodwill valuation when acquired 
we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the 
table of contents date of acquisition  as well as the valuation of any contingent consideration 
significant judgment is used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
our intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the assessment of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill requires significant judgment to determine the asset groups and number of reporting units  to estimate future cash flows  to use appropriate market value factors  to estimate the related asset lives and other assumptions as noted below 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the fair value determination and potential goodwill impairment 
results of impairment tests 
based on our continued operating losses  we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
based on difficult economic conditions  significant decline in our stock price and other factors  we evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of as a result  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
we also evaluated our long lived assets for impairment and determined that we did not have an impairment charge related to our long lived assets 
our impairment analyses for goodwill were dependent on many variables 
we determined the fair value of our net assets based on a combination of market and income approaches 
key assumptions used in the market approaches included the determination that we have a single reporting unit  the appropriate stock price to determine market value  use of control premium and determination of the appropriate control premium  determination of an appropriate set of comparable companies 
key assumptions in the income approach were based on a discounted cash flow model  which included significant assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
our impairment analyses for our long lived assets other than goodwill included a number of key variables  included estimated future cash flows 
we determined the fair value of our long lived assets based on several key assumptions  including the determination that we have a single asset grouping  references to quoted market prices for similar assets  estimates of replacement cost  as well as assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
although we have no goodwill remaining  we continue to carry approximately million of long lived assets as of december   and while we continue to depreciate these assets  at the same time  we continue to capitalize costs related to internally generated software and may acquire other capital assets 
factors that may require future assessments of impairment of our long lived assets include  among others  deterioration of our estimate of future cash flows or stock price or lower customer revenues or retention rates than projected 
investment in unconsolidated subsidiary valuation when acquired 
we paid million for an interest in activerain real estate network during as there was a difference of million between our cost and our share of the underlying equity in activerain s net assets  we were required to apply purchase accounting methodology to identify intangible assets and goodwill acquired 
significant judgment was used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
we identified and assigned values to in process research and development  developed technology  trade name and member base  in addition to goodwill 

table of contents ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
as our investment represents an ownership interest of  a significant ownership interest  we apply the equity method of accounting 
therefore our investment represents our original investment and our proportionate share of their net loss  as adjusted for the impact of amortization or impairment of the identified intangible assets and goodwill 
results of impairment tests 
our investment must also be periodically reviewed to determine whether the value of the investment may be impaired on an other than temporary basis 
the determination of the fair value of this asset is dependent on material judgment and estimates 
as activerain is a privately held company  fair values are based primarily on the income approach using management s estimates of future cash flows 
this analysis therefore includes the same significant assumptions used when we recorded our initial investment in activerain  as well as the determination that impairment is other than temporary 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment for our activerain investment as of december  resulted in an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our investment to our estimate of fair value  million 
we determined there was no further impairment to our investment in activerain as of december  we expect to continue to record our proportionate share of activerain s net income or losses in  and do not expect to record future impairment losses in the near term due to the decreased carrying value of our investment of million at december  accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards in our existing business and related to acquisitions 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes and the related current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates must take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits 
new tax legislation was passed in november  which allows us to carry back losses up to five years 
as a result  we recorded a tax refund receivable of million as of december  changes in the amount of our operating losses  changes in the tax laws or our interpretation of the tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowances required in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  before reduction for our valuation allowance 
we considered all available evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance was required for those assets  including the following factors estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years as permitted under tax law  historical taxable income  normalized for non recurring items  expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our current projections of future operating profits  we continue to believe that it is not likely that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets at december  we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement 
our accounting policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation related to option grants using the fair value based method 
we use the black scholes pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including estimating the stock option expected life and stock price volatility 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of options granted 
the following table illustrates the effect of changing these significant variables on the estimated fair value of our options 
the following examples are hypothetical but representative of our option grants and their related fair values at december  in each analysis  the remaining variables are held constant 
this illustration is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation

the asc was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   and we have updated all references to authoritative literature effective with our form q for the quarter ended september  the adoption had no impact on the reporting of our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance now codified within asc topic  consolidation asc 
asc requires entities to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as one with the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november  we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple delivery revenue arrangements asu 
asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities  and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments of asu also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a
