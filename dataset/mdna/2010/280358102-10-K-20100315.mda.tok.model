results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the million increase in total revenue  service revenue  excluding software and reimbursable expense revenue  increased by million  or  to million  as compared to service revenue of million in the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to the full year contributions of alecian  lynx and vertical pitch the acquisitions  which was offset by a reduction in service revenue generated from certain legacy accounts within our technology service offerings 
during  service revenue from our top five largest customers amounted to million  or of our total service revenue 
in  service revenue generated from our top five largest customers amounted to million  or of our total service revenue 
our top five largest customers have historically been comprised of legacy accounts associated with our core business service offerings and include services such as infrastructure support  custom software development and systems integration 
we believe that the current year reduction in the services that we have historically provided to our larger legacy customers is directly related to  and being impacted by  the current economic environment  which is placing increased pressure on our legacy customers to either reduce or delay it related expenditures for services typically provided by our company 

table of contents software revenue  which is directly attributable to our epm offering  decreased by million  to million in  as compared to million in software sales are not a primary driver of our revenue and are at times generated through the sale of our epm related service offerings 
as such  our ability to generate revenue from such software sales is inherently unpredictable 
gross profit margins are generally much lower on software sales than on consulting services 
generally  we are reimbursed for our out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with our customer s consulting projects 
reimbursed expense revenue increased approximately million in  to approximately million  as compared to million in the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate from year to year depending on the location of our customers  the general fluctuation of travel costs  such as airfare  and the number of our projects that require travel 
our annualized revenue per billable consultant  adjusted for utilization  increased  to thousand in  as compared to thousand in the improvement in this metric is due to full year impact of the acquisitions 
the acquisitions were primarily related to our epm service offerings  which have higher average consultant billing rates than those traditionally experienced in our technology service offerings 
during  the company increased the number of customers it served to  as compared to customers in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of project personnel costs principally related to salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits and travel expenses for personnel dedicated to customer projects 
these costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services 
in total  cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in the increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to the full year impact of adding billable consultants in connection with the acquisitions 
on a year over year basis  the company s total number of billable consultants has decreased by  to billable consultants at the end of  as compared to billable consultants at the end of the year over year decrease in billable consultant headcount is a result of current year attrition and a targeted reduction in connection with the decrease in legacy related projects and service revenue 
billable consultant reductions made in conjunction with the decrease in legacy account revenue were initiated by the company as cost cutting measures targeted at aligning company resources with demand for our services 
despite the year over year decrease in billable consultant headcount  the current year reductions did not significantly reduce total comparative wage related expenses as these initiatives were enacted primarily during the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  as a result of the cancellation of certain projects related to our legacy accounts  the company enacted additional cost cutting measures  reducing our billable consultant headcount by consultants 
the additional reductions in consultant headcount are expected to improve our billable consultant utilization rates and to reduce wage related cost of revenue  by approximately million  in reimbursable expenses  which increased by million  to million  as compared to million in  were a direct result of the company s increased customer base and associated travel related expenses incurred during the comparative years 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million in gross profit  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased to  as compared to in despite the current year million increase in service revenue  the comparative and gross profit  on an absolute dollar basis  remained consistent  while the gross profit margin decreased by 
both the absence of current year growth in gross profit and the reduction in the gross profit margin is primarily attributable to a decrease in billable consultant utilization rates 
the company s billable consultant utilization rate was in  as compared to in the year over year decrease is a direct result of an increase in excess capacity resulting from the reduction in legacy account service revenues 
the billable consultant headcount reductions initiated by the company during the fourth quarter of were made with the intention of reducing excess capacity 
historically  the company has targeted and operated at utilization rates ranging between and 
our utilization rate was  below our recent and targeted utilization ranges 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expenses increased to million  as compared to sg a expenses of million in the increase in sg a expense during was primarily due to increases in sales and management personnel related to our epm service offerings  comparatively higher sales commissions due to revenue growth in our non legacy accounts and an increase in training expenses as we expanded the skill sets of our billable consultants in order to meet the demands of the changing it marketplace 
the current year increases in sg a expenses were mitigated by comparative decreases in bonus accruals related to our performance based bonus plan  recruiting costs and marketing expenses 
sg a expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   which remains consistent with for the year ended december  there was only a modest increase in sg a expense  as a percentage of revenue  in the current year 
the company continues to monitor its sg a costs  with the goal of achieving greater economies of scale over the long term
