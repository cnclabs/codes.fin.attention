item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below  for a description of this matter and its effects on the company s fiscal consolidated financial statements  as well as for a reconciliation to the company s fiscal consolidated results of operations in accordance with us gaap 
project services we employ all of the engineering  design  architectural  and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  upstream oil gas  refining  food and consumer products  and basic resources industries  buildings including facilities for clients in the health care  education  and criminal justice markets  as well as other specialized buildings for clients in the private sector  infrastructure projects including highways  roads  bridges  and other transportation systems  water and wastewater treatment plants  water resources facilities  and other similar plants and facilities  technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace  automotive  defense  semiconductor  and electronics industries  consumer products manufacturing facilities  power plants and stations  pulp and paper plants  and other facilities 
we also employ many of the requisite scientific  technical  and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration  testing  and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries  for the dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers  for nasa for aerospace  testing  and propulsion systems and facilities  and for various other agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 
we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design 
through safety in design we integrate best practices  hazard analysis  and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects  taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction  start up  testing and commissioning  and operations phases of a project 
in the area of construction management  we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients 
we may act as the program director  whereby we oversee  on the owner s behalf  the complete planning  design  and construction phases of the project 
alternatively  our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

table of contents also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning  scheduling  procurement  estimating  cost engineering  project accounting  and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering  design  construction  construction and program management  operations and maintenance  and consulting services 
process  scientific and systems consulting we employ all of the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies  market analyses  and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project  performing gasoline reformulation modeling  analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants  analyzing automation and control systems  analyzing  designing  and executing biocontainment strategies  developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administration mandated qualification and validation requirements  providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects  and performing geological and metallurgical studies 
also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs 
such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide  and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems  weapons modeling and simulations  computer systems development  maintenance  and support  evaluation and testing of mission critical control systems  and other highly technical programs and tasks 
construction we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services 
in the area of environmental remediation and restoration  we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 
we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology 
our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design  off site fabrication and assembly  and field erection 
it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction  which can compress and shorten the construction schedule  reduce risk  and lower costs 
historically  our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work 
by focusing our construction efforts on such projects  we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties 
the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixed price contracts  therefore  we generally avoid this type of project 
however  we will pursue construction only projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe will result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 
operations and maintenance o m o m generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large  complex facilities on behalf of clients 
we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility  including managing subcontractors and other on site personnel 
within the environmental area  o m often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 
within the aerospace and defense areas  o m often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities  weapons integration facilities  and high tech simulation and verification centers 
such o m contracts also 
table of contents frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services  utilities operations and maintenance services  property management and disposition services  and construction support services 
o m also includes process plant maintenance services  which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in day to day operation 
such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps  piping  heat exchangers  and other equipment as well as turnaround work  which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down 
since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant  turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a hours per day  seven days per week basis 
we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly  and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 
although the gross profit margins that we realize from o m services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide  the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower 
additionally  although engineering and construction projects may be of a short term nature  o m services often result in long term relationships with clients 
for example  we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades 
this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 
financial information about segments although we describe our business in this annual report on form k in terms of the services we provide  the markets in which our clients operate  and the geographic areas in which we operate  we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the us in making this determination  we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide  the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services  and the types of customers we have 
in addition to the discussion that follows  please refer to note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories 
for example  engineering and design services ie  services provided by persons who are degreed  and in certain circumstances licensed  professionals such as engineers  architects  scientists  and economists exist in all four service categories 
in addition  there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and o m projects 
in providing construction and o m services  we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel 
these may include welders  pipe fitters  electricians  crane operators  and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the o m services category 
our operating units use a matrix organizational structure 
our results  therefore  are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg  electrical engineering  mechanical engineering  cost engineering  etc 
supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients  and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely  on time  and on budget 
additionally  all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools  policies  and procedures to manage and run their respective units 
these include project review meetings  project performance evaluations  and project execution plans 
the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform 
whether it is computer aided design and drafting cadd applications used by our engineering and design staff  or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff  or scheduling  estimating  and cost control applications used by home office 
table of contents personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities  all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 
furthermore  the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance  evaluate results of operations  allocate resources  and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment 
accordingly  based on these similarities  we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form k

backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
with respect to operations and maintenance o m contracts  however  we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for national government programs other than us federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  excluding option periods 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  termination  or suspension at the discretion of the client 
in addition  the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating 
table of contents to the contracts 
our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates 
for information regarding our backlog  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
significant customers the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute or more of the company s total revenues 
on occasion  however  we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which  primarily because of the amount of pass through costs discussed below that is included in revenue  will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed of total consolidated revenues 
for the fiscal year ended october  revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for of total consolidated revenues and for the fiscal year ended september  revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for of total consolidated revenues 
financial information about geographic areas selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
in such situations  our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 
table of contents cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed price contracts 
under lump sum bid contracts  we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
additionally  it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
accordingly  lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract 
in contrast  under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services  rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because we believe they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
competition for information regarding the competitive conditions in our business  please refer to item a risk factors  below 
employees at october   we had approximately  full time  staff employees including contract staff

item a 
risk factors construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces 
if we fail to maintain safe work sites  we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 
construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment  moving vehicles  chemical and manufacturing processes  and highly regulated materials 
on many sites we are responsible for safety and  accordingly  must implement safety procedures 
if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  our employees and others may become injured 
unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover  increase the cost of a project to our clients  and raise our operating costs 
any of the foregoing could result in financial losses  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials  which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health  safety  and environmental hse work procedures throughout our organization  including construction sites and maintenance sites  the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 
our safety record is critical to our reputation 
many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures 
as a result  our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients  and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business  implement our acquisition strategy  and access our cash and short term investments 
although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations  at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions 
in addition  some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects 
due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad  the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates 
this situation could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and  therefore  utilize our services  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us 
we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors  suppliers  and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets 
if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients  we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are  therefore  subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices 
in weak economic environments  we may experience increased delays 
table of contents and failures due to  among other reasons  a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets 
if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables  it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations 
furthermore  our cash balances and short term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america  europe  and asia 
some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance 
although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership  or have been seized by their governments  there is a risk that this may occur in the future 
if this were to occur  we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 
our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns 
we provide technical  professional  construction  and o m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration  production  and refining  programs for various national governments  including the us federal government  chemicals and polymers  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  infrastructure  buildings  and other  general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and mining and minerals 
these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been  and we expect will continue to be  cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control  including economic conditions and changes in client spending  particularly during periods of economic uncertainty 
current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects 
they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures  alter the mix of services purchased  seek more favorable price and other contract terms  and otherwise slow their spending on our services 
for example  the precipitous increase in crude oil prices followed by their collapse in calendar year caused several of our clients operating in the upstream oil and gas market to re examine a number of their large capital projects  which resulted in delays and cancellations of contracts previously awarded to us 
in the public sector  declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending 
these conditions have reduced the demand for our services  which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 
current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients  our vendors  and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients markets 
in addition  our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and  therefore  may not recover as quickly as the economy at large 
a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regardless of economic or market conditions  investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost 
because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards  we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer s investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation  delays in existing work  or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 
commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways 
for example  for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil  gas  copper  or fertilizers  fluctuations in price can have a direct effect 
table of contents on their profitability and cash flow and  therefore  their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments 
to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects  the demand for our services decreases  which may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects 
rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned  as well as those in progress  and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects 
cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire  retain  and utilize qualified personnel 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire  retain  and utilize qualified personnel  including engineers  architects  designers  craft personnel  and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise 
from time to time  it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients 
in certain geographic areas  for example  we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 
in addition  as some of our key personnel approach retirement age  we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the cost of providing our services  including the extent to which we utilize our workforce  affects our profitability 
for example  the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur cost resulting from excess staff  reductions in staff  or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial conditions  and results of operations 
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors  and vendors presenting claims to us for  among other things  recovery of costs related to certain projects 
similarly  we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients  subcontractors  and vendors 
if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we could incur cost overruns  reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for a project 
additionally  irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders  the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 
we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business 
most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and similar matters 
we can be exposed to claims and litigation if  for example  there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services 
such claims could relate to  among other things  personal injury  loss of life  business interruption  property damage  pollution  and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties  such as those who use or reside near our clients projects 
we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards and those standards are not met 
in many of our contracts with clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages  penalties  losses  and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts 

table of contents we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums 
in addition  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under these programs 
as a result  we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
our insurers are also subject to business risk and  as a result  one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 
pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability  product liability  criminal liability  warranty obligations  and other liabilities which  to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions  and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding 
contracts with the us federal government  for example  are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding 
governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 
as a result  our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice 
since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues those with the us federal government represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements  we must comply with such requirements 
for example  for contracts with the us federal government  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards  the service contract act  and dod security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping  and accounting 
these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and  in some instances  impose additional costs on our business operations 
government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non government contracts 
this includes  for example  unlimited indemnification obligations 
we also are subject to government audits  investigations  and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws 
for example  government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations 
these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 
if we violate a rule or regulation  fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit  a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties 
in addition  any or all of our government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work  or payment of our costs could be disallowed 
the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed price or guaranteed maximum price in nature 
for these contracts  we bear the risk of paying some  if not all  of any cost overruns 
under fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions  including those about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications  or if circumstances change due to  among other things  unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  changes in the costs of raw materials  or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform  then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
if the project is significant  or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects  costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted  cancelled or suspended by our clients and  therefore  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 
additionally  even if fully performed  our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 
as of the end of fiscal  our backlog totaled approximately billion 
there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or  if realized  will result in profits 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  termination  or suspension at the discretion of the client 
in addition  the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts 
our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates 
projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project 
the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide spread economic slowdowns 
additionally  the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence  future profitability 
in some markets  there is a continuing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
typically  our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs  overall safety performance  overall client satisfaction  and other performance criteria 
if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards  we may receive a lower  or even zero  incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog  assuming they produce the revenues currently expected  will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 
our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control 
as is common in the industry  we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures  partnerships  and similar arrangements 
this situation exposes us to a number of risks  including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 
our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships 
if these circumstances occur  we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages  provide additional services  or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
under agreements with joint and several liabilities  we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner 
in these cases  we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture 
in addition  these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow 
to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 
much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third party subcontractors we hire 
we also rely on third party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects 
if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers  our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated  especially in a lump sum or a fixed price contract  we may suffer losses on these contracts 
if a subcontractor  supplier  or manufacturer fails to provide services  supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason  we may be required to source these services  equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated  which could impact contract profitability 
in the current economic environment  third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations 
the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party s ability to provide materials  equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed price contracts 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
historically  we have had adequate bonding capacity but  as is typically the case  the issuance of a bond is at the surety s sole discretion 
in addition  because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity  we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with federal  state  local or foreign governmental requirements  our business may be adversely affected 
we are subject to us federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business 
for example  we are subject to a variety of environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  discharges to air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety 
these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost 
violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 
various us federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or 
table of contents previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities 
these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants 
the liability under these laws is joint and several 
we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties 
the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
when we perform our services  our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions 
we may be subject to liability claims by employees  customers  and third parties as a result of such exposures 
in addition  we may be subject to fines  penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws 
a claim  if not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
such laws  regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  for example  relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment  which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and  in turn  could negatively impact our revenue 
our failure to comply with such laws or regulations  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments  which may require us or our clients to obtain  and to comply with  federal  state  and local government permits and approvals 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
failure to obtain or comply with  or the loss or modification of  the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and result of operations 
our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders 
although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws  the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines  or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges  and could damage our reputation and therefore  our ability to do business 
employee  agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts  which could result in reduced revenues and profits 
misconduct  fraud  non compliance with applicable laws and regulations  or other improper activities by one of our employees  agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation 
such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations  regulations regarding the protection of classified information  regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices  regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts  regulations on lobbying or similar activities  regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting  environmental laws  and any other applicable laws or regulations 
for example  we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters  if a security breach were to occur  our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective  and we could face unknown risks or losses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties  loss of security clearance  and suspension or debarment from contracting  which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 
a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our significant clients  our clients may unilaterally reduce  delay  or cancel their contracts at any time 
our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we engage in a highly competitive business 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition to provide technical  professional  and construction services to clients 
the extent of such competition varies by industry  geographic market  and project type 
for example  with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services  clients generally award large projects to large contractors  which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects 
conversely  with respect to our engineering  design  architectural  and consulting services  low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller  newer competitors 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both  which if significant  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our larger competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel  fluor  foster wheeler  kbr  aker kvaerner  technip  worleyparsons  the shaw group  and amec 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  hok  aecom  and turner 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs  parsons brinckerhoff  hntb  tetra tech  parsons  and ws atkins 
in the area of national government programs  our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic  chm hill  weston  lockheed martin  and computer sciences corporation 
in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors  our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations  and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
at a minimum  our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
in addition  our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including logistical and communication challenges  unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements  lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights  renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts  the adoption of new  and the expansion of existing  trade or other restrictions  embargoes  acts of war  civil unrest  force majeure  and terrorism  the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations  social  political  and economic instability  expropriation of property  tax increases  limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings  and us government policies 
to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic  political and other conditions  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our business strategy involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
acquiring companies presents a number of risks  including difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined  integrated  and efficient business  the effects of diverting management s attention from day to day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies  assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services  and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities  and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions 
acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

table of contents in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make  we could dilute share ownership 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
accordingly  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s on december  if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise  such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors  including fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers  the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter  unanticipated changes in contract performance  particularly with contracts that have funding limits  the timing of resolving change orders  requests for equitable adjustments  and other contract adjustments  delays incurred in connection with a project  weather conditions that delay work at project sites  the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives  natural disasters or other crises  such as the hurricanes affecting oil producing regions like the gulf of mexico  staff levels and utilization rates  changes in prices of services offered by our competitors  and general economic and political conditions 
our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  our management is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the us to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include recognition of contract revenue  costs  profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting  estimated amounts for expected project losses  warranty costs  contract close out or other costs  recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims  collectibility of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts  the amount of reserves necessary for self insured risks  accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation reserves  valuation of assets acquired  and liabilities  goodwill  and intangible assets assumed  in acquisitions  valuation of stock based compensation  and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post retirement benefit programs 

table of contents our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results  which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing it over time 
as of october   we had billion of goodwill  representing of our total assets of billion 
we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 
we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business  potential government actions toward our facilities  and other factors 
if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken 
for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
rising inflation  interest rates  and or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts  in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 
rising inflation  interest rates  or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services 
in addition  we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum price 
because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost reimbursable type contracts approximately during fiscal  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
therefore  increases in inflation  interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us 
in addition  certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions  as well as our shareholder rights agreement  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows  a reader of this management s discussion and analysis md a should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long term engineering and construction type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k  the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule  the cost of materials and labor  productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
in certain instances  we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on all relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

table of contents as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums 
for certain of these joint ventures ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option 
changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option 
the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used at the time of award 
accounting for pension plans the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal ranged from to  this compares to a range of to for fiscal we believe the range of rates we applied for fiscal reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering recent market conditions  projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal these assumptions represent the company s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 
changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material affect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
for example  if the discount rate used to value the our net pension benefit obligation pbo at october  was higher lower by  the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately million  and the net periodic pension cost for fiscal would be lower higher by approximately million 
similarly  if the expected return on plan assets were increased decreased by  the net periodic pension cost for fiscal would decrease increase by approximately million 
differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie  actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap 
management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
contractual guarantees  litigation  investigations  and insurance in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we have elected  however  to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured  and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

table of contents in accordance with us gaap  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees  litigation  and insurance claims 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to the united states federal government and several of its agencies  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 
testing goodwill for possible impairment the goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in performing the annual impairment test  we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  which are based on geography 
we refer to these reporting units internally as europe and non europe 
each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this form k  which includes providing professional technical services such as design  engineering  and architectural services  construction and or construction management services  and maintenance and operations services 
our geography based reporting units reflect the company s organizational structure  which is based predominately on geography  as well as our acquisition strategy  which favors acquisition targets that  among other things  provide access to new geographic areas 
our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheet have been assimilated  and all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 
us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units 
we determined that a market approach is an appropriate method for valuing our reporting units in light of its common use as a technique for valuing businesses in general 
using this method  the fair value of our reporting units was estimated by multiplying their respective after tax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company s overall average market earnings multiple 
since the activities of each reporting unit approximates that of the company overall  we concluded that the use of the company s market multiple for purposes of applying the market based valuation approach was reasonable 
we also believe that the use of this multiple is appropriate considering that both reporting units have qualitative characteristics that are generally consistent with those of the parent company 
those characteristics include size in terms of resources ie  personnel  a large  diverse client base  broad geographic reach  and a broad range of design  engineering  and construction and construction management capabilities 
the determination of reporting units and the selection of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the exercise of judgment by management 
the fair values resulting from the valuation technique used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 
as mentioned above  the key inputs used in the valuation model are the after tax earnings of our reporting units and the company s market driven average earnings multiple 
the multiples used for fiscal   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in the event either the after tax earnings of the company s reporting units or the company s market earnings multiples decline significantly after the date the annual impairment test is performed  the company will re perform the test at a date closer to fiscal year end 
based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests  there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal years and 
table of contents changes in the inputs used in our valuation model ie  declines in the company s average earnings multiple or the after tax earnings of our reporting units could result in an indication of possible impairment of goodwill in the future 
fiscal overview there were two events that occurred during fiscal that significantly affected the comparability of the company s consolidated results of operations for fiscal to its consolidated results of operations for fiscal and the houston sublease in response to the continuing effects brought on by the global recession  the company initiated certain cost reduction measures during fiscal as part of those measures  we ceased using one of our offices located in houston  texas  and entered into a sublease for the entire property 
this transaction occurred in the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  included in net earnings for fiscal is a pre tax charge of million relating to this real estate transaction 
net of the effects on the company s incentive bonus plan and income taxes  the houston sublease resulted in a net  after tax charge of million  or per diluted share 
the sivom judgment during the third quarter of fiscal  we received an unfavorable court judgment relating to a waste incineration project in france for the sivom de mulhousienne sivom 
the sivom project was performed by a consortium of contractors that was led by one of our subsidiaries under a contract that was entered into in  prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary 
as a result of the judgment  we recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million 
included in this amount is a million write off of a claim receivable 
the balance of the charge reflects the cash payments the company made to the sivom  net of cash payments the company received 
net of the effects of the charge on the company s long term incentive bonus plan and income taxes  the effect on net earnings attributable to jacobs was approximately million  or per diluted share 
in this md a  we discuss and analyze the company s results of operations for fiscal before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment 
although such information is non us gaap in nature  it is presented because management believes it provides a better view of the company s operating results for the readers of this annual report on form k to assess the company s performance and operating trends 

table of contents the following table presents i the company s consolidated results of operations for fiscal before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment which is non us gaap  ii the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom litigation  and iii the company s consolidated results of operations for fiscal in accordance with us gaap in thousands  except earnings per share fiscal consolidated results of operations before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment fiscal consolidated results of operations us gaap revenues costs and expenses direct costs of contracts selling  general and administrative expenses operating profit other income expense interest income interest expense miscellaneous expense  net total other income expense  net earnings loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss of the group net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net earnings loss attributable to jacobs net earnings loss per share diluted the company s operating results for fiscal continue to be impacted by the global recession which began affecting the company during the first quarter of fiscal the recession has caused many of our private sector clients to re examine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects  and  in certain instances  cancellations of projects awarded to us previously 
these economic conditions have also had a negative effect on many of our public sector clients as we have seen spending reductions by federal and state governments and the delay and curtailment of key infrastructure programs 
the decline in revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal occurred in most of the industries and markets we serve 
with respect to the various categories of services we provide  the decline in revenues was more prevalent in the field services area of our business  and reflects the general decrease during the year in the amount of pass through costs we incurred on our projects 
as discussed in last year s md a  we implemented certain cost control measures last year in response to the effects of the recession 
we reduced personnel and closed or re configured a number of our offices 
the results of these actions contributed to a million reduction in selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses 
although we continue to look for opportunities to reduce or minimize our operating costs  there is no guaranty that we will be able to identify additional opportunities and make further reductions 
on the other hand  we are a very diversified business 
we provide a wide range of services to customers operating in a wide range of industries and markets 
accordingly  we continue to believe that as the global economy begins to recover  and depending on which industries and markets start their recovery first  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on whatever increased capital spending occurs  both domestically and 
table of contents internationally 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  our debt to equity ratio was at the end of fiscal  and we have over million available under our various credit facilities 
results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing  analysis  and consulting activities  construction services which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities  and includes direct hire construction and construction management services  and operations and maintenance services which includes services performed in connection with operating large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete single responsibility  design build contracts  to services required in the post start up phases of a project such as maintenance and operations services 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands a technical professional services revenues project services process  scientific  and systems consulting total technical professional services revenues field services revenues construction a operations and maintenance o m total field services revenues a before the effects of the sivom judgment 

table of contents we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets 
we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands a refining downstream b national government programs c chemicals and polymers infrastructure buildings c pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil gas upstream industrial and other a b a before the effects of the sivom judgment 
b beginning in fiscal  the industry group formerly called energy refining downstream has been renamed refining downstream  and revenues relating to projects for customers in the power industry have been reclassified to the category industrial and other 
industrial and other now includes revenues from projects for our clients operating in the power  technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and basic resources industries  among others 
prior period information has been reclassified to conform to this new presentation 
c beginning in fiscal  revenues relating to buildings projects performed for the us federal government have been reclassified from the national government programs industry group to the buildings market 
prior period information has been reclassified to conform to this new presentation fiscal before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended october   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal revenues for the fiscal year ended october  totaled billion  and represents a decrease of billion  or  as compared to billion for fiscal revenues during fiscal from projects for clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve were significantly lower as compared to fiscal the larger decreases occurred in the refining downstream  oil gas upstream  and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry groups and markets 
these declines relate to the normal winding down and completion of large projects  combined with the lack of new project awards 
these industry groups and markets have also been significantly impacted by the global recession  causing many clients to re examine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects  and  in certain instances  cancellations of projects awarded to us previously 
also contributing to the decline in revenues within these industry groups and markets was a billion  or  decrease in pass through costs discussed below 
in contrast  revenues during fiscal from projects for national government program clients increased by million  or  as compared to last year 
most of the increase relates to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering  scientific  other technical services projects 

table of contents similarly  revenues during fiscal relating to buildings projects increased by million  or  as compared to last year 
the increase relates to spending for the design of technical buildings 
for the fiscal year we earned million in revenues for projects funded by the american recovery and reinvestment act of direct costs of contracts for fiscal decreased billion  or  to billion  compared to billion for fiscal the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass through costs we incur during a period 
on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as pass through costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not considered pass through costs and are  therefore  not reflected in either revenues or costs 
to the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass through costs in a period  our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 
pass through costs for fiscal decreased billion  or  to billion  compared to billion for fiscal in general  pass through costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities 
field services revenues for fiscal decreased billion  or  to billion  compared to billion for fiscal pass through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients projects 
however  because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year  the effect of pass through costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
generally speaking  the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie  where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects  and or procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical  professional services revenues  the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues 
because revenues from pass through costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily to lower levels of pass through costs 
sg a expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal our sg a expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in head count and the amount of spending required to support our technical professional services activities  which normally require additional overhead costs 
therefore  when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease  it is not unusual to see a corresponding change in sg a expenses 
the decrease in sg a expenses during fiscal was due primarily to management s efforts to reduce sg a expenses 
operating profit for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease in operating profit is due primarily to the overall decline in business volume 
interest income for fiscal decreased by million  to million  compared to million for fiscal even though the company maintained significant cash balances during fiscal  the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in as compared to fiscal 
table of contents interest expense for fiscal was nearly zero compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the reversal of million of interest expense that was accrued over the past several years in connection with an income tax matter that was resolved successfully in fiscal the company s consolidated effective income tax rate was for fiscal unchanged from fiscal in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september determined on the basis of the number of workdays and  accordingly  an additional week of activity is added every five to six years  such as in fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended october   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal although consolidated revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  most of the increase occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal as the company completed a number of projects for clients operating in several of the industries and markets we serve 
during the second half of fiscal  as the global economy continued to slow  revenues dropped off significantly  while project delays increased and awards of new contracts also slowed 
revenues during fiscal from projects for clients operating in the refining downstream and the oil gas upstream industries increased a total of million  or  from fiscal all of the increase related to projects for clients operating in the energy refinery sector and reflects the ramping up of work performed at a large  us oil refinery 
this increase was off set in part by the winding down of work on certain projects in the upstream sector of the petroleum market that were awarded to the company in prior years when oil prices were at historically high levels 
revenues during fiscal from projects for national government program clients increased by million  or  from fiscal most of the increase continues to relate to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering  scientific  and other technical services 
although the company performed services during fiscal for projects that were funded in part under the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  such revenues were not significant 
revenues during fiscal from projects for clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries  and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries as well as the buildings market all declined as compared to fiscal  as clients reviewed their capital expenditure plans in light of the global recession and delayed the release of new projects 
direct costs of contracts for fiscal increased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for fiscal the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass through cost we incur during a period 
on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as pass through costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these 
table of contents amounts are not considered pass through costs and are  therefore  not reflected in either revenues or costs 
to the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass through costs in a period  our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well

the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher levels of pass through costs combined with a slight decrease in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
sg a expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to billion for fiscal our sg a expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in head count and the spending required to support our technical professional services revenues  which normally require additional overhead costs 
therefore  when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease  we typically see a corresponding change in sg a expenses

operating profit for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease in operating profit is due primarily to the overall decline in business volume  and in particular  the decrease in project services revenues 
interest income for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal even though the company maintained higher average cash balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in as compared to fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal as compared to fiscal miscellaneous expense  net for fiscal totaled million as compared to miscellaneous income  net of million for fiscal included in miscellaneous income  net in fiscal was a million gain from the sale of the company s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities 
by excluding the gain from fiscal  miscellaneous expense  net for fiscal would have been million 

table of contents we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate in fiscal was the same as fiscal contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands payments due by fiscal period total year or less years years more than years debt obligations operating leases a obligations under defined benefit pension plans b obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans c purchase obligations d total a assumes the company will make end of lease term residual value guarantee payments of million in and million in with respect to the lease of two office buildings in houston  texas 
b assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of october  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
c assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of october  d represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of october  backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
with respect to o m contracts  however  we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for national government programs other than us federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  excluding option periods 
the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions technical professional services field services total because the entire value of a contract is added to backlog as soon as the contract is awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time  and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years  we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis  rather than on a sequential  quarter over quarter basis 
our backlog at october  decreased by billion  or  to billion from billion at october  
table of contents in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  adjustments were made to a variety of extended term  task order  indefinite quantity  and other similar contracts where it became clear that the full capacity of the previously recorded backlog amount would not be realized 
such negative adjustments totaled approximately million and affected technical professional services 
during fiscal  approximately billion was removed from backlog as a result of project cancellations 
approximately billion was removed from backlog during fiscal relating to cancelled projects 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 
backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately billion or of total backlog  billion or of total backlog  and billion or of total backlog at october   october   and september   respectively 
most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
subject to the factors discussed in item a risk factors  above  we estimate that approximately billion  or  of total backlog at october  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in detail in item a risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources the three more significant and or nonrecurring uses of cash during fiscal was approximately million for acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired approximately million more than what was spent for acquisitions during fiscal  approximately million for purchases of investments approximately million more than what was spent for investments during fiscal  and approximately million representing the net cash outflow relating to the sivom judgment 
in spite of the million of cash used for these transactions and events  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by only million during fiscal this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during fiscal  and a decrease of million during fiscal during fiscal  we generated net cash inflows of million from operating activities and million from financing activities 
these inflows were offset in part by outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of million and million  respectively 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the following factors a million decrease relating to changes in our working capital accounts discussed below  and  a million decrease in net earnings 
with respect to the million decrease in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts  there was no unusual activity occurring in these accounts during fiscal because such a high 
table of contents percentage of our revenues are earned on cost plus type contracts and of total revenues for fiscal years and  respectively  and due to the significance of revenues relating to pass through costs  most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients 
although we continually monitor our accounts receivable  we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total  rather than by the individual elements 
the primary elements of the company s working capital accounts are accounts receivable  accounts payable  and billings in excess of cost 
accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients 
receivable consist of amounts owed to us by our clients a substantial portion of which is for project related costs 
billings in excess of costs consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 
this relationship between revenues and costs  and between receivables and payables is unique for our industry  and facilitates reviews of cash flow information at the total working capital level 
the million decrease in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts was due primarily to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts  and reflects the general decline of the overall business in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
we used million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal was due primarily to acquisitions of businesses and changes in investments 
during fiscal we acquired jordan  jones goulding  inc and tybrin corporation  and we completed our investment in awe management limited 
our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million during fiscal and net cash inflows of million during fiscal the million net increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an million change in the company s borrowing activities along with a million change in other deferred liabilities relating primarily to the company s defined benefit pension plans 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the next twelve months 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at october   compared to billion at october  our consolidated working capital position at october  was billion  compared to billion at october   which management believes is adequate 
we have a long term  unsecured  revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity  under which approximately million was utilized at october  in the form of letters of credit only 
we also have a short term credit facility in place at october  providing million of debt capacity  which was entirely utilized as of that date 
we believe that the capacity  terms and conditions of our committed credit facilities  combined with other uncommitted facilities we have in place  are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 
depending on the size of any business acquisition we complete in the future and the timing of when any such transaction may close  our current cash balances and existing credit facilities may not be sufficient to provide the amount of liquidity we may need 
we believe  however  that we will be able to access the capital markets and fund future acquisitions if and when the need arises 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business 
however  such off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only committed source for long term credit is a million syndicated revolving credit facility 
there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility at october  this agreement expires in 
table of contents may  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we continuously monitor changes in interest rates  and use cash provided from operations to re pay our borrowings as quickly as possible 
furthermore  the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency  we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies  we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies 
we follow the provisions of asc in accounting for our derivative contracts 
the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations
