item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bank holding company for plumas bank  a california state chartered commercial bank 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related  commercial and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating in california  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in california  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the bank s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
one of our strategic objectives is to expand our banking service activities to adjacent communities 
in october  we opened a new bank owned branch in truckee  california 
this replaced a much smaller leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of we opened a commercial real estate loan office in reno  nevada 
during the second quarter of we opened a branch in redding  california and during the fourth quarter of we opened a government guaranteed lending office in auburn  california 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans 
we determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  primarily on an analysis of the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
we segment the loan portfolio into as many components as practical 
each component has similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 
we cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio  which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established 
other real estate owned 
other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo is charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 

table of contents subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
income taxes 
the company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary 
the allocation of income tax expense benefit represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
stock based compensation 
compensation cost is recognized for all stock based awards that vest subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate since the grant date fair value is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which involves making estimates of the assumptions used  including the expected term of the option  expected volatility over the option term  expected dividend yield over the option term and risk free interest rate 
in addition  when determining the compensation expense to amortize over the vesting period  management makes estimates about the expected forfeiture rate of options 
the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital 
it pertains to the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein 
overview our company has been affected by an economic downturn unprecedented in recent memory 
primarily related to significant declines in real estate values our provision for loan losses increased by million and we experienced a million increase in the provision for oreo losses 
these items along with an thousand decrease in net interest income  an thousand increase in fdic insurance premiums and a million increase in other items of non interest expense were partially offset by a million increase in non interest income

table of contents as a result of the declining rate environment interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to rate decreases on time deposits and  to a lesser extent  rate decreases on interest bearing transaction accounts  savings and money market deposits  short term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures 
the decrease in expense related to declining rates was slightly offset by increases in the average balances of interest bearing demand deposits and short term borrowings 
for the year ended december  compared to  the company s average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to from

table of contents interest on investment securities decreased by thousand  as a slight increase in yield of basis points was offset by a decline in the average balance of investment securities of million 
the increase in rate during primarily relates to scheduled repayments of lower rate securities 
interest on federal funds sold declined by thousand related both to a decline in the average balance outstanding and a decline in the average rate earned 
as a result of the declining rate environment interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to rate decreases on time deposits and interest bearing demand deposits and  to a lesser extent  rate decreases on savings deposits  short term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures 
during  rather than increasing the rates paid on our lower cost interest bearing transaction  money market and savings accounts to attract deposits and thereby increasing the rate paid on the entire balance of these accounts  the company chose to increase its level of time deposits by offering certain short term promotional certificates of deposit which paid a higher rate than our standard time deposits 
during we allowed these higher rate promotional time deposits to mature and increased our level of short term borrowings which offered favorable interest rates in comparison to rates we would have had to pay to attract additional time deposits 
for the year ended december  compared to  the company s average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to from 
this decrease includes a decline in market rates in the company s service area and the effect of our discontinuing the promotional certificate of deposit program

as a result of the changes noted above  the net interest margin for decreased basis points to  from for provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of the loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
in response to an increase in the level of net loan charge offs and our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in the current economic environment  particularly related to the decline in real estate values  we increased our provision for loan losses 
net charge offs totaled million during  however million of this amount was related to construction and land development loans 
the construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by management as a higher risk loan category 
the quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the company has securing the loan in the event of default 
loans in 
table of contents this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
management relies heavily on recent loss experience in determining risk in the category which it believes provides a more accurate gauge of actual risk given the negative trends in the current economic cycle 
real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy 
the company has significantly reduced its exposure to these loans as demonstrated by a decline in loan balances in this portfolio of million from million at december  to million at december  the provision for loan losses increased from thousand during to million during and was million during the year ended december  the company has increased its level of allowance for loan losses to total loans from at december  to at december  and has increased its allowance for loan losses from million to million for the same periods 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased to for from for and for net charge offs on construction and land developments loans as a percentage of average loans increased to for from for the company has made progress  during  in decreasing its level of nonperforming loans 
after increasing from million at december  to million at december  nonperforming loans declined to million at december based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio 
however  no assurance can be given that the company may not sustain charge offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period

the increase in loan sale gains include an increase in loans sold from million during the year ended december  to million during  increases in the market price of sba guaranteed loans and an increase  during  in the percentage of each loan that is guaranteed by the sba 
partially offsetting these increases in income were declines in service charges  investment services income  official check fees and fhlb dividends 
service charge income decreased by thousand related to a decrease in nsf overdraft income 
investment services income decreased by thousand  however  the company offset this decrease by a decrease in staffing dedicated to this department 
the company attributes these decreases primarily to the economic conditions present during official checks fees declined by thousand 
official checks fees represent fees paid by a third party processor for the processing of our cashier and expense checks 
these fees are indexed to the federal funds rate and the decrease in income from this item is primarily related to the decline in the federal funds rate during additionally  during the processor changed the fee structure further reducing fees that we earn under this relationship 
the fhlb paid only one dividend totaling thousand during compared to four quarterly dividends totaling thousand during compared to during  total non interest income decreased by thousand or  to million  down from million from the comparable period in this decrease was primarily related to a write down on a security issued by lehman brothers holdings inc due to the significant decline in the price of this security following its bankruptcy filing the company recorded an other than temporary impairment write down of thousand 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in service charges and gains on loan sales 
service charge income increased by thousand primarily related to an increase in monthly service charges on non interest bearing transaction accounts 
gains on the sale of loans  which increased by thousand  relate to the sale of sba government guaranteed loans and reflects an increase in staffing levels in our government guaranteed lending operations 
partially offsetting these items were decreases in official check fees  loan servicing fees and investment services income 
official checks fees declined by thousand 
official checks fees represent fees paid by a third party processor for the processing of our cashier and expense checks 
these fees are indexed to the federal funds rate and the decrease in income from this item is primarily related to the decline in the federal funds rate during additionally  during the processor changed the fee structure further reducing fees that we earn under this relationship 
smaller decreases were experienced in loan servicing income which declined by thousand and investment services revenue which declined thousand

other significant increases included thousand in salaries and employee benefits  thousand in outside service fees  thousand in professional fees  thousand in loan collection costs  thousand in oreo costs  thousand in losses on the sale of oreo and thousand in other expense 
these items were partially offset by reductions in other costs  the three largest of which where advertising and shareholder relations  business development and insurance expense 
a valuation allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained to provide for declines in value 
the provision for oreo losses for the year ended december  totaled million which represents significant declines in the value of several properties 
at december  oreo consisted of twenty nine properties with a total fair value  which includes a million valuation allowance  of million 
at december  oreo consisted of nineteen properties with a fair value of million 
during the fdic increased regular assessments and implemented a special assessment resulting in a significant increase in fdic assessments 
additionally  during the first quarter of the company was able to use its remaining credit balance with the fdic to offset insurance premium billings  however  by the end of the first quarter of the credit balance had been fully utilized 
the company is currently forecasting elevated fdic insurance premiums for next several years 

table of contents salaries and other employee benefits increased by thousand primarily related to a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs 
salary expense increased by thousand as an increase in salary expense of thousand related to our government guaranteed lending operations was mostly offset by reductions in staffing in other areas including our reno loan production office and our branch network 
related to a decrease in loan production  the deferral of loan origination cost  which reduces salary and benefits cost  declined by thousand 
during the fourth quarter of the company outsourced the oversight of its computer network  resulting in a reduction in information technology staffing 
the cost of this outsourcing is included in the increase in outside services fees 
in addition  during we implemented an outsourced online banking product which also increased outside service fees 
consistent with the increase in nonperforming loans and assets during the period see the section analysis of asset quality and allowance for loan losses loan collection costs and oreo expenses increased by thousand 
oreo costs which include the cost of holding and maintaining foreclosed real estate increased by thousand to thousand while loan collection costs increased by thousand to thousand 
losses incurred on the sale of oreo totaled thousand and relate to the sale of nine properties 
proceeds received on sale of these properties totaled million 
the increase in other expense  which totaled thousand  is primarily related to nonrecurring expense items  the largest of which totaled thousand 
we implemented cost control initiatives which  among other things  have resulted in savings in advertising  shareholder relation costs and business development costs 
these cost savings totaled thousand during when compared to we reduced our shareholder expense by eliminating the glossy section of our annual report 
business development costs declined as we reduced certain employee travel and relationship building initiatives which generated an annual savings of approximately thousand 
during the first quarter of our chief information and technology officer retired from the company 
because his retirement took place prior to the age of sixty five he forfeited his benefits under his company provided split dollar life insurance plan 
to reflect this forfeiture we recorded a one time reduction in insurance expense totaling thousand 
compared to during  total non interest expense increased thousand  or  to million  up from million for the comparable period in the increase in non interest expense was primarily the result of increases in occupancy and equipment costs  loan expenses  fdic insurance costs and the provision for oreo losses 
these items were partially offset by declines in salaries and employee benefits  reductions in professional fees  business development and advertising costs  and a reduction in core deposit intangible amortization 
the largest single factor resulting in the increase in non interest expense was a thousand provision for losses on oreo 
we experienced a decline in the fair value of our foreclosed real estate holdings and to reflect this decline we established a valuation allowance for these properties through the recording of a thousand provision for losses on oreo properties 
the increase in occupancy and equipment costs primarily relates to costs associated with our redding  california branch 
we initially opened this branch in a small temporary facility and in july we relocated to our much larger permanent leased facility which is located in redding s commercial district  across the street from city hall 
consistent with the increase in nonperforming loans and assets during the period loan collection costs increased by thousand to thousand and oreo expenses increased by thousand from thousand during to thousand for the year ended december  fdic insurance expense increased by thousand 
during the company was able to use its remaining credit balance with the fdic to offset insurance premium billings  however by the end of the first quarter of the credit balance had been fully utilized 

table of contents salaries and employee benefit expenses decreased thousand  or  from the year ended december  the largest components of this decrease were a thousand decline in salary continuation plan expense and a thousand decline in bonus expense 
these items were partially offset by an increase in salary expense of thousand 
the company provides retirement benefits to its executive officers in the form of salary continuation plans and split dollar life insurance agreements 
the purpose of these agreements is to provide a special incentive to the experienced executive officer to continue employment with the company on a long term basis 
these costs were abnormally high during as they included a one time expense of thousand reflecting the announced early retirement of our chief information technology officer 
the decline in bonus expense is consistent with a decline in net income during the period as a significant portion of our bonus plans are tied to or directly influenced by the level of net income including return on average equity  return on average assets and earnings per share 
the decline in net income during the period resulted in an absence of bonuses earned from this portion of our bonus plans 
bonus expense recorded for was related to factors not directly related to net income such as loan production and deposit growth 
salaries costs increased by thousand which included annual merit increases as well as expansion of our government guaranteed lending activities and an increase in staffing levels at our redding  california branch 
we have focused our attention on cost control initiatives and have been successful in several areas 
we reduced professional fees by thousand and reduced business development and advertising costs by thousand 
during the period professional fees included consulting costs associated with an outside evaluation of our core banking software requirements  other technology planning costs and costs associated with a strategic planning initiative 
similar costs were not incurred during the period 
the decrease in business development and advertising costs resulted from reductions in our marketing budget  promotional materials  and a decrease in seminar and conference costs 
core deposit intangible amortization declined by thousand as a portion of this asset is now fully amortized 
the remaining asset is scheduled to amortize at the rate of thousand per year until october  provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  or of pre tax loss for the year ended december  during the company recorded an income tax benefit of thousand as tax exempt income exceeded pretax income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings  which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors 
the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
more likely than not is defined as greater than a chance 
all available evidence  both positive and negative is considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
as part of its analysis  the company considered the following positive evidence the company s net loss was largely attributable to losses on its construction and land development portfolio that represented approximately of net charge offs during the year ended december  this portfolio has significantly decreased during the current year and the company is not growing the portfolio 

table of contents the company s net loss was also attributable to large write downs in construction and land development real estate owned which represented the majority of its provision for losses on other real estate during given that the construction and land development reo is valued significantly below the original appraised value as of december   management does not anticipate significant additional declines in future periods 
the company has a long history of earnings profitability 
the company is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations 
the size of loan credits in the company s pipeline of potential problem loans has significantly decreased 
as part of its analysis  the company considered the following negative evidence the company recorded a large net loss in and is in a cumulative loss position for the current and preceding two years 
the company did not meet its financial projections in or based upon our analysis of available evidence  we have determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of december  and will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded 
financial condition loan portfolio 
the company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves 
although the company offers a broad array of financing options  it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses 
these commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses  thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property  business assets and deposit accounts  but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment 
the company s largest lending categories are real estate mortgage loans  consumer and real estate construction and land development loans 
these categories accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december   and approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december  the construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by management as a higher risk loan category 
the quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the company has securing the loan in the event of default 
loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
the decline in these loans as a percentage of the company s loan portfolio reflects management s efforts to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans in due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market

the company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies 
the company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews 
the company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis  or more frequently as loan conditions change 
the board of directors  through the loan committee  reviews the asset quality of new and criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board of directors 
in management s opinion  this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans 

table of contents the company has implemented a management asset resolution committee marc to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans 
it consists of members of executive management  credit administration management and the board of directors  and the activities are governed by a formal written charter 
the marc meets semi monthly and reports to the board s loan committee 
more specifically  a formal plan to effect repayment and or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on going oversight by the marc

related to the severe economic downturn and the resulting decline in real estate values the company s charge offs increased dramatically during net charge offs during the year ended december  totaled  thousand  or of average loans  compared to  thousand  or of average loans for and thousand  or of average loans for the allowance for loan losses stood at of total loans as of december   versus of total loans as of december  the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans  including current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  collateral  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent credit reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and state of the local economy 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company follows these guidelines 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that 
table of contents affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in addition  the company incorporates the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which represents the sec staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements  which include but are not limited to specific allocation determined in accordance with asc topic receivables formerly fas  accounting for impairment of a loan based on probable losses on specific loans 
general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 
specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified  impaired  and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question 
for purposes of this analysis  classified loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful 
loans classified as loss are immediately charged off 
formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the formula allocation analysis incorporates loan losses over the past seven years adjusted for changes in the business cycle 
loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the estimated loss exposure resulting from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
the discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 

table of contents the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity 
at december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs during the period to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  is attributable to a million increase in specific reserves related to impaired loans from by million at december  to million at december  and a million increase in general reserves 
general reserves totaled million at december  and million at december  as a percentage of total loans general reserves increased from at december  to at december  charge offs totaled million of which million was related to our real estate construction and land development portfolio 
we do not expect a similar level of losses in because in we dealt aggressively with our problem real estate loans as evidenced by a decrease in nonperforming loans from million at december  to million at december  in addition  we reduced our exposure to construction and land development loans as our construction and land development portfolio decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  as a result  we currently anticipate that charge offs could range from approximately million to million in  the largest part of which are anticipated to be related to real estate loans and consistent with activity within the real estate category most of the charge offs are expected to be associated with construction and land development loans 
for other categories of loans we expect charge offs to be similar to activity 
however  given the lack of stability in the real estate market and the recent volatility in charge offs  there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not increase or decrease from this estimate 
the company places loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement

for the years ended december   and  the company recognized thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  of income on such loans 
interest foregone on impaired loans totaled thousand thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  is appropriate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods 
oreo represents real property taken by the bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower

obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal securities provide attractive tax equivalent yields for the company 
since the majority of the interest earnings on these securities are not taxable for federal purposes the investment in municipal securities results in a reduction in the effective tax rate of the company

the company transferred its municipal obligations to the available for sale category on december  as it no longer has the intention to hold these securities until maturity
