item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with our md a in its entirety 
the national economy remained in a recession throughout most of  with continued weakness in the housing and real estate markets and rising unemployment 
during the year ended december   job losses totaled million and the unemployment rate increased to for december although there was continued weakness in the economy during the fourth quarter  the year ended december  has shown a gradual improvement over the fourth quarter  during which time the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets reached a crisis level as national and global credit markets ceased to function effectively 
concern for the stability of the banking and financial systems reached a magnitude which resulted in unprecedented government intervention including  but not limited to  the passage of the eesa and the implementation of the cpp  the tlgp  the cpff  the cap  the scap and the ppip  which are described in greater detail in item a  risk factors 
the fomc responded with monetary stimulus as well 
the fomc reduced the federal funds rate by basis points in  bringing the target rate to to  where it remained through december  for further discussion on the economy and recent government actions  see item  business regulation and supervision and item a  risk factors 
as the premier long island community bank  our goals are to enhance shareholder value while building a solid banking franchise 
we focus on growing our core businesses of mortgage portfolio lending and retail banking while maintaining strong asset quality and controlling operating expenses 
we also provide returns to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases although we have currently suspended our stock repurchase program and reduced our dividend to preserve capital and increase our capital ratios during this period of widespread economic distress 
total assets decreased during the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in our loan and securities portfolios 
the decrease in our loan portfolio was primarily due to decreases in our one to four family and multi family mortgage loan portfolios  resulting from repayments outpacing origination and purchase volume 
repayments remained at elevated levels as interest rates on thirty year fixed rate mortgages remained at historic lows and more loans in our portfolio qualified under the expanded conforming loan limits and were refinanced into fixed rate mortgages 
during the second quarter  in response to declining customer demand for adjustable rate products  we began originating and retaining for portfolio jumbo fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans 
the decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily the result of cash flow from repayments and sales exceeding securities purchased 
total deposits decreased during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in certificates of deposit and liquid cds  partially offset by increases in savings  money market and now and demand deposit accounts 
the increases in low cost savings  money market and now and demand deposit accounts reflect the decrease in competition for core community deposits  from that which we experienced during deposits decreased during the latter half of as we reduced our focus on certificates of deposit to offset the impact of accelerated prepayment activity in our loan and securities portfolios 
cash flows from mortgage loan and securities repayments  coupled with deposit growth during the first half of  in excess of mortgage loan originations and purchases and securities purchases enabled us to repay a portion of our matured borrowings during the first half of  which resulted in a decrease in our borrowings portfolio from december  net income for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to increases in the provision for loan losses and non interest expense  partially offset by a decrease in otti charges and an increase in net interest income 
during  we continued to be affected by the continued weakness in the housing and real estate markets and overall economy  particularly the high unemployment rate 
as a primarily residential lender  we are vulnerable to the impact of a severe job loss recession  due to its negative impact on the financial condition of residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans 
as a result  we experienced an increase in loan delinquencies  causing a decrease in our interest income  as well as an adverse impact on our loan loss experience  reflected in an increase in our charge offs  allowance for loan losses and related provision 
net interest income  the net interest margin and the net interest rate spread for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the cost of interest bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest earning assets 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in the average costs of our certificates of deposit and liquid cds and decreases in the average balances of borrowings and liquid cds  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in the average yields on our interest earning assets  primarily one to four family mortgage loans due in part to increases in our non performing loans  and decreases in the average balances of mortgage backed and other securities and multi family  commercial real estate and construction loans  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of one to four family mortgage loans 
the provision for loan losses recorded during the year ended december  reflects the increase in and composition of our loan delinquencies  non performing loans and net loan charge offs  as well as our evaluation of the continued weakness in the housing and real estate markets and overall economy  particularly the high unemployment rate 
non interest income increased primarily due to the decrease in otti charges  coupled with increases in gain on sales of securities and mortgage banking income  net  partially offset by decreases in income from boli  customer service fees and other non interest income 
during the first quarter  we recorded a million otti charge to write off the remaining cost basis of our investment in two issues of freddie mac perpetual preferred securities 
during the third quarter  we recorded a million otti charge to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in the freddie mac perpetual preferred securities to the securities market values totaling million at september  see critical accounting policies securities impairment for a further discussion of these otti charges 
the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a significant increase in regular fdic insurance premiums  the million fdic special assessment and an increase in compensation and benefits expense  primarily pension expense  partially offset by decreases in occupancy  equipment and systems expense and advertising expense 
despite high unemployment and a weak housing market  we continue to remain cautiously optimistic as the economy begins to show signs of improvement 
in the near term  as a result of the us government s efforts to keep residential mortgage rates artificially low coupled with the expanded conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in  loan prepayments will remain high and restrain loan and balance sheet growth 
if and when these government programs subside  mortgage rates should return to normal market levels and we should resume loan and balance sheet growth at reasonable spreads 
with respect to the net interest margin  we expect modest increases in the first half of as we continue to realize the benefit from significant certificate of deposit repricing opportunities
