the acquisition gives the company the ability to continue its expansion of its third party management and leasing capabilities throughout the united states 
this acquisition is expected to result in a significant change in the company s operations 
as discussed in item  it has caused the company to increase its employees from to critical accounting policies the major accounting policies followed by the company are listed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements investment in real estate assets rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the useful lives are as follows

building and improvements to years tenant improvements term of the related lease furniture and equipment to years impairment of real estate assets the company evaluates its real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying accounts may not be recoverable 
if such an evaluation is considered necessary  the company compares the carry amount of that real estate asset with the expected undiscounted cash flows  exclusive of interest on related debt  that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
the company s estimate of the expected future cash flow used in testing for impairment is based on  among other things  its estimates regarding future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is  therefore  subjective by nature 
these assumptions could differ materially from actually results 
if the company s strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
to the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carry value of the asset to its fair value 

table of contents the determination of the fair value of real estate is also highly subjective  especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions 
the company primarily utilizes the income approach to estimate the fair value of its income producing real estate assets 
to the extent that the assumptions used in testing long lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant  the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured 
in addition to determining future cash flows  which make the estimation of a real estate asset s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective  the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective 
allocation of purchase price of acquired assets upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities  and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases 
the company evaluates acquired above and below market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
sales of real estate assets gains on property sales are recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided i the gain is determinable  that is  the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and ii the earnings process is virtually complete  that is  the company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the gain 
losses on property sales are recognized immediately 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
the company has assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that the company considered are that future anticipated property sales will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset  taxable income projections in future years  and whether the carryfoward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits 
the company has incurred taxable losses for each of the two years ended december  and historically  the company has incurred taxable losses in years in which it does not sell any real estate assets for gains 
no properties were sold during  however  partial interests in two consolidated limited partnerships were sold in  each of which owns a property 
the company expects to sell real estate assets in the future and has determined that it was more likely than not that future taxable income  primarily from gains on the sales of real estate assets  will be sufficient to enable it to realize all of its deferred tax assets 
therefore  for each of the two years ended december   no valuation allowance has been recorded

net cash used in investing activities amounted to  for the year ended december  cash of  was used to acquire one office property 
in addition  cash of  was used for capital expenditures  primarily tenant improvements 
this amount was reduced by proceeds of  received from the sale of columbia

this amount was reduced by the repayment of borrowings on the sale of columbia of  scheduled principal payments of  and other principal repayments of  the current credit crisis  related turmoil in the global financial system and the downturn in the united states economy has had an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the continuation of the credit crisis and or the downturn in the economy has adversely affected the company s business in a number of ways  including effects on its ability to obtain new mortgages  to refinance current debt and to sell properties 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements for normal operating expenses from cash generated by operations 
in addition  the company anticipates generating proceeds from borrowing activities  property sales and or equity offerings to provide funds for payments of certain accounts payables  consisting primarily of tenant improvements and capital improvements on properties 
as of december   amounts in accounts payable over days totaled  of which  was related to hurricane ike expenses  the evergreen acquisition and other business development costs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced its total accounts payable balance by approximately  also  the company expects to incur capital costs related to leasing space and making improvements to properties provided the estimated leasing of space is completed 
the company anticipates meeting these obligations with the use of funds held in escrow by lenders  proceeds from property sales  if necessary  and borrowing activities 
there can be no assurance  however  that these activities will occur 
if these activities do no occur  the company will not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations 
the company has loans totaling  maturing over the next twelve months 
one of these loans  with a balance of  as of december   contains two one year extension options 
the extension options are contingent upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions required by the lender 
the company believes it will be able to meet the extension criteria for this loan 
most of the company s mortgage debt is not cross collateralized 
the company has three mortgage loans that are cross collateralized by a second property 
it is common for the company to serve as a guarantor and or indemnitor on its mortgage debt 
because of uncertainties caused by the current credit crisis  the company s current debt level and the company s historical losses there can be no assurances as to the company s ability to obtain funds necessary for the refinancing of its maturing debts 
if refinancing transactions are not consummated  the company will seek extensions and or modifications from existing lenders 
if these refinancings or extensions do not occur  the company will not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations 
the company is not in compliance with a debt covenant on a mortgage loan secured by one of its office properties located in houston  texas 
the debt covenant requires the company to maintain a minimum tangible book net worth as defined in the debt agreement 
in the event the lender elects to take any action with respect to this matter  the company will attempt to negotiate a revision to the loan covenant 
if a refinance of the loan becomes necessary  the company believes it could obtain a new mortgage loan for an amount in excess of the current debt balance and prepayment costs associated with the current loan 
funds from operations the company believes that funds from operations ffo is a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance 
the company computed ffo in accordance with standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a 
table of contents measure of performance of the company because  along with cash flow from operating activities  ffo provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operations  as defined by gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands

inflation substantially all of the leases at the industrial and retail center properties provide for pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustment and pass through of increases in operating expenses during the term of the lease 
all of these provisions may permit the company to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and therefore  serve to reduce the company s exposure to the adverse effects of inflation
