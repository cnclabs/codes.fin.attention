the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
company overview in  we strengthened our organization and talent base  made improvements to our capital structure  expanded our international presence  accelerated our lean initiatives and executed aggressive cost reduction actions 
our financial results reflect weak conditions in our markets served  lower commodity prices and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  to which we responded with aggressive cost reduction actions 
sales decreased  million  or  over the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
operating income decreased to million due to the decrease in sales resulting from the decline in end market activity 
the combination of all these factors led to net income of million  a decrease of over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share was in  compared with in our end markets consist of industrial firms  construction and data communication contractors  utility and commercial  institutional and governmental entities 
our sales to these markets can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
we have historically financed our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow  debt issuances  borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our receivables facility 
cash flow we generated million in operating cash flow during included in this amount was net income of million  a decrease in trade and other receivables of million  a decrease in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
investing activities in were primarily comprised of capital expenditures  which totaled million 
financing activities during consisted of borrowings and repayments of million and million  respectively  related to our revolving credit facility  and net repayments of million related to our receivables facility 
financing availability as of december   we had million in total available borrowing capacity 
the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  which has a maturity date of november   was million  of which million was the us sub facility borrowing limit and million was the canadian sub facility borrowing limit 
the available borrowing capacity under the receivables facility  which was amended and restated in april  to among other things extend the maturity dated to april   was million 
in addition  in august  we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the debentures in exchange for approximately million and million in aggregate principal amounts of our debentures and debentures  respectively 
our debentures and debentures cannot be redeemed or repurchased until october and september  respectively 
for further discussion related to the debentures  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we increased our cash by million to million  after taking into account million of net debt repayments and million of capital expenditures 
we monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis  and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions 
for further discussions refer to liquidity and capital resources 
outlook we believe that improvements in operations and capital structure and actions taken in and have positioned us to operate effectively in the lower level of activity being experienced in our end markets 
we expect that the economic recovery will be slow and that market trends in will point towards continued contraction in the non residential construction and utility markets and gradual recovery in the industrial  international and government markets 
in total  we anticipate that the demand in our markets served will drop approximately to from levels and that our growth initiatives will somewhat offset the decrease 
despite competitive pressures  we expect moderate improvements in gross margins due to reduced inventory charges and supplier volume rebate rates recovering to historical norms 
we do not expect the permanent cost reductions made in to be large enough to offset the increase in costs expected in related to the reinstatement of temporary spending cuts and growth initiatives 
while we will not reduce our focus on cost controls in the first quarter of  we anticipate that operating expenses will therefore be higher than fourth quarter levels 
we will remain focused on providing superior customer service  maintaining our cost leadership position  strengthening our team and delivering improved financial results  and we are confident in our ability to operate effectively through this economic downturn 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for product sales when title  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  or for services when the service is rendered 
in the case of stock sales and special orders  a sale occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point  as the terms of our sales are fob shipping point 
in cases where we process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers  revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed 
for some of our customers  we provide services such as inventory management or other specific support 
revenues are recognized upon evidence of fulfillment of the agreed upon services 
in all cases  revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is fixed or is determinable and we have reasonable assurance as to the collectability 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibles made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine unmarketable inventory reflecting historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
supplier volume rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate and accrue the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
we record the amounts as other accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
the corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by us from suppliers 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we test goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using information available at the end of september  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test for impairment on a reporting unit level 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets to the recorded value 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market multiples 
assumptions used for these fair value techniques are based on a combination of historical results  current forecasts  market data and recent economic events 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite life intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment and we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of financial projections 
for our reporting units most sensitive to a further decline in financial performance  primary assumptions included discount rates ranging from to and a terminal growth rate of 
a possible indicator of impairment is the relationship of a company s market capitalization to its book value 
as of december   our market capitalization exceeded our book value 
the persistence or further acceleration of the recent downturn in global economic conditions and turbulence in financial markets could have a further negative impact on our market capitalization and or financial performance 
two reporting units comprised of recent acquisitions  which have goodwill and trademarks totaling million  are sensitive to a further decline in financial performance 
we are taking actions to improve our future financial performance  however  we cannot predict whether or not there will be certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and trademarks  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents intangible assets we account for certain economic benefits purchased as a result of our acquisitions  including customer relations  distribution agreements and trademarks  as intangible assets 
except for trademarks  which have an indefinite life  we amortize intangible assets over a useful life determined by the expected cash flows produced by such intangibles and their respective tax benefits 
useful lives vary between and years  depending on the specific intangible asset 
insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk sharing strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by income tax accounting guidance 
we frequently review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns to determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
convertible debentures we separately account for the liability and equity components of our debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
we estimate our non convertible debt borrowing rate through a combination of discussions with our financial institutions and review of relevant market data 
the discounts to the convertible note balances are amortized to interest expense  using the effective interest method  over the implicit life of the debentures 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are comprised of stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant  and compensation cost is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock options and stock settled appreciation rights is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock 
we estimate the expected life of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 
the forfeiture assumption is based on our historical employee behavior  which we review on an annual basis 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined by the grant date closing price of our common stock 
no dividends are assumed for stock based awards

table of contents contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest  at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
to to after total in millions contractual cash obligations including interest long term debt  excluding debt discount of current and short term debt  excluding debt discount of interest on indebtedness non cancelable operating leases acquisition agreements total contractual cash obligations interest on the variable rate debt was calculated using the rates and balances outstanding at december  purchase orders for inventory requirements and service contracts are not included in the table above 
generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
also  we do not consider obligations to taxing authorities to be contractual obligations requiring disclosure due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these obligations 
as such  we have not included million of such liability in the table above 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  affects different commodities  the cost of products purchased and ultimately the pricing of our different products and product classes to our customers 
we experienced price deflation during  which comprised an estimated million of our sales decline 
overall  price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation deflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
seasonality our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
sales during the first and fourth quarters are generally below the sales of the second and third quarters due to reduced level of activity during the winter months of december  january and february 
sales typically increase beginning in march with slight fluctuations per month through december 
as a result  our reported sales and earnings in the first and fourth quarter are generally lower than in the second and third quarters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe  africa  asia and australia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations  and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have monitored and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk fixed rate borrowings approximately of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt 
at various times  we have refinanced our debt to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
in  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our notes at and million in aggregate principal amount of our debentures at accounted for at an effective fixed rate of 
in  we issued additional fixed rate debt  which included million in aggregate principal amount of our debentures at accounted for at an effective fixed rate of 
in august  we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which we issued million in aggregate principal amount of debentures at accounted for at an effective fixed rate of in exchange for approximately million and million in aggregate principal amounts of our outstanding debentures and debentures  respectively 
as these borrowings were issued at fixed rates  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate fluctuations  although market value would be 
the aggregate fair value of these debt instruments was million at december  interest expense on our other fixed rate debt also would not be impacted by changes in market interest rates  and for this debt  fair value approximated carrying value see note to the consolidated financial statements 
floating rate borrowings our variable rate borrowings at december  of million include million from the receivables facility and million from the revolving credit facility 
the fair value of these debt instruments at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we borrow under our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
during  our average daily borrowing under the facility was million 
borrowings under our facility bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
additionally  we borrow under our receivables facility  which bears interest at the day commercial paper rate plus applicable margin 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings under our current capital structure
