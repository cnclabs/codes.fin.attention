overview gencor industries  inc  the company is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials  synthetic fuels  and environmental control equipment 
the company s core products include asphalt plants  combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems 
the company s products are manufactured in two facilities in the united states 
because the company s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry  the business is seasonal in nature 
traditionally  the company s customers do not purchase new equipment for shipment during the summer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work 
the majority of orders for the company s products are thus received between october and february  with a significant volume of shipments occurring prior to may 
the principal factors driving demand for the company s products are the overall economic conditions  the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and repair  infrastructure development in emerging economies  the need for spare parts  fluctuations in the price of crude oil liquid asphalt as well as fuel costs  and a trend towards larger plants resulting from industry consolidation 
in august  the federal government passed the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu 
this bill appropriated a multi year guaranteed funding of billion for federal highway  transit and safety programs that expired on september  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  which included approximately billion for highway and bridge construction activities 
the arra and any future legislation approved by congress could reduce infrastructure funding levels 
in addition  funding restrictions can be imposed on states that do not comply with certain federal policies 
on march   president obama signed into law the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act 
this law extends authorization of the surface transportation programs previously funded under safetea lu through december  at levels 
in addition  the hire act authorizes a one time transfer of billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund related to previously foregone interest payments 
although the hire act should help stabilize the federal highway program  the company believes a new multi year highway program would have the greatest positive impact on the road construction industry and allow its customers to plan and execute longer term projects 
the company believes that its customers are waiting on the states to move forward with potential projects as their purchasing decisions are significantly influenced by the federal government s legislation on federal road building funding 
the company believes any new funding will have a positive impact on the company s financial performance  although the magnitude of that improvement cannot be determined 

table of contents in january  the canadian government announced its economic action plan to stimulate economic growth which included a billion two year investment in new infrastructure including roads  bridges and other infrastructure 
the company believes that certain programs associated with this funding will have a positive impact on its financial performance although the magnitude of that impact cannot be determined 
economic downturns like the one currently being experienced generally result in reduced purchasing within the company s served markets and thus have a direct impact on sales and tend to increase the pricing pressures on the company s products resulting in lower pricing and margins 
the company s typical sales of asphalt plants are in the to million range and may require the company s customers to obtain some sort of financing 
the current state of the financial industry  the tightening of the credit markets and the higher interest rates  have had an adverse impact on the company s customers attitudes toward purchasing new equipment 
on the positive side  the reduced value of the us dollar has resulted in more interest from international customers 
in addition to government funding and the overall economic conditions  fluctuations in the price of oil  which is a major component of asphalt mix  may affect the company s financial performance 
an increase in the price of oil increases the cost of manufacturing asphalt and could therefore decrease demand for asphalt and certain of the company s products 
the company does not currently foresee the fluctuations in oil prices having a significant impact on its financial performance 
steel is a major component used in manufacturing the company s equipment 
steel prices were at historically high levels during and the company increased sales prices during to offset the rising steel costs 
during the fourth quarter of  steel prices retreated sharply from their highs and continued the downward trend through the first half of with subsequent moderate increases during the remainder of and first half of in the current economy and competitive environment  the company does not expect to be able to raise prices to cover the increasing costs of steel and its financial results could be negatively affected 
for the long term  the company believes the strategy of continuing to invest heavily in product engineering and development and its focus on delivering a high quality product and superior service will strengthen the company s market position when demand for capital equipment rebounds 
in response to the short term outlook  the company has taken aggressive actions to conserve cash  right size its operations and cost structure  and will continue to do so based on its forecasts 
these actions included adjustments to workforce and staffing  reduced purchases of raw materials and reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company continues to review its internal processes to identify efficiencies and cost reductions and will continue scrutinizing its relationships with external suppliers to ensure the company is achieving the highest quality products and services at the most competitive cost
