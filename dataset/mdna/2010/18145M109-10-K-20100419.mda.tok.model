summary of business the company is a niche provider of non asset based transportation management and logistics services to the print media industry throughout the united states and between the united states and other countries 
the company operates through a network of distribution centers where it consolidates mass market consumer publications so that the publications can be transported in larger  more efficient quantities to common destination points 
the company generates revenues by arranging for the movement of its customers freight in trailers and containers

as part of its bundled service offering  the company tracks shipments in transit and handles claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of its customers 
because the company owns relatively little transportation equipment  it relies on independent transportation carriers 
on a day to day basis  customers communicate their freight needs  typically on a shipment by shipment basis  to one of the company s transportation offices distribution centers for dissemination to its operating companies for upload into the respective computer systems each company utilizes to meet the specific requirements of its customer base 
the company s employees enter information about each shipment into its proprietary computer system 
with the help of the computer system  the company s employees then determine the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and select a carrier or carriers  based upon their knowledge of the carrier s service capability  equipment availability  freight rates and other relevant factors

recent events credit facility with cole taylor bank on march   the company entered into the credit agreement with cole taylor bank 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to  with a  sublimit for letters of credit 
the credit agreement is more fully described under item in the section entitled recent events credit facility with cole taylor bank 
settlement of escrow claim on december   the company settled all of its claims for indemnification under the spa  as more fully disclosed under item pursuant to the settlement agreement  among other things  approximately  of the funds held in the indemnification escrow were released to the company and the remainder was released to the sellers 
the settlement agreement is more fully described under item instability in the newsstand distribution channel in the first quarter of  there was a disruption of the wholesaler distribution supply channel  that caused a significant disruption of services for approximately a four week period 
initially  two of the four wholesalers demanded distribution surcharges from the publishers and national distributors to cover their operating losses and threatened a suspension of service if these price demands were not met 
this resulted in two of the four wholesalers ceasing distribution operations temporarily on february  one of the wholesalers that had ceased delivery of product reached a settlement with the national distributors and publishers concerning pricing and distribution 
the other wholesaler ceased operations in early february  liquidated its holdings and filed a lawsuit in us district court southern district of new york against publishers  national distributors and other wholesalers  alleging the defendants conspired to purge  and through coordinated action have purged  plaintiff from the magazine distribution industry and have destroyed plaintiff s business 
all of the defendants are existing customers of ours and a settlement against them could affect our business 
impact of current economic recession the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession  downturns in business cycles of our customers  fuel shortages  price increases by carriers  interest rate fluctuations  and other economic factors beyond our control 
many of the company s customers business models are dependent on expenditures by advertisers 
these expenditures tend to be cyclical  reflecting general economic conditions  as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
if the current economic recession or a downturn in its customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers  particularly to the single copy distribution channel  the company s operating results could also be adversely affected 
accounting for the acquisition and related transactions on february   the company consummated the acquisition  as more fully described under item in the section entitled the acquisition 
at the closing of the acquisition  the company purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of cgi for a total consideration of  of which  was paid in cash and  by the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share  the average share price at the announcement of the spa plus an adjustment of  based on cgi s estimated working capital at the closing 
subsequently  an additional adjustment of  was paid to the stockholders of cgi based on cgi s working capital at the closing as finally determined 
in connection with the closing of the acquisition  the company changed its name from global logistics acquisition corporation to clark holdings inc holders of  of the company s shares of common stock voted against the acquisition and  elected successfully to convert their shares into a pro rata portion of the trust account approximately per share or an aggregate amount of 
after giving effect to i the issuance of  shares in connection with the acquisition and ii the conversion of shares  there were  shares of common stock outstanding after the acquisition 
in addition  the founders of the company placed  shares of common stock into escrow pending the attainment of a specified market price restricted shares 
as a result of the condition to which the escrowed shares will be subject  such shares will be considered as contingently issuable shares and  as a result  are not included in the earnings per share calculations 
accordingly  the company will recognize a charge based on the fair value of the shares over the expected period of time it will take to achieve the target price  if and only if the expected probability of the share price attaining the specified market price exceeds percent 
at the closing of the acquisition  we entered into the escrow agreement  providing for the indemnification escrow  the working capital escrow and the discontinued operations escrow  as more fully described under item in the section entitled the acquisition 
on august   one third of the indemnification escrow  or million  was released to former stockholders of cgi in accordance with the terms of the spa and the escrow agreement 
on september   the entire discontinued operations escrow was released to the former stockholders of cgi 
by the end of the third quarter of  the entire working capital escrow had been released  all of which was due to the company in accordance with the spa and the escrow agreement  but  of which was paid to the sellers in satisfaction of the aforementioned adjustment to the acquisition consideration based on the working capital at closing as finally determined 
on december   the remainder of the indemnification escrow was released  approximately  of which was paid to the company in settlement of all of its claims for indemnification  as more fully described under item  and the remainder of which was paid to the former stockholders of cgi 
the company has accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values  including identifiable intangibles and remaining cost allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price for the acquisition at closing was determined based on the value of the cash consideration paid by the company  the average value of company s common stock on or about the spa arrangement date  and the direct acquisition costs incurred 
the aggregate purchase price of  represents the sum of i  which represents cash consideration paid directly to cgi s shareholders  ii  deposited in three separate escrows  as described above iii  of deferred acquisition costs paid at closing  iv  of deferred acquisition costs paid prior to closing  and v  for  shares of common stock that were issued to two executive officers of cgi at closing 
components of the purchase price distribution are as follows cash to cgi shareholders cash in escrow acquisition costs paid at closing acquisition costs paid prior to closing total issuance of  shares of common stock at per share total purchase price reconciliation of initial cash payment per the spa to cash paid at closing of the acquisition is summarized as follows initial estimate of cash distribution cash in escrow interim working capital adjustment to purchase price reimbursement of professional fees cash to cgi shareholders a preliminary allocation of the purchase price of cgi to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of cgi on february   was made and recorded during the weeks ended march   and subsequently amended 
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price  including the evaluation and allocation to identifiable intangible assets  recognition of deferred taxes and allocation to goodwill resulting from the acquisition  was made by management 
during the first three quarters of  additional adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation were recorded to goodwill 
in the fourth quarter  it became apparent to management after a detailed review of the information systems  that the intangible with an original estimated value of million identified as software as of the purchase date  was deemed to have no fair value 
this resulted in a purchase price adjustment which reclassified million of the original fair value of the software to goodwill 
in addition  management also adjusted the purchase price allocation after completing a review of the assumptions associated with the non compete intangible  in which a technical error was discovered in the original valuation 
as a result  the non compete intangible s value was considered to be overstated by million and understated goodwill by the like amount 
this adjustment was also recorded in the fourth quarter 
these adjustments resulted in a reclassification of million from identifiable intangibles to goodwill and the deferred tax liability associated with the intangibles along with goodwill were both reduced by million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company  according to fasb topic asc  performed its annual goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment tests  and determined that all the goodwill and a portion of the remaining intangible assets had been impaired 
consequently  the company recorded a non cash charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets impairment during the fourth quarter of  as discussed in this item under the section entitled impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
the final allocation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of cgi are as follows preliminary allocation at adjustments to preliminary purchase price allocation deferred tax liability adjustment associated with final purchase price adjustments final purchase price allocation current assets current assets of discontinued operations property and equipment intangibles goodwill current liabilities current liabilities of discontinued operations deferred tax liability total fair value of assets and liabilities impairment to goodwill and other intangibles goodwill impairment for the company  during the fourth quarter of  in accordance with fasb topic asc  performed its annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life 
the company concluded that its market capitalization had been below its net book value for an extended period of time 
management therefore assessed the fair value of its reporting units using both an income approach with a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using the observed market capitalization based on the quoted price of our common stock 
management compared these values to each reporting units carrying amount  including goodwill and identified an impairment 
the evaluation resulted in a million impairment charge which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ending january   are as follows goodwill associated with the acquisition of the clark group inc balance at february  adjustments to goodwill impairment charge balance at january  intangible asset impairment for during  chi formerly known as global logistics acquisition corporation acquired cgi resulting in acquisition related intangible assets 
acquisition related intangible assets at january   and february   as amended  consisted of the following january  amortization period balance amortization expense impairment balance non compete agreements trade names customer relationships as part of the acquisition  the company gained the rights to the clark group tradename 
the income approach indicates value based on the present worth of future economic benefits 
this approach explicitly recognizes that the current value of an investment is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits such as cash flows or cost savings 
a variant of the income approach  known as the relief from royalty approach  is used in the valuation of assets involving fair royalty rates eg  trademarks  patents  eg this valuation methodology is premised on the following hypothetical construct if the owners operators of a company wanted to continue to use tradename in the conduct of their business  but found they did not actually have the legal right to do so  they would be compelled to pay the rightful owner a fair and reasonable royalty for that right  since ownership of a tradename relieves the company from making such payments  the financial performance of the firm is enhanced to the extent of the royalty payments avoided  and capitalization of the after tax effect of the royalty relief at an appropriate rate yields the value of the tradename 
the company utilized the relief from royalty method in determining the fair value of the clark group tradename 
the reason for using this method is that management deemed it impractical to determine the fair value of the tradename based upon a market approach 
the relief from royalty income approach estimates the portion of a company s earnings attributable to a tradename based upon the royalty rate the company would have paid for the use of the tradename if it did not own it 
therefore  a portion of the earnings  equal to the after tax royalty that might have been paid for the use of the tradename  can be attributed to its ownership and therefore  the relief from royalty method  was deemed the most appropriate valuation method 
intangibles assets with an indefinite life ie  trade names  were evaluated for impairment at january  by management using the relief from royalty method 
this evaluation  based on this acceptable method of valuation  resulted in a million impairment charge which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that our market capitalization was below our net book value for an extended period of time  and as a result  our long lived assets were tested for recoverability 
due to the impact of the weakening global economy  our revenue projections related to the intangible assets acquired have declined 
the trade name intangible  due to its indefinite life  was evaluated using fasb topic asc along with the goodwill 
this evaluation resulted in a million impairment charge which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge taken was calculated as the difference between the book value of the tradename and the calculated fair value by use of the relief from royalty method as discussed above 
significant assumptions included in management s analysis were the determination of a royalty rate  projections of future revenues and a discount rate 
profitability was deemed to be a significant determinant for a royalty rate in that a company or an investor would not be willing to pay a rate in excess of a reasonable percentage of the operating income generated by the tradename 
there was little change in management s expectation for the tradename from the date of acquisition through january   therefore  the royalty rate of that was used in the initial determination of the fair value of the tradename was used in impairment analysis as of january  in calculating the royalty rate of  management estimated that royalty savings would equate to  per year 
in estimating this amount  management considered a variety of factors including but not limited to the magnitude of the projected tradenames net sales and the asset s perceived marketing strength and recognition among customers and competitors 
royalty savings of  per year corresponds to a royalty rate of of annual revenues based on total revenues 
the future revenues for the tradename valuation were based on sales growth rate forecasts of the company as of january  the sales growth rate forecasts as of january  were substantially lower than they were as of february  when the clark group  inc was acquired and the initial valuation performed as a result of the weakening global economy 
the pretax royalty savings due to the tradename was then calculated by the application of the estimated royalty rate to the projected net sales 
a income tax rate was utilized to convert the estimated pretax royalty savings to appropriate after tax amounts 
the future annual cash flows attributable to the tradenames were then discounted to present value at a new  higher risk adjusted interest rate as of january  the reason for a higher risk adjusted interest rate was due to the higher cost of capital incurred by the company as of this time 
intangibles assets with an indefinite life ie  trade names  were evaluated for impairment at january   by management in accordance with fasb topic asc  using the relief from royalty method 
this evaluation resulted in a million impairment charge which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
total impairment for the impairment in the statement of operations for the year ending january   was calculated as follows impairment amount goodwill trade names total intangible asset impairment for acquisition related identifiable intangible assets at january  and january   as adjusted  consisted of the following january  amortization period balance amortization expense impairment balance trade names non compete agreements customer relationships intangibles assets with an indefinite life ie  trade names  were evaluated for impairment at january   by management in accordance with fasb topic asc  using the relief from royalty method 
this evaluation resulted in a  impairment charge for the weeks ended january   which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the calculation of the january  impairment charge of million associated with the trade names intangibles  management used the same valuation method  ie  the relief from royalty 
this methodology is described in more detail above and on the previous page 
the projections prepared by management reflected the continued economic recession and the valuation method also included a higher discount rate to reflect the both the economic recession and the company s operating losses for the weeks ended january  as in any valuation model  there are risks inherent in the assumptions utilized and the achievability of these assumptions is not certain 
due to the continuing adverse economic impact on the company s market capitalization along with the operating losses incurred during  management evaluated intangibles and fixed assets with definite lives for impairment as of january   in accordance with fasb topic asc management s projections of undiscounted future cash flows did not exceed the carrying amount of the non complete agreements intangible asset 
as a result of this undiscounted future cash flow test step test  the net book value of the non compete agreements were lower than the undiscounted cash flow  the company calculated the fair value of these non compete agreements  which resulted in  impairment charge 
this impairment charge was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of these non compete agreements was calculated by determining the expected value of the cash flows that would be lost due to competition from the executives and or prior owners if the non compete agreement did not exist 
the value of the non compete agreement is measured as the difference between the projected cash flows of the company if the executive prior owners were free to compete considering the probability of choosing to compete in a given year versus being prohibited from competing 
the probability considers the desire to compete and the likelihood to competing effectively and taking business away from the acquired company 
once the expected value of the future cash flows were projected  the company used a higher discount rate than used in the previous year 
this higher discount was used due to the continuing economic crisis and the company s operating losses during the weeks ended january  included in any valuation model there are risks inherent in the assumptions utilized and achievability of these assumptions is not certain 
for the customer relationships intangibles and fixed assets evaluation for the weeks ended january   management s projections of undiscounted future cash flows did exceed the carrying amount of the customer relationship s intangible asset and fixed assets  which resulted in no charge for impairment 
the impairment in the statement of operations for the year ended january  is as follows impairment january  trade names non compete agreements total related party transactions the company provided logistics and transportation services for anderson merchandisers  lp  related through common ownership 
the revenue related to these services was  for the weeks ended january    for the weeks ended january   and  for the weeks ended february   and is included in gross revenues 
accounts receivable included in the consolidated balance sheet from anderson merchandisers  lp  were and  as of january  and january   respectively 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes and schedules thereto

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
gross profit is a non gaap financial measure that is equal to gross revenue less freight expense 
the company uses this financial measure to evaluate its historical performance  as well as its performance relative to its competitors 
specifically  management uses this financial measure to further its own understanding of the company s core operating performance  ie  the transportation of goods 
the most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is loss income from operations 
the following table reconciles gross profit to loss income from operations for the reporting period  the reporting period and the predecessor period is as follows in thousands clark holdings inc cgi successor predecessor for weeks ended for weeks ended for weeks ended january  january  january  loss income from operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and intangible assets selling  operating and administrative expenses gross profit results of operations weeks ended january   weeks ended january  and weeks ended february  revenues

successor successor predecessor weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended january  january  february  gross revenue freight expense gross profit depreciation and amortization selling  operating administrative expenses income from operations domestic revenue declined to million during the reporting period as compared to the reporting period 
the revenue decline was mitigated by the week differential that exists between the and reporting periods  with the predecessor period generating million in gross revenue 
the decrease in gross revenue was the result of a decline in pool distribution tonnage driven by weak economic conditions and a reduction in advertising pages in as compared to the sharp drop in oil prices during reporting period compared to reporting period also resulted in a decrease in energy surcharge invoicing 
the decrease in international gross revenues of during the reporting period as compared to the reporting period was attributable to tonnage decreasing by approximately in same store sales during the reporting period as compared to the reporting period  with the revenue decline being mitigated by the week differential that exists between the reporting periods 
gross revenue was million for the week predecessor period 
an increase in airfreight offset a portion of the decline in ocean tonnage during the reporting period 
new non print media customers were added representing of total gross revenue with new customer relationships in europe  including the uk and asia  including china  singapore  and the philippines 
the tonnage reductions were the result of a decline in advertising pages for certain customers publications mostly moving via ocean service to the uk and europe

as with gross revenue  the decline in gross profit dollars generated was mitigated by the week differential that exists between the and reporting periods 
gross profit for the week predecessor period was million 
the improved gross margin profit percentage from in the reporting period to in the reporting period was the combined result of numerous initiatives to reduce transportation cost 
these initiatives include the use of intermodal transportation and increasing our pool of carriers as we looked to achieve lower rates per lane 
the company s use of intermodal transportation in increased over prior year  with rail transportation representing approximately of all the miles traveled in distributing the domestic pool tonnage in intermodal transportation is generally less expensive than road transportation by as much as in the transportation lanes where it is used 
international gross profit decreased by during the reporting period in comparison to the reporting period  with the gross profit decline being mitigated by the week differential that exists between the and reporting periods 
this decrease is the result of the decline in tonnage and the change in the mix of international s services  which also resulted in an improvement in gross margin percentage to of gross revenue in the reporting period

the company continues to implement its strategy of growing the international division and deploying more efficient processes 
liquidity  capital resources and the impact of the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles our primary cash requirements are for working capital  borrowing obligations and capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and our amended bank credit facility are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including working capital  capital expenditure requirements  taxes and the term loan amortization obligations 
simultaneously with the acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement with boa at the time known as lasalle bank national association  which was subsequently amended on april   september  and february  the credit agreement with boa  as amended  provided for a term loan of million and revolving loans and letters of credit of up to million 
as of january   the outstanding balance of the term loan was million  the outstanding balance of the revolving loans was and the outstanding balance of the letters of credit was million 
on march   the company entered into the credit agreement with cole taylor bank  using a portion of the proceeds from its initial loan under the new facility  in combination with available cash  to repay its then existing loans from boa 
under the new facility  the company received a financing commitment of up to million 
interest on the new facility is payable at basis points over the prime rate or basis points over libor 
the new facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit agreement and the new facility are more fully described under item in the section entitled recent events credit facility with cole taylor bank 
the amortization of the identifiable intangibles is a million charge per year for financial statement purposes 
this amortization is not deductible for tax purposes 
consequently  our future outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed our income tax expense by approximately million per year assuming a effective tax rate 
however  the company has sufficient ability to carry back million of income against prior year taxes  which will reduce the current year s taxes paid 
in october  the company signed a software and equipment agreement with an ibm services partner to implement a new accounting and operational software erp package 
simultaneously  the company is also updating and making selective improvements to its infrastructure to support compliance with regulatory requirements and to accommodate the new application suite 
these projects will be funded through a combination of internally generated cash flow  operating and or capital leases

the company has no material revenues relating to activities where these factors are not present

domestic ground freight estimates are highly predictable and are based on historical delivery data 
gross revenue and freight costs for international air and ocean freight forwarding services are recognized based upon the estimated arrival date of the shipments 
international air and ocean freight transit estimates are based on published third party carrier arrival schedules 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company considers all short term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than days to be cash equivalents 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at management s estimate of net realizable value

fair value of financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist of accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value 
operating leases the company leases most of its distribution facilities and transportation equipment 
at inception  each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
the company currently has no leases that meet the capital lease requirements  therefore all leases are currently accounted for as operating 
the company records rental expense on a straight line basis 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made  historical experience  risk of loss  general economic conditions and trends  and the assessment of the probable future outcome 
some of the more significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets  purchase price allocations of acquired businesses  valuation of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets  assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation  incurred but not report claims and estimates of delivery time 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of changes  if any  are reflected in the statement of operations in the period that they are determined 
the company accrues freight expense for any transportation costs that have been incurred  but have not been included in accounts payable 
these estimates are used to substantiate vendor invoices for purchased transportation for shipments that have been completed at the end of the period 
at any time we have about weeks of freight expense accrued domestically and about weeks accrued for international operations 
clark maintains a relational database of all freight purchases by vendor and by lane to assist in the purchase of freight and the estimation of the accruals at period end 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance to provide for the liabilities for workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  and vehicle liability 
liabilities associated with the self insured risks are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities  portions of which are calculated by independent third party service providers  could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
the self insurance reserve for medical  dental and workers compensation was included in accrued expense on the balance sheets at january   and january   and was  and  respectively

acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired using the purchase method 
under fasb topic asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test for intangible assets consists of a comparison of its fair value with its carrying value  if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair market value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair market value is equal to or greater than the unit s carrying value  then goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
alternatively  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair market value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter 
other intangible assets  which include non compete agreements and customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years 
comprehensive income fasb topic asc  comprehensive income  established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income for the weeks ended january   weeks ended january   and the weeks ended february  were the same as net income for the company 
stock based compensation fasb topic asc  compensation stock compensation requires the company to recognize expense for its share based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
option valuation methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
measured compensation expense related to such option grants  is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related grants 
note prior to the acquisition there was no stock based compensation

gains and losses on translation were not material 
income taxes the company early adopted the provisions of fasb topic asc  income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements and requires companies to use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
for the weeks ended january  and the weeks ended january   the company had no material unrecognized income tax benefits  expected changes to unrecognized income tax benefits or interest and penalties 
the company s accounting policy for recognition of interest and penalties related to income taxes is to include such items as a component of income tax expense 
cgi was a subchapter s corporation through february   the date of acquisition 
prior to february   cgi was not subject to federal or state income tax  with the exception of certain states that do not recognize federal s corporation status 
cgi had evaluated the potential tax  interest and penalties relating to this exposure as of december   it was determined to be immaterial 
upon acquisition  cgi s s corporation status was terminated  and after that date  the company will be taxed as a c corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
the company will file a consolidated income tax return for federal tax purposes and in states where consolidated filings are allowed or required 
the company will file income tax returns in the united kingdom for its discontinued foreign subsidiary for the company will begin filing in all jurisdictions determined by the company to have potential exposure in in addition  the company  as a result of a nexus study  had determined that an increase in the number of states the company currently files in will be implemented

fasb topic asc  income taxes management has developed control processes and procedures that will achieve the following control objectives with respect to fasb topic asc and uncertain tax positions all material tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns are identified 
the appropriate unit of account is determined for each material tax position 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized 
all tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized 
all previously unrecognized tax positions that subsequently meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the first interim period in which the recognition threshold is met 
all previously recognized tax positions that subsequently fail to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first interim period in which the recognition threshold is no longer met 
the amount of benefit recognized for each tax position is the largest amount that is greater than percent likely to be realized 
new information such as new tax laws  regulations  and court cases that affects the recognition and measurement of the benefits of a tax position is identified in a timely manner and properly evaluated 
the recognition and measurement of the benefits of a tax position reflect all information available to management at the reporting date and do not take into account facts and circumstances and developments occurring after the reporting date but before the issuance of the financial statements 
interest and penalties are properly measured and recorded for all uncertain tax positions 
amounts recorded for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  are properly presented  classified  and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
earnings per common share eps prior to the acquisition  the company was privately held and did not calculate earnings per share 
the company measures the effects of options and warrants on diluted eps through application of the treasury stock method  whereby the proceeds received by the company based on assumed exercise are hypothetically used to repurchase the company s common stock at the average market price for the period 
dilution will occur according to the treasury stock method only if the average market price of the company s common stock is higher than the exercise price of either the stock options and or warrants 
when the opposite is present ie  the average market price is lower  the results are antidilutive  and the impact of either the stock options and or warrants is ignored 
the average market price of the company s common stock from january   to january   was 
and since it was lower than the exercise price of the warrants  the impact of the warrants is excluded from the diluted eps calculation for the week period ended january the average market price of the company s common stock from january   to january   was and since it was lower than the exercise price of the warrants  the impact of the warrants is excluded from the diluted eps calculation for the week period ended january during the weeks ended january   the average market price of the company s stock was not higher than the exercise price of certain options granted  therefore  the impact of certain stock options is excluded in the diluted eps calculations for the weeks ended january during the weeks ended january   the average market price of the company s stock was not higher than the exercise price of certain options granted  therefore  the impact of certain stock options is excluded in the diluted eps calculations for the weeks ended january new accounting standards fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements
