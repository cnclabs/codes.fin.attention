comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental income 
rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is primarily due to rental revenues of million earned during the year ended december  on twelve properties acquired by us during the increase in rental income was offset by a decrease in rent payments from two tenants adversely affected by the recession and by a lease termination in june  for which we received the lease termination fee referred to below 
lease termination fee 
the lease termination fee income received in resulted from a  lease termination payment from a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis  but had vacated the property in march  offset by the write off of the entire balance of the unbilled rent receivable and intangible lease asset related to this property  aggregating  there was no comparable fee income in this property was released effective november  operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization increases of  on twelve properties acquired during  as well as from an increase in depreciation expense of building improvements 
real estate expenses 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from real estate taxes and utilities related to our vacant property 
in addition  the year ended december  includes real estate taxes for another property which became subject to a lease with a new tenant under which we are responsible for the real estate taxes  and an increase in repairs  maintenance and other operating expenses at several properties 
other income and expenses gain on dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in the year ended december   we recognized a net gain of  on the sale by a joint venture of a vacant property 
there was no comparable gain in the year ended december  interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily because we had less cash available for investment as we applied available cash to purchase nine properties in september in addition  interest rates earned on short term cash equivalents declined significantly 
offsetting the decrease in interest income was  of consulting fee income and  received for granting an easement at one of our properties  both recorded in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the payoff in full of two mortgage loans during the year  as well as from the monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
these decreases were offset by interest expense on fixed rate mortgages placed on three properties between september and march in addition  at the end of september  we borrowed million under our line of credit which was applied to the purchase of eight properties  of which million was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties 
accordingly  interest expense relating to our line of credit increased by  during the year ended december  amortization of deferred financing costs 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase results primarily from accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of  relating to a mortgage loan that was refinanced during and from  relating to a mortgage loan that was repaid in full during income from settlement with former president 
in november  civil litigations commenced by us as plaintiff  against our former president and chief executive officer  arising out of his inappropriate financial dealings  were settled  and we received  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at  based on the november  closing price 
we were also assigned an interest in a real estate consulting venture  the value of which was fully reserved against 
gain on sale of excess unimproved land 
during the year ended december   we sold five acres of excess unimproved land that we acquired as part of the purchase of a flex building in and recognized a gain of million 
there was no such gain in the year ended december  discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december  and includes the operations of eight of our properties  five of which were conveyed to the mortgagee and three of which were sold during the year ended december  in july  non recourse mortgages  secured and cross collateralized by five of our properties that had formerly been leased to circuit city stores inc  had an outstanding balance of  circuit city stores  inc filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws in november and rejected leases for two of our properties in december and rejected leases for the remaining three properties in march no payments were made on these mortgages from december  and a letter of default was received on march  in july  these properties were conveyed to the mortgagee by deeds in lieu of foreclosure and we and our five wholly owned subsidiaries which owned the circuit city properties were released from all obligations  including principal  interest and real estate taxes due 
we had accrued mortgage interest expense totaling  for the period december through july  and accrued real estate tax expense totaling  on these five properties 
the carrying value of the portfolio of the properties transferred of  net of the  of impairment charges taken at december   approximated their fair value at the time of transfer 
during the year ended december   we recognized an  gain based on the excess of the carrying amount of the payables mortgage  real estate taxes and mortgage interest over the fair value of the portfolio of properties transferred 
the gain also reflects the write off of deferred costs and escrows relating to these mortgages totaling  in addition to the  impairment charge taken during the year ended december  against the circuit city properties discussed above  an impairment charge of  was taken against another property in  where a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis had vacated the property in in march  we sold this property and recorded an impairment charge of  to recognize the loss 
in october  in unrelated transactions  we sold two properties and recognized gains for accounting purposes totaling  there were no comparable gains in the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues 
rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues of million earned during the year ended december  on twelve properties acquired by us during the increase in rental income as compared to also resulted from a  write off of the intangible lease liability related to a property where we directly assumed in december the sublease for a property leased by us to circuit city and subleased by circuit city to a furniture retailer 
additionally  in and  we wrote off the entire balance of unbilled rent receivable relating to several properties 
operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of  on twelve properties acquired between january and september general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a number of factors  including a a  decrease paid under the compensation and services agreement  b a  decrease in federal excise tax expense  and c a  decrease in state tax expense 
these decreases were offset by several factors  including i a  increase in payroll and payroll related expenses for full time employees  and ii a  increase in professional fees incurred in connection with civil litigations commenced by us as plaintiff  arising out of the activities of our former president and chief executive officer 
real estate expenses 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from real estate taxes for three of our properties  including one vacant property and a property which became subject to a lease with a new tenant under which we are responsible for the real estate taxes 
other income and expenses gain on dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in the years ended december  and  two of our joint ventures each sold a vacant property and we recognized gains on sale of  and  respectively 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased by million  or  to  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  due to the credit crisis  interest rates steadily declined over the past several quarters resulting in a decrease in the income we earn on our investment in short term cash equivalents 
in addition  we had less cash available for investment after we paid a special distribution of million to our stockholders in october and purchased nine properties in september also contributing to the decrease in interest and other income was the inclusion of a  gain on the sale of available for sale securities in the year ended december  we did not have a similar sale of securities in interest expense 
interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  at the end of september  we borrowed million under our credit facility which was applied to the purchase of eight office depot properties  of which million was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties 
accordingly  interest expense relating to our credit facility increased by  during the year ended december  the increase was also due to interest expense on fixed rate mortgages placed on three properties between august and september  and the assumption of two fixed rate mortgages in connection with the purchase of two properties in january and february these increases were offset from the payoff in full of two mortgage loans  as well as from the monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
gain on sale of excess unimproved land 
during the year ended december   we sold five acres of excess land that we acquired as part of the purchase of a flex building in and recognized a gain of million 
there was no such gain in the year ended december  discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased by million  or  to a loss of million for the year ended december  from income of million for the year ended december  and includes the operations of eight of our properties  five of which were conveyed to the mortgagee circuit city properties during the year ended december  and three of which were sold during the year ended december  the decrease in discontinued operations results substantially from million of impairment charges we recorded during the year ended december  relating to four of these properties 
an impairment charge of million was recorded relating to three of our circuit city properties and  was related to a retail furniture property 
circuit city rejected leases for two of the properties in december and rejected the lease for the third property in march our analysis determined that the other two properties leased to circuit city which were rejected in march  did not require an impairment charge 
although the retail furniture property has been vacant  the tenant is current in its rent payments 
there was no impairment charge recorded in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our capital sources include income from our operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities  borrowings under a revolving credit facility  refinancing existing mortgage loans and obtaining mortgage loans secured by our unencumbered properties 
our available liquidity at december  was approximately million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of marketable securities 
our available liquidity as of march  giving effect to the acquisition by us of a community shopping center on february  was approximately million  including cash and available for sale securities 
liquidity and financing we expect to meet all of our capital needs with cash flow generated by our operating activities  primarily  rental income 
to the extent that cash provided by our operations is not adequate to cover all of our capital needs which we do not anticipate  we will be required to use our available cash and cash equivalents and or sell our marketable securities to pay our capital needs 
mortgage loans aggregating million in principal amount mature in  of which a million mortgage loan was repaid in january  a million mortgage loan matured on march  and a million mortgage loan is due on april  additionally  one mortgage loan  with an outstanding principal amount of million  has been since october  callable on ninety days notice by the mortgagee 
we are seeking to refinance or extend the mortgage loans which have or will become due in as well as the mortgage loan due upon demand  and we intend to repay the amount not refinanced or extended from our existing cash position  including our marketable securities 
in addition  at december   we owned unencumbered income producing real estate with an aggregate carrying value  before accumulated depreciation  of million  which we may seek to finance if we determine we need additional liquidity 
we continually seek to refinance existing mortgage loans on terms we deem acceptable  in order to generate additional liquidity 
additionally  in the normal course of our business  we sell properties when we determine that it is in our best interests which also generates additional liquidity 
further  since each of our encumbered properties is subject to a non recourse mortgage with standard carve outs  if our in house evaluation of the market value of such property is substantially less than the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage loan  we may determine to convey such property to the mortgagee in order to terminate our mortgage obligations  including payment of interest  principal and real estate taxes  with respect to such property 
our credit facility expires on march  currently  there is million outstanding under our credit facility 
we have negotiated a modification and extension of our credit facility with our lending syndicate and have reached an understanding on all material terms  including among other items  a two year extension 
for a discussion of all of the material terms of the proposed modification and extension of the credit facility  see credit facility below 
we are confident the modification and extension of the credit facility will be consummated  and that our lending syndicate will continue our current credit facility until the modification and extension is consummated 
in the event that we do not consummate the modification and extension  our lending syndicate may demand prompt re payment of the million outstanding under the credit facility 
if that occurs and we are unable to fully repay the million outstanding as we have been unable to i obtain a new credit facility  ii secure adequate funds by refinancing existing mortgages and or mortgaging unencumbered properties  or iii unable to raise funds by other means whether by equity or debt offerings or securing short term financing  etc  we will be required to sell certain of our properties at prices we may deem inadequate in order to secure funds to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
typically  we utilize funds from a credit facility to acquire a property and  thereafter secure long term  fixed rate mortgage debt on such property 
we apply the proceeds from the mortgage loan to repay borrowings under the credit facility  thus providing us with the ability to re borrow under the credit facility for the acquisition of additional properties 
as a result  in order to grow our business  it is important to have a credit facility in place in order for us to pursue an active acquisition program 
if we are unable to consummate the modification and extension of our credit facility or obtain a new credit facility  then unless we can raise additional equity or long term debt  of which there is no assurance  we will be significantly constrained in our ability to acquire properties 
in addition  in the current credit environment  borrowers are limited in their ability to obtain mortgage financing 
if we continue to be limited in obtaining mortgage financing either for acquisitions or with respect to our properties  it will also adversely affect our ability to acquire additional properties 
accordingly  our long term liquidity is dependent i upon our ability to document the modification and extension of our credit facility or obtain a new credit facility  ii the increased availability of long term  institutional mortgage financing  or iii our ability to raise additional equity or long term debt 
credit facility we are a party to a credit agreement  as amended  with vnb new york corp  bank leumi  usa  manufacturers and traders trust company and israel discount bank of new york  which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to pay off existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus or the bank s prime rate and there is an unused facility fee of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
as of december  and march   there was million outstanding under the facility 
we have negotiated a modification and extension of our credit facility with our lending syndicate and have agreed on all of the material terms 
the proposed modification and extension will reduce the availability under the facility from million to million  extend the expiration date from march  to march   increase the interest rate from the lower of libor plus or the banks prime rate to day libor plus  with a minimum interest rate of per annum 
until we have executed the modification and extension  our lending syndicate has advised us that our current credit facility will remain in place  but we will not be permitted to draw down any additional funds under our credit facility 
although  we are confident that the modification and extension will be documented substantially in accordance with the agreed upon terms  there can be no assurance that it will be consummated 
in the event  that the modification and extension is not consummated  we expect to have sufficient liquidity available to us to fully repay the million outstanding under our credit facility 
as a result  we will be required to seek liquidity from other sources  including refinancing mortgages  financing unencumbered properties  selling assets  raising equity or obtaining short or long term debt 
contractual obligations the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated 
it also includes the amount due at maturity under our credit facility and does not include the million mortgage we assumed in connection with the purchase of a community shopping center we acquired on february  amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages payable interest and amortization mortgages payable balances due at maturity credit facility total as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in mortgage indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million  including million due under our credit facility  due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity  obtain long or short term debt  or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated to pay rent under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows amounts in thousands total more than years we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders pursuant to internal revenue procedures 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
in  our board determined that  in view of the economic environment  we should conserve our capital 
as a result  all of our dividends declared in consisted of stock and cash  pursuant to revenue procedures issued by the internal revenue service 
on march   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share payable in cash on april  to record holders on march  our board of directors reviews the dividend policy at each regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting to determine if any changes to our dividend should be made and whether the distribution should consist of all cash or a combination of cash and stock 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  provided in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these critical accounting policies include the following  discussed below 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
we assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
it is our policy not to record straight line rent beyond the expected useful life of a building 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history and the financial condition of the tenant 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we are required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which has an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken  and will decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment to the value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the current financial statements or other available financial information of the tenant  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  if the undiscounted cash flow analysis yields an amount which is less than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
the estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge  but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
at december   we had one interest rate swap agreement outstanding that was entered into march the fair market value of the interest rate swap is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there had been a increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swap and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have increased by approximately  if there were a decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swap and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have decreased by approximately  these changes would not have any impact on our net income or cash 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with our mortgage debt excluding our mortgage subject to the interest swap agreement  it bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit facility is a revolving variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
we assessed the market risk for our revolving variable rate credit facility and believe that a increase in interest rates would cause a decrease in net income and cash of  and a decrease would cause an increase in net income and cash of  based on the million outstanding on our credit facility at december  the fair market value of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value at december  excluding a community shopping center we acquired on february  for the year ended december amounts in thousands there after total fair market value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt note note our credit line facility matures on march  and bears interest at the lower of libor plus or the respective bank s prime rate
