year ended december  in thousands other non gaap financial data ebitda ebitdar ebitda and ebitdar are supplemental non gaap financial measures 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we calculate ebitda as net income before a interest expense  net  b provision for income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
we calculate ebitdar by adjusting ebitda to exclude facility rent cost of services 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
we believe ebitda and ebitdar are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense  net and depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
we use ebitda and ebitdar as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  and to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors 
we typically use ebitda and ebitdar to compare the operating performance of each skilled nursing and assisted living facility 
ebitda and ebitdar are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  and  with respect to ebitdar  facility rent cost of services  which may vary from period to period depending upon various factors  including the method used to finance facilities  the amount of debt that we have incurred  whether a facility is owned or leased  the date of acquisition of a facility or business  or the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates 
as a result  we believe that the use of ebitda and ebitdar provide a meaningful and consistent comparison of our business between periods by eliminating certain items required by gaap 
we also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our facility level employees that are partially based upon the achievement of ebitdar targets 
despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business  designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting  ebitda and ebitdar are non gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning defined by gaap 
therefore  our ebitda and ebitdar measures have limitations as 
table of contents analytical tools  and they should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the net interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and ebitdar do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using them only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with gaap in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because these non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
see item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a provider of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care services through the operation of facilities located in california  arizona  texas  washington  colorado  utah and idaho 
all of these facilities are skilled nursing facilities  other than three stand alone assisted living facilities in arizona  colorado and texas and five campuses that offer both skilled nursing and assisted living  independent living or hospice care services in california  arizona and texas 
our facilities provide a broad spectrum of skilled nursing and assisted living services  physical  occupational and speech therapies  and other rehabilitative and healthcare services  for both long term residents and short stay rehabilitation patients 
we encourage and empower our facility leaders and staff to make their facility the facility of choice in the community it serves 
this means that our facility leaders and staff are generally free to discern and address the unique needs and priorities of healthcare professionals  customers and other stakeholders in the local community or market  and then work to create a superior service offering and reputation for that particular community or market to encourage prospective customers and referral sources to choose or recommend the facility 
as of december   we operated facilities  of which we owned and operated an additional facilities under long term lease arrangements  and had options to purchase for eight of those facilities 
the following table summarizes our facilities and licensed and independent living beds by ownership status as of december  leased with a leased without a owned purchase option purchase option total number of facilities percent of total operational skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living beds percent of total the ensign group  inc is a holding company with no direct operating assets  employees or revenues 
all of our facilities and operations are operated by separate  wholly owned  independent subsidiaries  which have their own management  employees and assets 
in addition  one of our wholly owned independent subsidiaries  which we call our service center  provides centralized accounting  payroll  human resources  information technology  legal  risk management and other services to each operating subsidiary through contractual relationships between such subsidiaries 
in addition  we have the captive that provides some claims made coverage to our operating subsidiaries for general and professional liability  as well as for certain workers compensation insurance liabilities 
references herein to the consolidated company and its assets and activities  as well as the use of the terms we  us  our and similar verbiage in this annual report is not meant to imply that the ensign group  inc has direct operating assets  employees or revenue  or that any of the facilities  business operations  the service center or the captive are operated by the same entity 
recent developments during the first quarter of  we acquired five skilled nursing facilities  one skilled nursing facility which also has the capacity to provide assisted living and independent living services and one assisted living facility 
the aggregate purchase price of six of the seven facilities was million 
we acquired the remaining facility pursuant to a long term lease arrangement with the real property owner of the facility 
in this transaction  we assumed ownership of the skilled nursing operating business at this facility for approximately million 
these acquisitions added an aggregate of operational skilled nursing  operational assisted living and independent living beds to our operations 

table of contents on september   the lease on one of our assisted living facilities in arizona expired and we decided not to exercise our renewal option on this facility 
as the operations of this facility were not material to us as a whole  the disposal of this facility was not shown as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we acquired eight skilled nursing facilities  one of which also has the capacity to provide independent living and hospice services  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
of the million  million was paid in cash and approximately million was financed through a short term loan with the one of the sellers 
these acquisitions added  operational skilled nursing beds  independent living units and hospice care services to our operations 
we also entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior tenant as part of each transaction 
on december   we purchased the underlying assets of one of our leased skilled nursing facilities in salt lake city  utah 
this facility was purchased for approximately million  which was paid in cash 
on january   we purchased two skilled nursing facilities in idaho for approximately million  which was paid in cash 
this acquisition added operational beds to our operations 
we also entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior tenant as part of this transaction 
see further discussion of facility acquisitions in note to the consolidated financial statements below 
key performance indicators we manage our skilled nursing business by monitoring key performance indicators that affect our financial performance 
these indicators and their definitions include the following routine revenue routine revenue is generated by the contracted daily rate charged for all contractually inclusive services 
the inclusion of therapy and other ancillary treatments varies by payor source and by contract 
services provided outside of the routine contractual agreement are recorded separately as ancillary revenue  including medicare part b therapy services  and are not included in the routine revenue definition 
skilled revenue the amount of routine revenue generated from patients in our skilled nursing facilities who are receiving higher levels of care under medicare  managed care  medicaid  or other skilled reimbursement programs 
the other skilled residents that are included in this population represent very high acuity residents who are receiving high levels of nursing and ancillary services which are reimbursed by payors other than medicare or managed care 
skilled revenue excludes any revenue generated from our assisted living services 
skilled mix the amount of our skilled revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
skilled mix in days represents the number of days our medicare  managed care  or other skilled patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients less days from assisted living services from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
quality mix the amount of routine non medicaid revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
quality mix in days represents the number of days our non medicaid patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
average daily rates the routine revenue by payor source for a period at our skilled nursing facilities divided by actual patient days for that revenue source for that given period 
occupancy percentage operational beds the total number of residents occupying a bed in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility as a percentage of the beds in a facility which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
number of facilities and operational beds the total number of skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living facilities that we own or operate and the total number of operational beds associated with these facilities 

table of contents skilled and quality mix 
like most skilled nursing providers  we measure both patient days and revenue by payor 
medicare  managed care and other skilled patients  whom we refer to as high acuity patients  typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care 
accordingly  medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors 
in most states  medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types 
changes in the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability 
the following table summarizes our overall skilled mix and quality mix for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total routine revenue less revenue from assisted living services and as a percentage of total patient days less days from assisted living services year ended december  skilled mix days revenue quality mix days revenue occupancy 
we define occupancy as the ratio of actual patient days one patient day equals one resident occupying one bed for one day during any measurement period to the number of beds in facilities which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort  and larger wards have been reduced to conform to changes in medicare requirements 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
we define occupancy in operational beds as the ratio of actual patient days during any measurement period to the number of available patient days for that period 
we believe that reporting occupancy based on operational beds is consistent with industry practices and provides a more useful measure of actual occupancy performance from period to period 
the following table summarizes our occupancy statistics for the periods indicated year ended december  occupancy operational beds at end of period available patient days actual patient days occupancy percentage based on operational beds revenue sources our total revenue represents revenue derived primarily from providing services to patients and residents of skilled nursing facilities  and to a lesser extent from assisted living facilities and ancillary services 
we receive service revenue from medicaid  medicare  private payors and other third party payors  and managed care sources 
the sources and amounts of our revenue are determined by a number of factors  including bed capacity and occupancy rates of our healthcare facilities  the mix of patients at our facilities and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
payment for ancillary services varies based upon the service provided and the type of payor 
the 
table of contents following table sets forth our total revenue by payor source and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands revenue medicaid custodial medicare medicaid skilled total managed care private and other total revenue includes revenue from assisted living facilities 
primary components of expense cost of services exclusive of facility rent and depreciation and amortization shown separately 
our cost of services represents the costs of operating our facilities and primarily consists of payroll and related benefits  supplies  purchased services  and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to residents 
cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance and other general cost of services with respect to our facilities 
facility rent cost of services 
facility rent cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to third party owners of the facilities that we operate but do not own and does not include taxes  insurance  impounds  capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our administrative service center personnel  including training and other operational support 
general and administrative expense also includes professional fees including accounting and legal fees  costs relating to our information systems  stock based compensation and rent for our service center office 
depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
the following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets buildings and improvements to years leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life  generally to years furniture and equipment to years critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis we review our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes  stock compensation  intangible assets and loss contingencies 
we base our 
table of contents estimates and judgments upon our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four conditions have been met i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue is derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we record revenue from these governmental and managed care programs as services are performed at their expected net realizable amounts under these programs 
our revenue from governmental and managed care programs is subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by governmental and third party agencies 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  any changes to these governmental revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlements 
we recorded retroactive adjustments that increased revenue by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we record revenue from private pay patients as services are performed 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans and private payor sources 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type and the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors 
the percentages applied to the aged receivable balances are based on the company s historical experience and time limits  if any  for managed care  medicare and medicaid 
we periodically refine our procedures for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience with the estimation process and changes in circumstances 
self insurance we are partially self insured for general and professional liability up to a base amount per claim the self insured retention with an aggregate  one time deductible above this limit 
losses beyond these amounts are insured through third party policies with coverage limits per occurrence  per location and on an aggregate basis for the company 
for claims made after april   the combined self insured retention and corridor was million per claim with a million deductible 
as of april   for all facilities except those located in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence  million per facility with a million blanket aggregate and an additional state specific aggregate where required by state law 
in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence and million per facility  which is independent of the million blanket aggregate applicable to our other facilities 
the self insured retention and deductible limits for general and professional liability and worker s compensation in california are self insured through the captive  the related assets and liabilities of which are included in 
table of contents the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the captive is subject to certain statutory requirements as an insurance provider 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  maintaining statutory capital 
our policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds  as well as an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we develop information about the size of the ultimate claims based on historical experience  current industry information and actuarial analysis  and evaluates the estimates for claim loss exposure on a quarterly basis 
accrued general liability and professional malpractice liabilities recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our operating subsidiaries are self insured for workers compensation liability in california 
to protect itself against loss exposure in california  with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
in texas  the operating subsidiaries have elected non subscriber status for workers compensation claims 
our operating subsidiaries in other states have third party guaranteed cost coverage 
in california and texas  we accrue amounts equal to the estimated costs to settle open claims  as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we use actuarial valuations to estimate the liability based on historical experience and industry information 
accrued workers compensation liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we provide self insured medical including prescription drugs and dental healthcare benefits to the majority of its employees 
we are fully liable for all financial and legal aspects of these benefit plans 
to protect ourselves against loss exposure with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each covered person  which resets every plan year or a lifetime maximum of million per each covered person s lifetime on the ppo and epo plans 
the aforementioned coverage only applies to claims paid during the plan year 
our accrued liability under these plans recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care  workers compensation  healthcare benefits and related services provided to date 
the amount of our reserves was determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
this estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we  with the assistance of an independent actuary  develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims 
it is possible  however  that the actual liabilities may exceed our estimate of loss 
the self insured liabilities are based upon estimates  and while management believes that the estimates of loss are reasonable  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the recorded amounts 
due to the inherent volatility of actuarially determined loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in estimated losses that could be material to net income 
if our actual liability exceeds its estimates of loss  its future earnings and financial condition would be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets that are held and used in our operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing management s best estimate  appropriate assumptions  and projections at the time 
if the carrying value is determined to be unrecoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset 
we estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated future discounted cash flows of the asset 
management has evaluated its long lived assets and has not identified any impairment during the years ended december   or 
table of contents intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of favorable lease  lease acquisition costs  patient base and trade names 
favorable leases and lease acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the lease of the facility  typically ranging from ten to years 
patient base is amortized over a period of three to eight months  depending on the classification of the patients and the level of occupancy in a new acquisition on the acquisition date 
trade names are amortized over years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is subject to annual testing for impairment 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we define reporting units as the individual facilities 
we perform our annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
we did not record any impairment charges during the years ended december    or stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values  ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
net income has been reduced as a result of the recognition of the fair value of all stock options issued on and subsequent to january   the amount of which is contingent upon the number of future options granted and other variables 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates in effect when such temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we generally expect to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  however  when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the annual income tax rate for the financial statements for interim periods  we must consider expected annual income  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax recognition of income or expense and other factors 
when we take uncertain income tax positions  we record a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties  if any 
in considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for such positions  we must consider the potential outcomes from a review of the positions by taxing authorities 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the annual income tax rate for interim periods  or the need for and magnitude of liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with knowledge and expertise in certain fields 
due to certain risks associated with our estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from the determinations we make 
leases and leasehold improvements at the inception of each lease  we perform an evaluation to determine whether the lease should be classified as an operating or capital lease 
we record rent expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we are given control of the leased premises through the end of the lease term 
the lease term used for this evaluation also provides the basis for establishing depreciable lives for buildings subject to lease and leasehold improvements  as well as the period over which we record straight line rent expense 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in january the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of level and inputs and separate disclosures about purchases sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
the new requirements clarify existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
these requirements are effective for the first reporting period  including interim periods  beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchase  sales  issuance  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of these requirements is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standard codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the codification as a single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap was launched july  the codification does not change current gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the codification became effective for us in the interim period ending september   and as a result all references made to gaap use the new codification numbering system prescribed by the fasb 
however  as the codification is not intended to change existing gaap  it did not have an impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued subsequent events 
these standards are effective prospectively for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  our adoption of these standards during the second quarter of fiscal year had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have evaluated subsequent events through february   the date of our issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new standards that defined fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and required enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
this framework became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb delayed the effective date of the fair value framework for non financial assets and liabilities  other than those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  in addition  in october  the fasb clarified the application of the fair value framework in an inactive market and to illustrate how an entity would determine fair value in an inactive market 
our adoption of the fair value framework for non financial assets and liabilities in had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised the requirements for accounting for business combinations which require companies to record most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination at full fair value 
the revised guidelines require companies to record fair value estimates of contingent consideration and certain other potential liabilities during the original purchase price allocation and to expense acquisition costs as incurred 
these requirements apply to all business combinations  including combinations by contract alone 
further  all business combinations are to be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
the revised business combination accounting standards are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we adopted the revised business combination accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal year see note for a description of the impact of this adoption on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued new standards that required noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
these guidelines apply to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with non controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements and are to be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date except that comparative period 
table of contents information must be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity  attribute net income and other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests  and provide other required disclosures 
our adoption of accounting for noncontrolling interests at the beginning of fiscal year had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and therefore the issuing entity is required to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share 
this determination affects entities that accrue cash dividends on share based payment awards during the awards service period when the dividends do not need to be returned if the employees forfeit the awards 
this ruling is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
our adoption of this conclusion at the beginning of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

the million increase in same facility cost of services was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits  partially offset by a reduction in contract nursing services of million  a million increase in insurance costs and a million increase in ancillary expenses 
the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to increases in nursing wages and benefits  a portion of which was attributable to replacing contract nursing labor with full time employees 
the increase in insurance costs was primarily a result of increased self insured general and professional liability due to an increase in the level of self insured deductible and higher actuarial projections for future claim settlements and increased medical and dental healthcare benefits due to an increase in current and projected claims 
the increase in ancillary expenses is primarily due to increased therapy wages

approximately million of the total revenue increase was due to revenue generated by recently acquired facilities  which was primarily attributable to the increase in actual patient days due to the effect of having a year of operations in at facilities acquired in  complimented by higher skilled mix and quality mix at such facilities 
this growth was hindered in part by generally lower occupancy rates 
historically  we have generally experienced lower occupancy rates  lower skilled mix and quality mix in recently acquired facilities  and in the future  if we acquire additional facilities into our overall portfolio  we expect this trend to continue

our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted of bank term deposits  money market funds and treasury bill related investments 
in addition  as of december   we held debt security investments of approximately million  which are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program upon maturity 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

in march  we and certain of our officers received a series of notices from our bank indicating that the united states attorney for the central district of california had issued an authorized investigative demand  a request for records similar to a subpoena  to our bank 
the us attorney subsequently rescinded that demand 
the rescinded demand requested documents from our bank related to financial transactions involving us  ten of our operating subsidiaries  an outside investor group  and certain of our current and former officers 
subsequently  in june  the us attorney sent a letter to one of our current employees requesting a meeting 
the letter indicated that the us attorney and the us department of health and human services office of inspector general were conducting an investigation of claims submitted to the medicare program for rehabilitation services provided at unspecified facilities 
although both we and the employee offered to cooperate  the us attorney later withdrew its meeting request 
on december   we were informed by deloitte touche llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  that the us attorney served a grand jury subpoena on deloitte touche llp  relating to the ensign group  inc  and several of our operating subsidiaries 
the subpoena confirmed our previously reported belief that the us attorney was conducting an investigation involving facilities operated by certain of our operating subsidiaries 
all together  the march authorized investigative demand and the december subpoena specifically covered information from a total of of our facilities 
in february  the us attorney contacted two additional current employees 
both we and the employees contacted have offered to cooperate and meet with the us attorney  however  to date  the us attorney has declined these offers 
we also continue to 
table of contents sporadically receive anecdotal reports of former employees who have been contacted by investigators from the us attorney s office 
based on these events  we believe that the us attorney may be conducting parallel criminal  civil and administrative investigations involving the ensign group  inc and one or more of our skilled nursing facilities 
pursuant to these investigations  on december   representatives from the us department of justice doj served search warrants on our service center and six of our southern california skilled nursing facilities 
following the execution of the warrants on the six facilities  a subpoena was issued covering eight additional facilities 
among other things  the warrants covered specific patient records at the six facilities 
on may   the us attorney served a second subpoena requesting additional patient records on the same patients who were covered by the original warrants 
we have worked with the us attorney s office to produce information responsive to both subpoenas 
we and our regulatory counsel continue to actively work with the us attorney s office to determine what additional information  if any  will be assistive 
we are cooperating with the us attorney s office  and will continue working with them to the extent they will allow us to help move their inquiry forward 
to our knowledge  however  neither the ensign group  inc nor any of our operating subsidiaries or employees has been formally charged with any wrongdoing 
we cannot predict or provide any assurance as to the possible outcome of the investigation or any possible related proceedings  or as to the possible outcome of any qui tam litigation that may follow  nor can we estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from any such proceedings and  therefore  we have not recorded any related accruals 
to the extent the us attorney s office elects to pursue this matter  or if the investigation has been instigated by a qui tam relator who elects to pursue the matter  and we are subjected to or alleged to be liable for claims or obligations under federal medicare statutes  the federal false claims act  or similar state and federal statutes and related regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
we initiated an internal investigation in november when we became aware of an allegation of possible reimbursement irregularities at one or more of our facilities 
this investigation focused on facilities  and included all six of the facilities which were covered by the warrants served in december we retained outside counsel to assist us in looking into these matters 
we and our outside counsel concluded this investigation in february without identifying any systemic or patterns and practices of fraudulent or intentional misconduct 
we made observations at certain facilities regarding areas of potential improvement in some of our recordkeeping and billing practices and have implemented measures  some of which were already underway before the investigation began  that we believe will strengthen our recordkeeping and billing processes 
none of these additional findings or observations appears to be rooted in fraudulent or intentional misconduct 
we continue to evaluate the measures we have implemented for effectiveness  and we are continuing to seek ways to improve these processes 
as a byproduct of our investigation we identified a limited number of selected medicare claims for which adequate backup documentation could not be located or for which other billing deficiencies existed 
we  with the assistance of independent consultants experienced in medicare billing  completed a billing review on these claims 
to the extent missing documentation was not located  we treated the claims as overpayments 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  we record any charge for refunded payments against revenue in the period in which the claim adjustment becomes known 
during the year ended december   we accrued a liability of approximately million  plus interest  for selected medicare claims for which documentation has not been located or for other billing deficiencies identified to date 
these claims have been submitted for settlement with the medicare fiscal intermediary 
if additional reviews result in identification and quantification of additional amounts to be refunded  we would accrue additional liabilities for claim costs and interest  and repay any amounts due in normal course 
if future investigations ultimately result in findings of significant billing and reimbursement noncompliance which could require us to record significant additional provisions or remit payments  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
see additional description of our contingencies in notes  and in notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inflation we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare program 
we also derive revenue from state medicaid and similar reimbursement programs 
payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state s fiscal year for the medicaid programs and in each october for the medicare program 
these adjustments may not continue in the future  and even if received  such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services 
labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services 
those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
to date  we have generally been able to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses 
we may not be successful in offsetting future cost increases 
off balance sheet and other arrangements as of december  and  we had approximately million of borrowing capacity on the revolver pledged as collateral to secure outstanding letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes in connection with the revolver  which is available but is not regularly used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to provide more predictability to our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although the revolver is available and could be used for short term borrowing purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding floating rate debt  however  beginning in  approximately million of the six project loan will be floating rate debt 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted of bank term deposits  money market funds and treasury bill related investments 
in addition  as of december   we held debt security investments of approximately million which are guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program upon maturity 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because our investments are in cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the above only incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
if we diversify our investment portfolio into securities and other investment alternatives  we may face increased risk and exposures as a result of interest risk and the securities markets in general
