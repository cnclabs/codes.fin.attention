item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the part i  item a risks factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products targeting the extracellular matrix for the endocrinology  oncology  dermatology and drug delivery markets 
our existing products and our products under development are based on intellectual property covering the family of human enzymes known as hyaluronidases 
hyaluronidases are enzymes proteins that break down hyaluronan  or ha  which is a naturally occurring space filling  gel like substance that is a major component of both normal tissues throughout the body  such as skin and cartilage  and abnormal tissues such as tumors 
our primary technology is based on our proprietary recombinant human ph enzyme  or rhuph  a human synthetic version of hyaluronidase 
the ph enzyme is a naturally occurring enzyme that temporarily degrades ha  thereby facilitating the penetration and diffusion of other drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle 
our proprietary rhuph technology is applicable to multiple therapeutic areas and may be used to both expand existing markets and create new ones for the development of our own proprietary products 
the rhuph technology may also be applied to existing and developmental products of third parties through key partnerships 

table of contents our operations to date have involved organizing and staffing our operating subsidiary  halozyme  inc  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking product development for our existing products and a limited number of product candidates 
we continue to increase our focus on our proprietary product pipeline and have expanded investments in our proprietary product candidates 
we currently have multiple proprietary programs in various stages of research and development 
in addition  we have entered into a key partnership with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd and hoffmann la roche  inc  or roche  to apply enhanze tm technology to roche s biological therapeutic compounds for up to targets 
we have also entered into two key partnerships with baxter healthcare corporation  or baxter  to apply enhanze technology to baxter s biological therapeutic compound  gammagard liquid tm and to develop and supply active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  for hylenex  a registered trademark of baxter international  inc there are two marketed products that utilize our technology hylenex  a product used as an adjuvant to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids  and cumulase  a product used for in vitro fertilization  or ivf 
currently  we receive only limited revenue from the sales of hylenex and from the sales of api to the third party that produces cumulase  in addition to other revenues from our partnerships with baxter and roche 
we have product candidates in the research  preclinical and clinical stages  but future revenues from the sales of these product candidates will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize product candidates 
it may be years  if ever  before we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for these product candidates 
we have incurred net operating losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we currently have an effective universal shelf registration statement which allows us to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities and we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
collaborative partnerships roche partnership in december  halozyme and roche entered into an enhanze technology partnership  or the roche partnership 
under the terms of the roche partnership  roche obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with up to thirteen roche target compounds resulting from the collaboration 
roche initially had the exclusive right to apply rhuph to only three pre defined roche biologic targets with the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional ten targets 
roche elected to add a fourth exclusive target to the three original exclusive targets in december and a fifth exclusive target in june compounds directed at three of the roche exclusive targets are currently in clinical trials 
two compounds are in phase clinical trials  and the third compound is in a phase clinical trial 
in october  we announced the commencement of the first phase clinical trial for a compound directed at an exclusive target 
this phase clinical trial is for a subcutaneously delivered version of roche s anticancer biologic  herceptin trastuzumab 
the study will investigate the pharmacokinetics  efficacy and safety of subcutaneous herceptin in patients with her positive breast cancer as part of adjuvant treatment 
herceptin is approved to treat her positive breast cancer and currently is given intravenously 
breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide 
each year more than one million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide  and nearly  people will die of the disease annually 
in her positive breast cancer  increased quantities of the her protein are present on the surface of the tumor cells 
this is known as her positivity and affects approximately of women with breast cancer 
in september  roche began a phase clinical trial for a subcutaneous formulation of mabthera rituximab 
the study will investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of subcutaneous mabthera in patients with follicular lymphoma as part of maintenance treatment 
intravenously administered mabthera is approved for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl  a type of cancer that affects lymphocytes  or white blood cells 
an estimated  new cases of nhl were diagnosed in the us in with approximately  new cases reported worldwide 

table of contents additional information about the phase subcutaneous herceptin and phase subcutaneous mabthera clinical trials can be found at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov and www 
roche trials 
com 
roche retains the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional eight targets through the payment of annual license maintenance fees 
pending the successful completion of various clinical  regulatory and sales events  roche will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of products that result from the partnership 
baxter gammagard partnership gammagard liquid is a current baxter product that is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with defects in the immune system 
in september  halozyme and baxter entered into an enhanze technology partnership  or the gammagard partnership 
under the terms of this partnership  baxter obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with gammagard liquid 
pending the successful completion of various regulatory and sales milestones  baxter will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of products that result from the partnership 
baxter is responsible for all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs under the gammagard partnership  while we will be responsible for the supply of the rhuph enzyme 
in addition  baxter has certain product development and commercialization obligations in major markets identified in the gammagard license 
in january of  we announced the commencement of a phase clinical trial for gammagard liquid with rhuph  and in july  we announced the completion of enrollment for this study 
hylenex partnership hylenex is a formulation of rhuph that  when injected under the skin  facilitates the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs or fluids 
in february  halozyme and baxter amended certain existing agreements relating to hylenex and entered into a new agreement for kits and formulations with rhuph  or the hylenex partnership 
pending the successful completion of a series of regulatory and sales events  baxter will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of products that result from the partnership 
baxter is responsible for development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs of the products covered by the hylenex partnership 
we will continue to supply baxter with api for hylenex  and baxter will prepare  fill  finish and package hylenex and hold it for subsequent distribution 
in october  baxter announced the commercial launch of hylenex recombinant hyaluronidase human injection for use in pediatric rehydration at the american college of emergency physicians acep scientific assembly boston 
in addition  under the hylenex partnership  baxter has a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with baxter hydration fluids and generic small molecule drugs  with the exception of combinations with i bisphosphonates  ii cytostatic and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and iii proprietary small molecule drugs  the rights to which have been retained by halozyme 
revenues revenues from product sales depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our products and product candidates 
revenues from license and collaboration agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before they are earned 
nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreement  assuming we meet certain criteria 
royalty revenues from the sale of licensed products are recognized upon the sale of such products 
elements of our collaborative partnerships include nonrefundable license fees  reimbursements of research and development services  various clinical  regulatory or sales milestones and future product based or royalty payments  as applicable 
due to our ongoing involvement obligations under these partnerships  we recorded the 
table of contents nonrefundable license fees and annual license maintenance fees as deferred revenues 
such revenues are being recognized over the terms of the underlying agreements that define the terms of the partnerships 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  and freight costs associated with the sales of cumulase  api for cumulase and the api for hylenex 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  research related manufacturing services  clinical trials  contract research services  supplies and materials  facilities and other overhead costs and other outside expenses 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates 
since our inception in through december   we have incurred research and development expenses of million 
from january  through december   approximately and of our research and development expenses were associated with the development of our ultrafast insulin and pegph product candidates  respectively 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining the us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals  our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our product candidates advance into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make ongoing determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to existing resource levels  the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate  and other market and regulatory developments 
we plan on focusing our resources on those proprietary and partnered product candidates that represent the most valuable economic and strategic opportunities 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  or if  our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  accounting and legal fees  other professional services expenses  marketing expenses  as well as other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable fees at the inception of the agreements  license fees  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales revenues from the sales of cumulase and api for cumulase are recognized when the transfer of ownership occurs  which is upon shipment to our distributor 
we are obligated to accept returns for product that does not meet product specifications 
historically  we have not had any product returns as a result of not meeting product specifications 
under the terms of the hylenex partnership  we supply baxter the api for hylenex at our fully burdened cost plus a margin 
baxter fills and finishes hylenex and holds it for subsequent distribution  at which time we ensure it meets product specifications and release it as available for sale 
because of our continued involvement in the development and production process of hylenex  the earnings process is not considered to be complete 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and related product costs on the api for hylenex until the product is filled  finished  packaged and released 
baxter may only return the api for hylenex to us if it does not conform to certain specified criteria set forth in the hylenex partnership or upon termination of such agreement 
we have historically demonstrated that the api shipped to baxter has consistently met the specified criteria  therefore  no allowance for product returns has been established 
in addition  we receive product based payments upon the sale of hylenex by baxter  in accordance with the terms of the hylenex partnership 
product sales revenues are recognized as we earn such revenues based on baxter s shipments of hylenex to its distributors when such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
baxter has prepaid million of product based payments 
the prepaid product based payments were initially deferred and are being recognized as product sales revenue as the company earns such revenue from the sales of hylenex by baxter 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues from collaborative and licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before they are earned 
nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees  in which we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the fees are nonrefundable and our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
reimbursements of research and development services are recognized as revenue during the period in which the services are performed 
royalties to be received based on sales of licensed products by our collaborators incorporating our products are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements 
share based payments we use the fair value method to account for share based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance for stock compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 

table of contents expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance on stock compensation using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  research related manufacturing services  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
advance payments  including nonrefundable amounts  for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts will be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or such time that the company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
milestone payments that we make in connection with in licensed technology or product candidates are expensed as incurred when there is uncertainty in receiving future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates 
we consider the future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain until such licensed technology or product candidates are approved for marketing by regulatory bodies such as the fda or when other significant risk factors are abated 
management has viewed future economic benefits for all of our licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain and has expensed these amounts for accounting purposes 
payments in connection with our clinical trials are often made under contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee  unit price or on a time and material basis 
payments under these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment or treatment of patients or the completion of other clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates and or representations from service providers regarding work performed  including actual level of patient enrollment  completion of patient studies and clinical trials progress 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain 
if the contracted amounts are modified for instance  as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
revisions in scope of contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain 
because of the uncertainty of possible future changes to the scope of work in clinical trials contracts  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
historically  we have had no material changes in our clinical trial expense accruals that would have had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents inventory inventory consists of raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand related to our hylenex and cumulase products 
inventory is valued at lower of cost or market net realizable value using the first in  first out method 
inventory is reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
to the extent that its net realizable value is lower than cost  an impairment would be recorded 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii item of this report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues under collaborative agreements revenues under collaborative agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million or 
revenues under collaborative agreements primarily consisted of the amortization of license fees and milestone payments received from roche and baxter of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
revenues under collaborative agreements also included reimbursements for research and development services from roche of million and million and baxter of million and million in and  respectively 
such reimbursements are for research and development services rendered by us at the request of roche and baxter and the amount of future revenues related to reimbursable research and development services is uncertain 
we expect the non reimbursement revenues under our collaborative agreements to continue to increase in future periods provided that we meet various clinical and regulatory milestones set forth in such agreements 
product sales product sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to the increases in sales of hylenex and cumulase 
based upon baxter s launch of hylenex in the fourth quarter of and potential supply shortages for similar products  we expect product sales to increase in future periods due to increased hylenex sales 
cost of sales cost of sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was mainly due to the decrease in the cost of cumulase sales in we expect cost of sales to increase as product sales also increase 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the increases in activities supporting our ultrafast insulin program of million and pegph program of million

as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested stock options and restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents interest income interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalent balances in as compared to the same period in net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses  partially offset by increases in revenues 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
we will continue to have significant cash requirements to support our product development activities 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the success of our clinical development programs  regulatory and market acceptance  and the resources we devote to research and other commercialization activities 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we anticipate total net cash burn of approximately to million for the year ending december   depending on the progress of various preclinical and clinical programs  the timing of our manufacturing scale up and the achievement of various milestones under our existing collaborative agreements 
we do not expect our revenues to be sufficient to fund operations for at least several years 
we expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources  anticipated revenues from our existing collaborations and cash that we will raise through future transactions 
we may finance future cash needs through any one of the following financing vehicles i the public offering of securities  ii new collaborative agreements  iii expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships  iv private financings  and or v other equity or debt financings 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
which allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities 
we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
in june  we sold approximately million of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share under a prior shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
which was filed in november our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be adequate to fund our operations until we become cash flow positive  if ever 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  financing will be obtained on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  delay the launch of our product candidates  if approved  and or restructure our operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
operating activities net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of net cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to increased operating expenses of approximately million and timing of accounts payable payments  partially offset by increased partnership payments of approximately million during as compared to net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to  of net cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to increased operating expenses of approximately million as well as reduced receipts from partnership payments of approximately million during as compared to 
table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in june and million from warrant and stock option exercises

net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of approximately million in proceeds  net of issuance costs  from sales of our common stock and approximately million in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license payments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for outsourced research and development services for our various preclinical and clinical programs  for the manufacturing of our products for clinical and commercial use and other recurring purchases and services made in the normal course of business 
as of december   we had no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities  the number and scope of our research activities  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain product discovery and development collaborations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we typically invest all  or substantially all  of our cash in money market funds that invest primarily in government securities 
our investment policy also permits investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other investments that we believe to be highly liquid
