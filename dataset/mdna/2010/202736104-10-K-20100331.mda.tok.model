in addition  as evidenced by a major increase in our loan losses  a continuation of the recent turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could continue to negatively impact our performance  both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally 
dramatic declines in the housing market in the past two years have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions in the united states 
concerns about the stability of the us financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity  and increased market volatility 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment  both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive landscape 

table of contents results of operations and financial condition of commonwealth bankshares  inc and subsidiaries overview throughout  difficult economic conditions continued to have a negative impact on businesses and consumers in our market area 
this unprecedented economic environment has continued to negatively impact our loan portfolio  in particular commercial relationships secured by real estate 
the financial weakening within the commercial real estate sector has resulted in significant deterioration in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  which is reflected by increases in non performing and internally risk classified loans 
in response to the prolonged economic downturn  continued economic uncertainties and the completion of an examination of the bank conducted by the frb  management and the board elected to provide an additional million to the bank s allowance for loan losses during the year ended december  this is an increase of million over the comparable period in addressing troubled credits quickly and conservatively has always been  and will continue to be  a top priority

significant categories of earning assets are loans and investment securities  while deposits and short term borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is impacted primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates when compared to previous periods of operations 
table presents the average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  the average yields earned on such assets on a tax equivalent basis and rates paid on such liabilities  and the net interest margin for the indicated periods

table of contents the net interest margin is calculated by expressing tax equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets  and represents the company s net yield on its earning assets 
net interest margin is an indicator of the company s effectiveness in generating income from its earning assets 
the net interest margin is affected by the structure of the balance sheet as well as by competition and the economy 
the spread that can be earned between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is also dependent to a large extent on the slope of the yield curve

as of december   the net interest margin was compared to recorded in and in the yield on our interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in contributing to the compression of our margins was the decrease in interest rates  along with the continued pressure on deposit pricing and the pricing of some deposit products which lag the decrease in the prime rate  which has an immediate affect on variable loans 
in addition  the competiveness for deposits resulting from the reduction in liquidity throughout the financial markets has kept rates at a high level relative to loan rates 
also contributing to the compression of our margins was the increase in the balance of non accruing loans and the increased liquidity invested in overnight funds 
a shift in the mix of funding sources was also a factor in the decline in the net interest margin

credit risk arises through the extension of loans  leases  certain securities and financial guarantees 
to manage this risk  the company establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the company 
the company s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of maintaining an allowance for inherent credit losses 
the amount of the provision each year and the level of the allowance are matters of judgment and are impacted by many factors  including actual credit losses during the period  the prospective view of credit losses  loan performance measures and trends such as delinquencies and charge offs  the economic environment and other factors  both internal and external that may affect the quality and future loss experience of the credit portfolio 
the company continuously reviews its loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
in addition to the review of credit quality through an ongoing credit review process and a monthly review of impaired loans by management and the board  the company constructs a comprehensive allowance analysis for its loan portfolio at least quarterly 
this analysis includes three basic elements  a general allowance  specific allowances for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance representing estimations done pursuant to either financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic accounting for contingencies  or fasb asc topic accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
such qualitative factors management considers are the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  including adverse circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal  the estimated value of collateral  an analysis of the levels and trends of delinquencies  level of concentrations and growth within the portfolio  and the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
management s evaluation and resulting provision and allowance decisions are reviewed by the board of directors quarterly 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries

the housing downturn and the financial market disruptions that began in the second half of continued to affect the economy and the financial services sector throughout and the housing downturn and the broader economic slowdown that accelerated during the second half of negatively impacted the credit quality of both our consumer and commercial portfolios 
the market turbulence and economic uncertainty continued well into  which led to additional provisions for loan losses

notwithstanding these allocations  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge offs in any category of loan 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses december  in thousands construction and development commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage installment loans to individuals other unallocated total allowance for loan losses non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans accounted for on a non accrual basis as judgmentally determined by management based upon anticipated realization of interest income  loans which are contractually past due days and other real estate owned 
it is management s practice to cease accruing interest on loans when payments are days delinquent 
however  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest  and the loan is in the process of collection 
the following table presents information concerning non performing assets for the periods indicated

the increase was reflective of the unprecedented economic environment which continues to negatively impact our loan portfolio  in particular commercial relationships secured by real estate 
million or of total non performing loans consist of loans which are secured by real estate  of which million are construction and development loans 
included in the category of construction and development are condominium projects totaling million and residential lot loans of million 
the company has added personnel to our special assets and credit administration areas to proactively and aggressively identify and address problem assets 
in addition  the company has strengthened its credit administration processes with the addition of a third party loan review team which completed a comprehensive review of the construction  development and commercial real estate loan portfolios  with an emphasis on large loans and problem loans 
this type of comprehensive review will be performed on a semi annual basis for the foreseeable future 
the company has a loan impairment committee to monitor non performing assets  past due loans  identify potential problem credits and develop action plans to work through these loans as promptly as possible 
as all non performing loans are deemed impaired  the committee has individually reviewed the underlying collateral value less cost to sell on each of these loans as a part of its analysis of impaired loans 
as a result of this comprehensive analysis  million in specific reserves for loan losses has been established for non performing loans 
based on current collateral values  we believe our reserve is adequate to cover any short falls resulting from the sale of the underlying collateral 
based on current accounting and regulatory guidelines the company has provided a reserve based on current market values for these impaired loans however  management plans to work with our customers to get through these unprecedented economic times and to minimize any potential credit exposure 
management has taken a proactive approach to monitoring these loans and will continue to actively manage these credits to minimize losses 
non accrual loans at december  totaled million compared to million at december  if all non accrual loans had been performing fully  these loans would have contributed an additional million to interest income in  million in  thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the company is required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as troubled debt restructurings tdr 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a loan constitutes a tdr when we grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
tdr typically result from the company s loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions or other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
as of december   the company s tdr loans totaled million 
of this total  approximately million are in compliance with modified terms  million are days delinquent  thousand are days or more delinquent  and million are classified as non accrual 
there were no tdr loans at any of the previous year ends included in the preceding non performing assets analysis 
other real estate owned oreo at december  was million  compared to million at december   thousand at december  and at each of december  and the balance at december  was comprised of properties of which were residential 
during the twelve months ended december   new foreclosures included properties totaling million  of which million represented residential properties 
oreo sales for the twelve months ended december   consisted of properties resulting in a net loss of thousand 
at december   there were two residential properties under contract for sale 
subsequent to december   one of the residential properties under contract for sale at december  sold resulting in no gain or loss on sale 
the remaining properties are being actively marketed and management does not anticipate any material losses associated with these properties 
as a direct result of the continued decline in the real estate market  the company recorded losses of thousand in its consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december   due to valuation adjustments on oreo properties 
asset quality continues to be a top priority for the company 
we continue to allocate significant resources to the expedient disposition and collection of non performing and other lower quality assets 
uses of funds total average earning assets at december  increased from year end compared with s increase of from year end s increase of 
the increase in average earning assets over the last three years has been primarily attributable to the increase in the loan portfolio which has increased from million in to billion in loan portfolio the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets and accounts for the greatest portion of total interest income 
as of december   total gross loans excluding unearned income  were billion  an million or a increase over year end loan growth experienced from year end to year end was million or  from year end to year end was million or and from year end to year end was million or 
the growth experienced during the past four years was achieved not only by the high loan demand generated by the low interest rate environment  the presence in new markets as a result of our branch expansion  but also by the efforts of the company s officers to develop new loan relationships combined with the support of existing customers 
during  the company raised million in additional capital allowing us to continue our strong growth momentum and allowing us to better serve our customers by increasing our legal lending limit to over million as of december  during the past four years  a considerable volume of new loan relationships have been developed with old line and well established local businesses  who have transferred their relationships to the company from other regional financial institutions that are experiencing further consolidation 
this has been an excellent source of new business for the bank  as customers still value the personal attention traditionally offered by a community bank 
the company s overall objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences 
to achieve this objective  the company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower concentration 
we continue to refine our credit standards to meet the changing economic environment 
we have adjusted our underwriting criteria  
table of contents increased the frequency of portfolio monitoring in certain high risk segments of the portfolio  increased our efforts in managing the credit exposure when we begin to see signs of deterioration  as well as enhanced our collection strategies in an attempt to mitigate losses 
senior level management is devoted to the management and or collection of certain non performing assets as well as certain performing loans 
furthermore  the company has reallocated resources and staff to accomplish the aforementioned initiatives

the company also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects  generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the company 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan 
the term for the company s typical construction loan ranges from nine months to months for the construction of an individual residence  and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the company does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the interest rates on the company s construction loans are mostly variable 
the company does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the company limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record and other factors 
construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the company than residential mortgage loans 
the company attempts to minimize such risks by i making construction loans in accordance with the company s underwriting standards and to established customers in its primary market area and ii by monitoring the quality  progress and cost of construction 
loans in the commercial category  as well as commercial real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term five year or less final maturity or five year rate call and or floating or adjustable rate commercial loans made to small to medium sized companies 
total commercial loans increased to million in compared with an increase of to million in  an increase of to million in and an increase of to million in virtually all of the company s commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans relate to property in our market areas of hampton roads and northeastern north carolina which includes the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina 
as such  they are subject to risks relating to the general economic conditions in those markets  and the market for real estate in particular 
these regions experienced solid economic activity during beginning the second half of and continuing into and  the economy in general declined into a recession 
although our local economy has not experienced the same dramatic decline seen in other regions in the us  our region experienced a significant downturn in real estate values 
in response to the downturn  the company has strengthened our underwriting practices and has been proactively monitoring and managing our existing portfolio

consumer installment loans decreased million or in  representing of total gross loans at december  consumer installment loans represented  and of total gross loans as of december   and  respectively 
to limit credit exposure  the company obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments when deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral are real and personal property  cash on deposit and marketable securities 
the company obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the basis of the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
a number of measures have been taken by the company over the past several years to reduce overall exposure and earnings vulnerability in the real estate sectors of the bank s trade area 
these measures include strengthening real estate underwriting  management review of policies and practices  and reducing higher risk concentrations within the real estate portfolio 

table of contents the following table shows the maturity or period of re pricing of gross loans outstanding as of december  demand loans  as well as loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due within one year 
adjustable and floating rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in which they contractually mature 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which the final contractual repayment is due

total noninterest expense increased to million in or following increases of and in and  respectively 
the ratio of noninterest expense to average total assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost associated with handling our substantial asset and liability growth  including the expansion of our branch network  resulted in increases to almost every component of noninterest expense 
in addition  noninterest expense grew in due to the increased costs related to managing during this economic environment as further discussed below 
a key measure of overhead is the operating efficiency ratio 
the operating efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net bank revenue on a tax equivalent basis 
efficiency gains can be achieved by controlling costs and generating more diverse and higher levels of noninterest revenues along with increasing our margins 
the company s efficiency ratio tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december   compared to in and in for the year ended december   the company s efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by the increase in losses on oreo  expenses related to oreo properties  fdic insurance and legal expense related to loan colletctions 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased by in  following a decrease of in and an increase of in the increase in salaries and employee benefits was the result of the addition of several new positions  including the staff needed to operate the bank s two new branches that opened in late and an increase in certain employee benefit costs

the federal reserve  the office of the controller of the currency and the fdic have issued risk based capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
these guidelines provide a capital framework that is sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking companies 
risk based capital ratios are another measure of capital adequacy 
under federal reserve bank rules  the company and the bank were considered well 
table of contents capitalized  the highest category of capitalization defined by the regulators as of december  the bank s risk adjusted capital ratios at december   were for tier and for total capital  well above the required minimums of and  respectively 
these ratios are calculated using regulatory capital either tier or total capital as the numerator and both on and off balance sheet risk weighted assets as the denominator 
tier capital consists primarily of common equity less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
total capital adds certain qualifying debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses to tier capital 
one of four risk weights  primarily based on credit risk  is applied to both on and off balance sheet assets to determine the asset denominator 
in order to maintain a strong equity capital position and to protect against the risks of loss in the investment and loan portfolios and on other assets  management will continue to monitor the bank s capital position 
several measures have been or will be employed to maintain the bank s capital position  including but not limited to continuing its efforts to return all non performing assets to performing status  monitoring the bank s growth  and continued utilization of its formal asset liability policy 
once again  it should be noted that the bank s capital position has always exceeded and continues to exceed the minimum standards established by the regulatory authorities 
liquidity bank liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash flows to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers promptly and in a cost effective manner 
asset liquidity is provided primarily by maturing loans and investments  and by cash received from operations 
other sources of asset liquidity include readily marketable assets  especially short term investments  and long term investment securities that can serve as collateral for borrowings 
on the liability side  liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed 
the company maintains a liquid portfolio of both assets and liabilities and attempts to mitigate the risk inherent in changing rates in this manner 
cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds sold and investments classified as available for sale totaled  and million as of december   and  respectively 
to provide liquidity for current ongoing and unanticipated needs  the company maintains a portfolio of marketable investment securities  and structures and monitors the flow of funds from these securities and from maturing loans 
the company maintains access to short term funding sources as well  including a federal funds line of credit with one correspondent bank up to million and the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta up to million 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets  and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  including the use of broker certificates of deposit  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositor s requirements and to meet customers credit needs 
the company s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for formulating liquidity strategies  monitoring performance based on established objectives and approving new liquidity initiatives 
alco s overall objective is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity needs  the interest rate and economic outlook  market opportunities and customer requirements 
general strategies to accomplish this objective include maintaining a strong balance sheet  achieving solid core deposit growth  taking on manageable interest rate risk and adhering to conservative financial management on a daily basis 
these strategies are monitored regularly by alco and reviewed periodically with the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations to meet the financing needs of customers  the company is a party  in the normal course of business  to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit 
for further information on off balance commitments see note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  in the consolidated financial statements included as exhibit of this form k 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations  contingent obligations and certain other off balance sheet commitments outstanding as of december  table contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations other liabilities on balance sheet under gaap federal home loan bank advances trust preferred capital notes long term debt off balance sheet commitments standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit total contractual obligations inflation the company carefully reviews federal reserve monetary policy in order to ensure an appropriate position between the cost and utilization of funds 
the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes is directly related to price level indices 
accordingly  management believes the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses 
critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to the company s allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s borrowers to make required loan payments 
if the financial condition of the company s borrowers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company s estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for loan losses is contained in note to consolidated financial statements included as exhibit of this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
based on the nature of the company s operations  it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the hampton roads and northeastern north carolina areas  including the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
as of december   the company does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and re pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the company s management  guided by the alco  determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these decisions are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the national and regional economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
the company uses a variety of traditional and on balance sheet tools to manage its interest rate risk 
gap analysis  which monitors the gap between interest sensitive assets and liabilities  is one such tool 
in addition  the company uses simulation modeling to forecast future balance sheet and income statement behavior 
by studying the effects on net interest income of rising  stable and falling interest rate scenarios  the company can position itself to take advantage of anticipated interest rate movements  and protect itself from unanticipated interest rate movements  by understanding the dynamic nature of its balance sheet components 
earnings simulation analysis management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis  such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends  peer analysis and management s outlook 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 

table of contents different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios 
many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments 
consequently  variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the company for the twelve months following each of the two year ends and  using different rate scenarios change in prime rate change in net interest income change in net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points market value simulation market value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments 
market values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the net market value is the market value of all assets minus the market value of all liabilities 
the change in net market value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term interest rate risk in the balance sheet 
similar assumptions are used in the market value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following table reflects the change in net market value over different rate environments change in prime rate change in net market value change in net market value basis points basis points basis points basis points
