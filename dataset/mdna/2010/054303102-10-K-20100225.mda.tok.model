when used in this discussion  the terms avon  company  we  our or us mean  unless the context otherwise indicates  avon products  inc and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries 
refer to the key performance indicators table on page of this annual report for a description of how constant dollar constant growth rates a non gaap financial measure are determined 
overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in countries and territories  including the us  and distribute products in more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions latin america  north america  central eastern europe  western europe  middle east africa  asia pacific  and china 
we have centralized operations for global brand marketing  global sales and supply chain 
our product categories are beauty  fashion and home 
beauty consists of color cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and personal care 
fashion consists of fashion jewelry  watches  apparel  footwear and accessories 
home consists of gift and decorative products  housewares  entertainment and leisure products and children s and nutritional products 
sales from health and wellness products and mark  a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women  are included among these three categories based on product type 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by approximately million active independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not our employees 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  retaining and servicing our representatives 
we view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage in part because it allows us to participate in higher growth beauty markets internationally 
in developed markets  such as the us  we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market  while in developing and emerging markets  we seek to achieve higher growth targets 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the us at the end of  we launched a comprehensive  multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth 
we have approved and announced all of the initiatives of the restructuring program launched in under the turnaround plan restructuring program 
in  we completed the analysis of our optimal product portfolio and made decisions on exit strategies for non optimal products under our product line simplification program pls 
in  we also launched our strategic sourcing initiative ssi 
we expect our restructuring initiatives under our restructuring program to deliver annualized savings of approximately once all initiatives are fully implemented by we also expect to achieve annualized benefits in excess of from pls and from ssi in in february  we announced a new restructuring program restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan  which targets increasing levels of efficiency and organizational effectiveness across our global operations 
we expect the restructuring initiatives under our restructuring program to deliver annualized savings of approximately once all initiatives are fully implemented by these initiatives and programs are discussed further below 
whenever we refer to annualized savings or annualized benefits  we mean the additional operating profit we expect to realize on a full year basis every year following implementation of the respective initiative as compared with the operating profit we would have expected to achieve without having implemented the initiative 
during  revenue decreased  impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange and the depressed global economy 
constant revenue increased  with increases in all segments except north america and china 
sales from products in the beauty category decreased  due to unfavorable foreign exchange 
on a constant basis  sales of products in the beauty category increased due to a increase in units and a increase in net per unit 
active representatives increased 
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange lowered operating margin by an estimated points approximately points from foreign exchange transactions and approximately points from foreign exchange translation  year over year 
see the segment review section of this md a for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment 
although we expect that the global economic pressures will continue in the foreseeable future  we expect at least mid single digit constant revenue growth during 
table of contents our operating margin will be negatively impacted by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency coupled with a required change to account for operations in venezuela on a highly inflationary basis 
as a result of the devaluation  we expect the company s operating margin to be negatively impacted by approximately of costs associated with the historical cost in us dollars of non monetary assets 
refer to further discussion of venezuela on page of this annual report 
despite the negative impact of the accounting cost from the devaluation of the venezuelan currency  we anticipate the company s operating margin to improve in and to reach mid teen levels by we believe that our strong operating cash flow and global cash balances of approximately billion  coupled with the continuing execution of our turnaround strategies and the competitive advantages of our direct selling business model  will allow us to continue our focus on long term sustainable  profitable growth 
we are also focused on innovating our direct selling channel through technological and service model enhancements for our representatives and assessing new product category opportunities 
we also continue to offer an increased assortment of smart value products  which are quality products at affordable price points  and promote our representative earnings opportunity to a wider audience 
strategic initiatives at the end of  we launched a comprehensive  multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth 
as part of the turnaround plan  we launched our pls and ssi programs 
since  we have identified  and in many case implemented  restructuring initiatives under our and restructuring programs 
we continue to implement certain initiatives under these restructuring programs 
the anticipated savings or benefits realized from these initiatives has funded and will continue to fund our investment in  amongst other things  advertising  market intelligence  consumer research and product innovation 
advertising and representative value proposition rvp investing in advertising is a key strategy 
although we significantly increased spending on advertising over the past three years  during  our investment in advertising decreased by or reflecting improved productivity  general softness in media prices and the benefit of foreign currency translation 
as a percentage of beauty sales  our investment in advertising was flat compared to the advertising investments supported new product launches  such as  anew reversalist serum cream  anew dermafull helix  spectra lash mascara  spectracolor lip  k gold lipstick  supercurlacious mascara and spotlight fragrance 
advertising investments also included advertising to recruit representatives 
we have also continued to forge alliances with celebrities  including alliances with patrick dempsey and reese witherspoon for her in bloom fragrance 
we continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our representatives 
we have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions  and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets 
we have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our representatives 
we measure our investment in rvp as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives 
during  we invested approximately incrementally in our representatives through rvp by continued implementation of our sales leadership program  enhanced incentives  increased sales campaign frequency  improved commissions and new e business tools 
investing in rvp will continue to be a key strategy 
we will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for representatives through various means  including the following evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets  continuing the roll out of our sales leadership program  which offers representatives an enhanced career opportunity  strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance representative economics  recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize representative selling opportunities  applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets  and web enablement for representatives including on line training enhancements 
while the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses  we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce representative effort worldwide 
we will continue to focus on improving internet based tools for our representatives 

table of contents product line simplification during  we began to analyze our product line  under our pls program  to develop a smaller range of better performing  more profitable products 
the continued goal of pls is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products 
during  we completed the analysis of our product portfolio  concluded on the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment such as selling at a discount  donation  or destruction 
during  we recorded pls charges of  primarily for incremental inventory obsolescence expense of although the pls program is ongoing  we recorded final pls charges in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing benefits have and will continue to account for most of our projected benefits 
improving our product assortment will allow us to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure  which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences  easier representative selling experiences  and greater sales per brochure page 
a second source of benefits from pls results from transferable demand 
transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment  some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics 
as part of pls  when we identify products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics  we will eliminate the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit 
a third source of benefits from pls is less price discounting 
as we implement operating procedures under pls  we anticipate introducing fewer new products and lengthening the lifecycle of products in our offering  which we expect will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a product s life cycle 
in addition to the benefits above  we also expect supply chain benefits to account for some of our projected benefits 
we expect improvements to cost of sales once pls is fully implemented  primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels  lower variable spending on warehousing  more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs 
we also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity 
given the nature of these benefits  we estimate that we realized our targeted total benefits from this program of approximately during and approximately in  or incremental benefits of approximately over we expect to realize targeted benefits in excess of in strategic sourcing initiative we launched ssi in this initiative is expected to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials  goods and services 
under this initiative  we are shifting our purchasing strategy from a local  commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes  allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale  utilizes sourcing best practices and processes  and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs 
beyond lower costs  our goals from ssi include improving asset management  service for representatives and vendor relationships 
during  we realized benefits of approximately from ssi 
during  we realized approximately of benefits from ssi  or incremental benefits of approximately over we expect to realize benefits in excess of in we continue to implement a sales and operations planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues 
enterprise resource planning system we are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning erp system  which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes 
we began our gradual global roll out in europe in and have since implemented erp in our european manufacturing facilities  our larger european direct selling operations and in the us as part of this continuing global roll out  we expect to implement erp in several countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations 
during  we worked to improve the effectiveness of erp in the us and began to implement in the other markets within north america  as well as in some smaller european direct selling operations 
during  we also began the multi year implementation process in latin america in one market 
in latin america  we plan to implement modules of erp in a gradual manner across key markets over the next several years 
during  we began delivering on the erp implementation in latin america  with implementation of erp modules in mexico and brazil 
during  we will continue the implementation in a gradual manner across key markets within the region 

table of contents zero overhead growth we have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements 
these improvements in productivity will come primarily from ssi and our restructuring initiatives 
we have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure  and management and administrative activities 
overhead excludes variable expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses  such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization  and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising  rvp  research and development and brochure costs 
restructuring initiatives restructuring program we launched our original restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan in late we have approved and announced all of the initiatives that are part of the restructuring program 
we expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement restructuring initiatives under this program of approximately before taxes 
we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of through december   in  in  in  in and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
the costs to implement restructuring initiatives during through are associated with specific actions  including organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering  taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations  the phased outsourcing of certain services  including certain finance  information technology  human resource and customer service processes  and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers  the restructure of certain international direct selling operations  the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations  including the realignment of certain of our north america and latin america distribution operations  the automation of certain distribution processes  the exit of certain unprofitable operations and product lines  and the reorganization of certain functions  primarily sales related organizations 
actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately in  as compared to savings of approximately in we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately once all initiatives are fully implemented by we expect the savings to reach approximately in restructuring program in february  we announced a new restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan 
the restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program focus on restructuring our global supply chain operations  realigning certain local business support functions to a more regional basis to drive increased efficiencies  and streamlining transaction related services  including selective outsourcing 
we expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement these restructuring initiatives in the range of to before taxes under the restructuring program 
we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of through december   for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately in we are targeting annualized savings under the restructuring program of approximately upon full implementation by we expect the savings to reach approximately in see note  restructuring initiatives  on pages f through f of our annual report 
new accounting standards information relating to new accounting standards is included in note  new accounting standards  of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 

table of contents key performance indicators within this md a  we utilize the key performance indicators kpis defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
kpi definition growth in active representatives this indicator is based on the number of representatives submitting an order in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the growth in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this indicator is equal to the number of days of cost of sales  based on the average of the preceding months  covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
constant non gaap financial measure to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with us gaap  we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 
we refer to these adjusted growth rates as constant growth 
we believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends 
to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate 
currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates 
critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time  involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs  primarily contract termination costs  are recorded when the benefits have been communicated to employees 
one time  voluntary benefit arrangements are recorded when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement 
we evaluate impairment issues if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we estimate the expense for our restructuring initiatives  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority  by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent our best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to us each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances  including selling schedules  business operations  seasonality and changing trends 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense has been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
bad debt expense  as a percent of revenue increased by points in as compared to  caused by an influx of new representatives  who normally have a higher rate of default than established representatives  as well as economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  sales returns have been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was for  for  and for obsolescence expense for included incremental inventory obsolescence charges of  related to our pls program 
obsolescence expense for benefited by approximately from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our pls program 
pension  postretirement and postemployment expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and a portion of employees in international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits subject to certain limitations to the majority of employees in the us and in some foreign countries 
see note  employee benefit plans  to our annual report for further information on our benefit plans 
pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was  compared to for in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan was for the most recent year period and for the year period 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned 
over the year period and over the year period 
the plan assets in the us returned in and lost in the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 

table of contents the weighted average discount rate for us and us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  for the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate  we take into consideration external actuarial advice 
our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above  rate of compensation increase of plan participants  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had pretax actuarial losses and prior service credits totaling for the us plans and for the non us plans that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity 
while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
during  the plan assets experienced significant losses  which were mostly due to unfavorable returns on equity securities 
these unfavorable returns will increase pension cost in future periods 
for  our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is for our us plans and for our non us plans 
our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis 
a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had approximately the following effect on pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase decrease rate of return on assets discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when we conclude that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain some positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we file income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in  a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if our filing positions are ultimately upheld  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments 
we recognize the benefit of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation all share based payments to employees are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results 

table of contents loss contingencies we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements

the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange transactions lowered gross margin by an estimated points for a portion of this negative impact from foreign exchange transactions was offset through strong manufacturing productivity gains which includes benefits from ssi and strategic price increases 
gross margin included benefits of approximately of reduced obsolescence from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our pls program 
gross margin increased points in as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in inventory obsolescence provisions in  which benefited gross margin by points  and from increased pricing and favorable product mix  which benefited gross margin by points

revenue in venezuela for grew in both constant and us dollars 
revenue in venezuela will be negatively impacted in future periods by the change in the official exchange rate discussed below 

table of contents constant revenue growth in brazil for was primarily driven by an increase in active representatives  as well as a higher average order 
constant revenue growth in mexico for was driven by a significant increase in active representatives  partially offset by a lower average order  reflecting a difficult economic climate 
revenue growth in venezuela for reflected increased prices due to inflation 
the decrease in operating margin in latin america for was primarily due to an estimated point negative impact of unfavorable foreign exchange transactions  which includes the cost of our venezuelan subsidiary settling certain us dollar denominated liabilities through transactions with non government sources where the exchange rate is less favorable than the official rate the parallel market 
additionally  higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives during negatively impacted operating margin by points  as these costs impacted operating margin by points in and points in partially offsetting these negative impacts was the benefit of higher revenues and fixed overhead expense 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products 
unless official foreign exchange is made more readily available  avon venezuela s operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from the parallel market 
during  the exchange rate in the parallel market generally averaged from to bolivars to the us dollar  compared to the official rate of during at december   avon venezuela had cash balances of approximately translated at the december  official rate  of which approximately was denominated in bolivars and was denominated in us dollars 
the last dividends repatriated to the us were during  when avon venezuela remitted dividends of approximately at the official exchange rate 
avon venezuela continues to receive official foreign exchange for some of its imports and other remittances 
in  we continued to use the official rate to translate the financial statements of avon venezuela into us dollars 
during  avon venezuela s revenue and operating profit represented approximately and of avon s consolidated revenue and avon s consolidated operating profit  respectively 
inflation in venezuela has been at high levels over the past few years 
avon uses the blended consumer price index and national consumer price index to determine whether venezuela is a highly inflationary economy 
effective with the beginning of its fiscal year  avon will treat venezuela as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 
when an entity operates in a highly inflationary economy  exchange gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities and deferred income taxes resulting from changes in the exchange rate are recorded in income

table of contents capital resources we maintain a five year   revolving credit and competitive advance facility the credit facility  which expires in january the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime or plus the federal funds rate 
the credit facility has an annual fee of  payable quarterly  based on our current credit ratings 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including a financial covenant which requires our interest coverage ratio determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense to equal or exceed the credit facility also provides for possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of  subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
we also maintain a  commercial paper program 
under this program  we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws  for a cumulative face amount not to exceed  outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment 
the commercial paper program is supported by our credit facility 
outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under this program 
in march  we issued principal amount of notes payable in a public offering 
of the notes bear interest at a per annum coupon rate equal to  payable semi annually  and mature on march   unless redeemed prior to maturity the notes

of the losses are being amortized to interest expense over five years and are being amortized over ten years 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our indentures see note  debt and other financing  to our annual report 
such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 

table of contents interest rate risk our long term  fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the fixed rate on the long term debt to a floating interest rate  to manage our interest rate exposure 
at december   we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor  as compared to at december  our total exposure to floating interest rates was at december   and at december  our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
foreign currency risk we operate globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the euro  japanese yen  mexican peso  philippine peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  turkish lira  ukrainian hryvnia and venezuelan bolivar 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates
