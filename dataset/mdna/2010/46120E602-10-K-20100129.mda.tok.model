we design  manufacture and market da vinci surgical systems  which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery 
we believe that this new generation of surgery  which we call da vinci surgery  is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery open surgery and minimally invasive surgery  or conventional mis 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  or consoles  a patient side cart and a high performance vision system 
the da vinci surgical system translates the surgeon s natural hand movements performed on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system provides the surgeon with intuitive control  
table of contents range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition d vision  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures 
business model 
in our business model  we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  derived from sales of instruments  accessories  and service revenue 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for million to million  depending on configuration  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed 
we generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  typically at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending on the configuration of the underlying system 
since the introduction of the da vinci surgical system in  robotic surgery volume has increased and our established base of da vinci surgical systems has grown 
recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue 
recurring revenue increased from million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in the increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems 
we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to  at december   compared with  at december  and at december  regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
as we make additions to target procedures  we will continue to seek the necessary clearances 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures december transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures in january we began selling the da vinci s surgical system in the united states and europe 
in march we received clearance in the united states to market our system held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non arrested heart procedures 
during first quarter of  we received clearance to market our da vinci si surgical system in the united states and europe 
in november  we received regulatory shonin approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor  and welfare mhlw for our da vinci s system in japan 
with this approval  we are now focusing on meeting 
table of contents various trade and importation requirements necessary for commercialization and to obtain appropriate reimbursement rates for da vinci procedures in japan 
we have a separate independent distribution partner in japan who will be responsible for marketing  selling  and servicing our products in japan 
as of december   we had an installed base of  da vinci surgical systems 
during the year ended december  surgeons using our technology completed approximately  surgical procedures of various types in major hospitals throughout the world 
out of those da vinci procedures performed in  approximately  were da vinci prostatectomy dvp procedures and approximately  were da vinci hysterectomy dvh procedures 
business events and trends economic environment 
during  the world wide economic recession curtailed hospital demand for capital purchases of our da vinci surgical systems 
demand for our da vinci surgical systems improved towards the end of and the total da vinci surgical systems sold in slightly exceeded the total of da vinci si surgical system product launch 
during the second quarter of we launched our newest da vinci model  the da vinci si 
the da vinci si brings to market three significant innovations 
first  our insite imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease of use 
the hd imaging system s increased performance is similar to the move from p to i in commercial television 
we believe that the increased visual performance will continue to increase surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times 
secondly  the da vinci si surgeon s user interface was redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da vinci products and other operating room devices  such as electro surgical units 
the new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort 
we believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training 
the third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeon s console for use during surgery  which will allow new methods of training da vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da vinci surgery 
with the da vinci si  a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da vinci arms during a case 
we believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases 
the da vinci si surgical system was fda approved and ce marked upon launch and is currently available in the united states and europe 
da vinci si systems are available with an option to purchase a second console 
existing da vinci s instruments and most da vinci s accessories are compatible with the da vinci si system 
an upgrade from a da vinci s system to the da vinci si system is available for our current customers 
we will continue to sell  service and support the da vinci s surgical system 
while we will not be selling the standard da vinci surgical system  we will continue to service and support this product line as well 
we offered certain of our customers who purchased da vinci s surgical systems in the first quarter of the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da vinci s surgical systems to da vinci si surgical systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade 
the upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da vinci s camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da vinci si camera or other accessories 
these customers were given until june  to accept our offer 
total revenue in an amount equal to the discount  of approximately million  was deferred in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we recognized million of revenue from offers declined  upgrades completed or accessories delivered 
in the third quarter of  we completed all accepted da vinci si system upgrade offers and recognized the remaining million deferred revenue

operating income increased by to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  operating income included million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock programs 
our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased by million during  including million generated from employee stock programs and million provided by additional working capital  offset by million used to repurchase million shares and million used for capital expenditure and the purchase of intellectual property 
we ended fiscal with  million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
procedure adoption we believe the adoption of da vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure  and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value 
the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes  less surgical trauma  or both 
procedures grew to approximately  procedures performed during the year ended december  the procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da vinci hysterectomy dvh and da vinci prostatectomy dvp  which grew and  to approximately  and  procedures  respectively  in dvp is now the leading treatment choice for localized prostate cancer in the united states 
while total dvh procedures were less than dvp procedures in  dvh was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in  and based on a larger market size  is expected to exceed dvp procedures in other urologic procedures such as  da vinci nephrectomy  da vinci cystectomy  da vinci pyeloplasty  other gynecologic procedures such as da vinci myomectomy  da vinci sacral colpopexy  cardiothoracic procedures such as da vinci mitral valve repair  da vinci revascularization  general surgery procedures such as the da vinci thyroidectomy  da vinci low anterior resection  and da vinci gastric bypass have also contributed to our growth

revenue increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  to  million during the year ended december  total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da vinci surgery 
we believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure 
our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures 
dvh and dvp have been our most successful procedures to date and have been significant sales catalysts 
an increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dvp to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal  continence  and sexual potency 
from through  dvh has been among one of our fastest growing procedures and we expect dvh procedures to exceed dvp procedures in favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology  which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion 
for most patients  a minimally invasive approach using the da vinci surgical system offers reduced pain  less blood loss  shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities 
revenue within the united states accounted for   and of total revenue during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the ability of patients to select their healthcare providers in the united states

procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dvh and dvp being the largest drivers of growth 
utilization per installed system for the year ended december  also increased as compared with the year ended december  instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from to instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined approximately during primarily due to the impact of initial stocking orders 
the amount of revenue related to stocking orders is less impactful as the base of installed systems grows 
in addition  we believe our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase 
we expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in systems revenue increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  primarily due to more system upgrade revenue  higher average selling price asp  and more systems sold
