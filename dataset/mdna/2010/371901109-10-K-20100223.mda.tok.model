table of contents in response to the weakness in the automotive market  the company eliminated its entire contract workforce  which was followed by the elimination of a third shift near the end of the third quarter of in addition  the company offered voluntary layoffs  had a partial plan shutdown the week of the thanksgiving holiday and had extended plant shutdowns over the christmas and new year holidays in response to similar plant shutdowns by its automotive customers 
as automotive production schedules continued to weaken  the company permanently laid off approximately hourly and salaried workers in december  which reduced overhead and operating expenses  bringing them to a level that was more in line with sales production levels in the automotive and fire protection industries 
the salaried workforce reductions reduced overhead and operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis 
approximately half of the reduced expense impacts the company s overhead expenses  and the other half impacts the company s operating expenses  primarily in the engineering  research and development areas 
the company also instituted rolling layoffs within the hourly production workforce throughout the first quarter of as the automotive production environment improved during the second half of  the company added temporary contract workers  some direct hire hourly workers and resumed third shift production during the third quarter of the company continues to monitor customer vehicle production plans closely now that automotive vehicle sales levels are lower than automotive production levels 
oem s may need to adjust their production plans for the lower sales level 
the global governmental vehicle stimulus programs  such as the cash for clunkers program in the united states  did not have a significant direct effect on the company s production levels in  since the smaller vehicles that people were mostly purchasing were those that typically did not contain significant gentex content 
however  there may have been some indirect effect due to the increased showroom traffic that those programs created 
the company currently estimates that top line revenue will increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in based on the current csm forecast for light vehicle production levels and our anticipated product mix 
these estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the regions to which the company ships product  as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix 
uncertainties  including light vehicle production levels  extended automotive plant shutdowns  sales rates in north america  europe and asia  customer inventory management  and the impact of potential automotive customer including their tier suppliers bankruptcies  work stoppages  strikes  supplier part shortages  etc  which could disrupt our shipments to these customers making forecasting difficult 
due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes  it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast  and as a result  the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of at this time 
the company also estimates that engineering  research and development expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to increased variable employee compensation and some hiring 
in addition  the company estimates that selling  general and administrative expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to increased variable employee compensation and foreign exchange rates 
based on the current csm forecast for light vehicle production levels  we currently estimate that smartbeam unit shipments will increase approximately in calendar year  and that rcd mirror unit shipments will increase approximately in calendar year the company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of csm worldwide  and csm s current forecasts for light vehicle production for the first quarter of are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea

critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns  which have not historically been significant 
the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accounts receivable 
the company reviews a monthly aging report of all accounts receivable balances starting with invoices outstanding over sixty days 
in addition  the company monitors information about its customers through a variety of sources including the media  and information obtained through on going interaction between company personnel and the customer 
based on the evaluation of the above information  the company estimates its allowances related to customer receivables on historical credit and collections experience  customers current financial condition and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the allowances 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
investments 
the company s investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
management also considers the type of security  related industry  sector performance  as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may incur future impairments 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc the company utilizes the black scholes model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating a the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  b the volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  c the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and d expected dividends 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations
