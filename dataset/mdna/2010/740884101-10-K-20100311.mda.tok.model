underwriting rules for reinstatement of a simplified issue whole life policy must meet the same risk classification it was at issue  or the policyholder is declined reinstatement 
other life products inforce  but no longer being issued  include universal life  whole life  and term life 
universal life policies  flexible premium and single premium  are interest sensitive products  which typically provide the insured with non participating ie non dividend paying life insurance with a cash value 
current interest is credited to the policy s cash value based primarily upon prevailing interest rates 
in no event  however  will the interest rate credited on the policy s cash value be less than the guaranteed rate specified in the policy 
whole life policies are products that provide the insured with life insurance with a guaranteed cash value 
typically  a fixed premium  which costs more than comparable term coverage when the policyholder is younger  but less than comparable term coverage as the policyholder grows older  is paid over a period of years 
whole life insurance products combine insurance protection with a savings plan that gradually increases over a period of time  which the policyholder may borrow against 
term life policies are products that provide insurance protection if the insured dies during the time period specified in the policy 
no cash value is built up 
term life products provide the maximum benefit for the lowest initial premium outlay

the parameters of these benefits are spelled out in a plan document that is disseminated to employees 
the employer then purchases stop loss coverage to insure it against claims in excess of contractually designated amounts 
the coverage purchased by the employer will typically cover the risk that a claim on an individual employee exceeds a certain level and the risk that the overall claims for the plan less whatever amount is covered under the specific deductible exceeds a given level

marketing and distribution the insurance company is licensed to market insurance products in all states and the district of columbia 
the insurance company distributes its annuity contracts and life insurance policies products through independent general agents of which are located in new york state 
these general agents  in turn  distribute the insurance company s products through their  licensed insurance agents or brokers most of whom also distribute similar products marketed by other insurance companies 
management believes the insurance company offers innovative products and quality service and that its product commission rates are competitive 
the new york state department of insurance nysid regulates general agent commission rates 
the independent general agent system is the insurance company s primary product distribution system 
management believes the insurance company s focus on the general agent distribution system provides cost advantages since the insurance company incurs minimal fixed costs associated with recruiting  training and maintaining agents via their general agents 
therefore  a substantial portion of the costs normally associated with product distribution is variable 
distribution costs rise and fall with the level of business 
the insurance company utilizes many general agents to distribute its products and  therefore  is not dependent on any one general agent or agent for a substantial amount of its business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
generally  the insurance company issues annuity contracts along with the general agent s commission within two business days after application receipt 
the insurance company also provides general agent support by providing direct access to the insurance company s senior executives 
annuity contract and life insurance policyholders may access information regarding their individual holdings via the company s website or toll free telephone number 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of the insurance company s sales in no single general agent accounted for more than and no single agent accounted for more than of total sales 
management believes no single distribution source loss will have a material adverse impact on the insurance company 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales unless these sources are timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  the insurance company continuously recruits new independent general agents 
underwriting procedures the insurance company issues graded benefit life  a guaranteed issue product that requires no underwriting 
the maximum face amount for this product is  the insurance company continues to maintain its life inforce business and this may require additional underwriting ie reinstatements  re entries  and conversions 
in that regard  the insurance company has adopted and follows detailed  uniform underwriting procedures designed to assess and quantify insurance risks 
to the extent that a policyholder eligible for reinstatement  reentry or conversion does not meet the insurance company s underwriting standards at the standard risk classifications  the insurance company may offer to issue a classified  sub standard or impaired risk policy for a risk adjusted premium amount rather than declining the application 
the amount of the insurance company s impaired risk insurance in force in proportion to the tot al amount of the insurance company s individual life insurance in force was approximately at december  in addition to graded benefit life and beginning in april  the company introduced a simplified issue whole life policy for customers who would not qualify for standard risk rates  but want immediate coverage as opposed to graded benefit life  which has a modified face amount for two to three years 
the rates are sub standard based on the impairments that are acceptable by the company for that risk classification 
the maximum face amount available is  and underwriting is required to approve for issue 
field underwriting by the agent is required at the time of the application 
the applicant is required to disclose medical information which is then verified by the company to ascertain if the risk is acceptable or greater than the impairments that qualify for the product 
if the applicant is not eligible by underwriting s tandards we can offer a graded benefit life policy 
underwriting rules for reinstatement of a simplified issue policy must meet the same risk classification it was at issue  or the policyholder is declined reinstatement 
policy claims individual life claims are received and reviewed by claims examiners at the insurance company s home office 
the initial review of claims includes verification that coverage is in force and that the claim is not subject to exclusion under the policy 
birth and death certificates are basic requirements 
medical records and investigative reports are ordered for contestable claims 
reinsurance the insurance company follows the usual industry practice of reinsuring ceding portions of its life insurance and medical stop loss risks with other companies  a practice that permits the insurance company to write policies in amounts larger than the risk it is willing to retain and to obtain commissions on the insurance ceded and thereby reduce its net commission expense 
the maximum amount of individual life insurance normally retained by the insurance company on any one life is  per policy and  per life 
the insurance company cedes primarily on an automatic basis  under which risks are ceded to a reinsurer on specific blocks of business where the underlying risks meet certain predetermined criteria  and on a facultative basis  under which the reinsurer s prior approval is required on each risk reinsured 
the maximum retention of the group medical stop loss business varies  but typically the insurance company cedes to on a quota share basis 
use of reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from liability on the insurance ceded 
an insurer is required to pay the full amount of its insurance obligations regardless of whether it is entitled or able to receive payments from the reinsurer 
at december   of the approximately  million of the company s individual life insurance in force  the insurance company had ceded to reinsurer s approximately million 
the principal reinsurance companies of individual life policies with whom the insurance company did business at december  were transamerica international re  ltd 
not rated by am best and swiss re life and health america  inc am best rating of a excellent 
competition the insurance company operates in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms  and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with the insurance company  many of which are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than the insurance company 
the insurance company believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in the insurance company s target markets 
management believes that the insurance company s ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market its products and to successfully develop competitive  profitable products 
management believes that the insurance company has good relationships with its agents  has an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and generally is competitive within the industry in all applicable areas

limited partnerships the insurance company has been investing in limited partnerships for over twenty years 
during this time  the insurance company has had an opportunity to consider and evaluate a substantial number of limited partnerships and their managers 
the insurance company makes limited partnership investments based on a number of considerations  including the reputation  investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk  performance history and investment strategy of the manager of the limited partnership 
managers of the limited partnerships in which the insurance company is invested include  among others  blackstone investment management  starwood capital  goldman sachs capital partners  apollo real estate and fortress investment group 
the book value of the corporation s investments in limited partnerships as of december   and was approximately million  million and million respectively 
net investment income loss derived from the insurance company s interests in limited partnership investments aggregated approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
these amounts represented  and of the company s total net investment income in such years 
pursuant to the terms of certain limited partnership agreements to which the insurance company is a party  the insurance company is committed to contribute  if called upon  an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to such limited partnerships 
commitments of million will expire in  million in  million in and million in as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over seventy limited partnerships  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including debt restructurings  real estate  international opportunities  merchant banking  oil and gas  infrastructure and multi strategy hedge funds 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which except for hedge fund investments  may be mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to receive quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
the company is invested in six hedge fund limited partnerships with a carrying value of million as of december  these partnerships each contain liquidity provisions which allow the company to withdraw amounts equal to the total capital account balance at least annually with notice requirements of days 
these withdrawals may be subject to a holdback of  with final distributions pending the completion of the partnership s annual audit 
the company has two hedge fund positions with private special investments  which currently range from approximately of its carrying value  which would be excluded from the withdrawal process 
approximately of the company s investment portfolio in limited partnerships is involved in distressed asset investments 
these limited partnerships take positions in debt and equity securities  loans originated by banks and other liabilities of financially troubled companies 
investments in companies undergoing debt restructurings  which by their nature have a high degree of financial uncertainty  may be senior  unsecured or subordinated indebtedness 
this makes such underlying investments particularly sensitive to interest rate increases  which could affect the ability of the borrower to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its fixed charges 
approximately of the company s limited partnership portfolio generally invest in real estate assets  real estate joint ventures and real estate operating companies 
these partnerships seek to achieve significant rates of return by targeting investments that provide a strategic or competitive advantage and are priced at levels that the general partner believes to be attractive 
the limited partnerships that are involved in international investments generally purchase sovereign debt  corporate debt  and or equity in foreign companies that are developing a greater worldwide presence 
general partners who had demonstrated expertise in this area and in the particular country involved operate such limited partnerships 
such investments involve risks related to the particular country including political instability  currency fluctuations  and repatriation restrictions 
the limited partnerships that are involved in merchant banking activities generally seek to achieve significant rates of return including capital gains through a wide variety of investment strategies  including leveraged acquisitions  bridge financing  and other private equity investments in existing businesses 
limited partnership investments are selected through a careful  two stage review process 
the investment analyst staff conducts a due diligence review which includes the offering documents  performance history of each investment manager as well as interviews with existing investors and or market participants 
separately  the investment committee interviews the manager to determine whether the investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk and strategies of the limited partnership are in the best interests of the insurance company 
only after both the investment analyst staff and the investment committee make a positive recommendation does the insurance company invest in a limited partnership 
in addition  the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the corporation or the insurance company  as the case may be 
to evaluate both the carrying value and the continuing appropriateness of the company s investment in any limited partnership  management maintains ongoing discussions with the investment manager and considers the limited partnership s operations  current and near term projected financial condition  earnings capacity and distributions received by the insurance company during the year 
despite the company s historic successful returns  prior to  on its limited partnership investments and their substantial contributions to the company s profits in recent years  the ratings agencies which evaluate the company have an unfavorable view of such investments 
the company believes that this has had a negative effect on the company s ratings see item management s discussion and analysis ratings agencies 
as such  although the limited partnership investments have contributed substantially to the company s profits  they have not enabled the company to achieve the ratings upgrades that might be expected to accompany such profitable performance 
this factor is continually monitored by company s management in determining whether and to what extent the company will continue to invest in limited partnerships at current  reduced or increased levels 
such decisions will be subject to the appr oval of the chief investment officer and the investment committee and the review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company and the corporation  as the case may be 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships that it has received during the foregoing periods or that it will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance company s financial condition and results of operations 
other investments as of december   the company s investment portfolio included approximately million invested in preferred stock  and approximately million invested in common stock 
the company s only direct real estate investments are two buildings in nyack  new york  which are used as the current home office of the insurance company  and two acres of undeveloped land in nyack  new york

insurance regulation general regulation as an insurance holding company  the corporation is subject to regulation by the state of new york  where the insurance company is domiciled  as well as all other states where the insurance company transacts business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and furnish to it financial and other information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
the corporation has registered as a holding company system in new york 
the laws and regulations of new york applicable to insurance holding companies require  among other things  that all transactions within a holding company system be fair and equitable and that charges for services be equitable 
in addition  many transactions require prior notification to or approval of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the superintendent 
prior written approval of the superintendent is required for the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the insurance companies voting securities 
applicable state insurance laws  rather than federal bankruptcy laws  also apply to the liquidation or reorganization of insurance companies 
the insurance company is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory agencies of the states in which it is authorized to transact business 
state insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers 
principal among these powers are granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating marketing and other trade practices  operating guaranty associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating premium rates  regulating insurance holding company systems  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  performing financial  market conduct and other examinations  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  defining acceptable accounting principles  regulating the type  valuation and amount of investments permitted  and limiting the amount of dividends that ca n be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval 
one of the requirements is that the insurance company performs annual cash flow testing of its assets and liabilities 
based on the testing performed  the insurance company held an asset liability reserve of million at year end  million at year end and million at year end  for statutory accounting purposes only  to address the risk of a substantial increase in surrenders in a rising interest rate environment 
the insurance company is required to file detailed periodic reports and financial statements with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which it does business 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurance company s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with the insurance department rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  the new york state insurance department nysid generally conducts detailed examinations of the books  records and accounts of the insurance company every three years 
the most recent examination covered a three year period ending december  the final report was issued on march  the examiner s review did not reveal any differences which materially affected the company s financial condition or deviated from the new york insurance law  department regulatio ns and circular letters or the operating rules of the company 
the nysid will continue to review the pricing methodologies and assumptions of the company s products  in light of new york state s self support regulations  which state that life insurance companies domiciled or conducting business in new york state are prohibited to sell insurance products that are priced with expected loss based on reasonable actuarial assumptions 
statutory reporting practices the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the new york state insurance department 
the new york state insurance department has adopted the provisions of the naic s statutory accounting practices as the basis for its statutory practices 
accounting practices used to prepare statutory financial statements for regulatory filings of stock life insurance companies differ in certain instances from gaap 
the following are the major differences between statutory accounting principles sap and gaap sap  unlike gaap  utilizes asset valuation reserves and interest maintenance reserves  which are intended to stabilize surplus from fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio 
future policy benefits and policyholders account balances under sap differ from gaap due to differences between actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies 
certain policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  sales inducements  and certain expenses related to policy issuance and underwriting are expensed as incurred under sap  but are deferred under gaap and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies or based on past and projected profits to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses 
under gaap  deferred federal income taxes provide for temporary differences  which are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in a different period than for federal income tax purposes 
deferred taxes are also recognized under sap  however  there are limitations as to the amount of deferred tax assets that may be reported as admitted assets 
under sap  the change in the deferred taxes is recorded in surplus  rather than as a component of income tax expense 
for statutory accounting purposes  all of the company s debt securities are recorded at amortized cost  except for securities in or near default  which are reported at fair value 
under gaap  they are carried at amortized cost or fair value based on their classification as either held to maturity or available for sale 
certain assets  such as furniture and equipment  agents debit balances  and prepaid expenses  are not admissible under sap but are recognized under gaap 
under sap  premiums from universal life and deferred annuities are recognized as premium when received 
under gaap  the premiums received are recorded as an increase in liability for policyholder account balances and revenues are recognized primarily when the policy administration fee portion of premiums and surrender charges are received 
regulation of dividends and other payments from the insurance company the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no other business operations  its primary sources of cash needed to meet its obligations  including dividend payments on its common stock  are rent from its real estate  income from its investments and dividends from the insurance company 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under new york law  the insurance company is permitted  without prior insurance regulatory clearance  to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year  or ii its statutory net gain after tax from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
any dividend in excess of such amount is subject to approval by the superintendent 
the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has established informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines focus on  among other things  an insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices  which  as discussed above  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
in  the insurance company paid million in stockholder dividends to the corporation 
in  the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend of million to the corporation without prior regulatory clearance 
however  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in subsequent years 
accordingly  management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have adequate statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements  including the payment of dividends  or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
investment reserves asset valuation reserve statutory accounting practices require a life insurance company to maintain an asset valuation reserve avr to absorb realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on a portion of an insurer s fixed income securities and equity securities 
the avr is required to stabilize statutory surplus from fluctuations in the market value of bonds  stocks  mortgages  real estate  and other long term investments 
the maximum avr is calculated based on the application of various factors that are applied to the assets in the insurer s portfolio 
the avr generally captures credit related realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on such assets 
each year the amount of an insurer s avr will fluctuate as the investment portfolio changes and capital gains and losses are absorbed by the reserve 
to adjust for such changes over time  contributions must be made to the avr in an aggregate amount equal to of the difference between the maximum avr as calculated and the actual avr 
these contributions may result in a slower rate of growth in or a reduction of the insurance company s surplus 
the extent of the impact of the avr on the insurance company s surplus depends in part on the future composition of the insurance company s investment portfolio 
interest maintenance reserve the interest maintenance reserve imr captures capital gains and losses net of taxes on fixed income investments primarily bonds and mortgage loans resulting from interest rate changes  which are amortized into net income over the estimated remaining periods to maturity of the investments sold 
the extent of the impact of the imr depends on the amount of future capital gains and losses on fixed maturity investments resulting from interest rate changes 
naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and primarily is intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies normal ranges for each ratio 
the iris ratios were designed to advise state insurance regulators of significant changes in an insurance company s product mix  large reinsurance transactions  increases or decreases in premiums received and certain other changes in operations 
these changes need not result from any problems with an insurance company  but merely indicate changes in certain ratios outside ranges defined as normal by the naic 
when an insurance company has four or more ratios falling outside normal ranges  state regul ators may  but are not obligated to  inquire of the company regarding the nature of the company s business to determine the reasons for the ratios being outside the normal range 
no regulatory significance results from being out of the normal range on fewer than four of the ratios 
for the year ended december   the insurance company  had four ratios that fell outside the normal range 
two ratios  the net change in capital and surplus and the gross change in capital and surplus fell outside of the normal range due to an increase in unrealized losses as well as an increase in the non admitted portion of the statutory deferred tax asset 
the adequacy of investment income was slightly below normal due to the decrease in investment income  more specifically due to the loss in income on the limited partnerships 
the change in reserve ratio life of the insurance company  fell outside the normal range 
this was primarily attributable to the one time elimination on december  of the additional reserve that had been established on december  on the guaranteed issued business 
as part of our filing requirements  we have provided the naic with explanations regarding the exceptions noted above 
we anticipate being in compliance in risk based capital under the naic s risk based capital rbc formula  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
the standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount  which then is compared to a company s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset default  adverse insurance experience  disintermediation and external events 
this information is intended to permit insurance regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
the naic formula provides for four levels of potential involvement by state regulators for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  ranging from a requirement for an insurance company to submit a plan to improve its capital company action leve l to regulatory control of the insurance company mandatory control level 
at december   the insurance company s company action level was million and the mandatory control level was million 
the insurance company s adjusted capital at december  and was million and million  respectively  which exceeds all four action levels 
the company s rbc ratio as of december  and was and  respectively 
assessments against insurers most applicable jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in guaranty funds  which are designed to indemnify policyholders of insolvent insurance companies 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions generally are subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s insolvency and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the amount of these assessments against the insurance company in and prior years have not been material 
however  the amount and timing of any future assessment against the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the corporation and the insurance company 
as such  no reasonable estimate of such assessments can be made 
regulation at federal level although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and any future federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such congressional activity or the potential effects thereof on the corporation 
regulation at state level the insurance company is subject to regulation by numerous states 
an individual state may subject the insurance company to rules or regulations that will adversely affect the insurance company s operations in other states 
if the individual state s rules or regulations are sufficiently prejudicial  the insurance company may have to abandon that individual state as a market 
environmental considerations as an owner and operator of real property  the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties 
we cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise 
however  based on information currently available to management  we believe that any costs associated with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
enterprise risk management under the current economic environment  the company s enterprise risk management erm program has become more critical in supporting executive decision making regarding capital management  investment decisions  and other key decisions  contributing to preserve and enhance shareholder value 
in  the company adopted an erm policy as a methodology and process for the company to actively manage risks 
management adopts the use of robust capital modeling to help optimize executives key decisions 
management has developed a structured erm framework in order to identify  monitor  and mitigate major risks 
status on key risk management initiatives  as well as risk dashboard reports  is provided to the board of directors quarterly 
the framework also allows the company to clarify corporate governance structure  ensure clear accountabili ty and identify any potential gaps that may emerge in current risk management practices

risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect the corporation s business  financial results and results of operations 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
any or all forward looking statements may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many such factors will be important in determining our actual future results 
these statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment 
they involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
among factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are credit market conditions  may adversely affect the business and the results of operations and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future since mid  the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
beginning in the second half of  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels and the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers 
we maintain a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations  is believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense obligations 
in the event our current internal sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs  we may have to sell our longer term fixed maturities into an environment that could produce significant losses 
the demand for our products could be adversely affected in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower consumer spending  lower corporate earnings and lower business investments 
we also may experience a higher incidence of claims and lapses or surrender of policies 
our policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums 
we cannot predict definitively whether or when such actions  which could impact our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition  may occur 
investment in limited partnerships as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over seventy limited partnerships managed by various general partners  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including real estate  international opportunities  debt restructurings  oil and gas and merchant banking 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
the matters set forth above could have a material adverse impact on these partnerships 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships that it has received during the past periods or that it will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance company s financial condition and results of operations 
heightened competition  including with respect to pricing  entry of new competitors and the development of new products by new and existing competitors the insurance company operates in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms  and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with the insurance company  many of which are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than the insurance company 
the insurance company believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating  and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in the insurance company s target markets 
management believes that the insurance company s ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market its products and its ability to successfully develop competitive  profitable products 
management believes that the insurance company has good relationships with its agents  has an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and generally is competitive within the industry in all applicable areas 
our primary reliance  as a holding company  on sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate to meet operating expenses and dividend payments the corporation is a holding company and  therefore  depends on dividends  distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations 
the insurance company is subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from the insurance company to the corporation 
regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that the corporation needs to make payments on obligations or dividend payments 
an inability of the corporation to access funds from its subsidiaries could adversely affect its ability to meet its obligations 
adverse results from litigation  arbitration or regulatory investigations financial services companies are frequently the targets of litigation  including class action litigation  which could result in substantial judgments 
regulatory  accounting or tax changes that may affect the cost of  or demand for  our products or services the company s insurance business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the united states by both state and federal regulators 
the primary purpose of state regulation of the insurance business is to protect contract owners  and not necessarily to protect other constituencies of the insurance company  such as creditors or shareholders 
state insurance regulators  state attorneys general  the national association of insurance commissioners  the securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers nasd continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and may impose changes in the future 
changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation  financial services regulation  and federal taxation could lessen the advantages of certain of the company s products as compared to competing pr oducts  or possibly result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies or reduced sales of new products and  therefore  could reduce the company s profitability 
the adoption of new laws or regulations  enforcement action or litigation  whether or not involving the company  could influence the manner in which it distributes its insurance products  which could adversely impact the company 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
downgrades in our claims paying ability  financial strength or credit ratings ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
a downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  of any of the ratings for the company could  among other things materially increase the number of annuity contract surrenders and withdrawals  result in the termination of relationships with broker dealers  banks  agents  wholesalers  and other distributors of the company s products and services  and reduce new sales of annuity contracts or increase the minimum interest rate the company may be required to pay under new annuity contracts 
any of these consequences could adversely affect the company s profitability and financial condition 
changes in rating agency policies or practices rating organizations assign ratings based upon numerous factors 
while most of the factors relate to the rated company  some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization  general economic conditions  and circumstances outside the rated company s control 
in addition  rating organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess financial strength of a rated company  and from time to time rating organizations have  in their discretion  altered the models 
changes to the models  general economic conditions  or circumstances outside the company s control could impact a rating organization s judgment and the subsequent rating it assigns the company 
the company cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take  or what actions it may be required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations  which could adversely affect the company 
reliance on general agents the independent general agent system is the insurance company s primary product distribution system 
the insurance company utilizes many general agents to distribute its products and therefore  is not dependent on any one general agent or agent for a substantial amount of its business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of the insurance company s sales in no single gene ral agent accounted for more than and no single agent accounted for more than of total sales 
management believes no single distribution source loss will have a material adverse impact on the insurance company 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales and could have an adverse material impact on the insurance company unless these sources are timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  the insurance company continuously recruits new independent general agents 
a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure could impair our liquidity  disrupt our businesses  damage our reputation and cause losses shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
for example  our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions 
the transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
our financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that support s our businesses or the community in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations  which could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subjec t to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense 
in addition  competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals has been intense 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees  an inability to do so may impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or remediate inefficiencies 
discrepancies between actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for our obligations for future policy benefits and claims the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life insurance policies  accident and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
while the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions  there c an be no guarantee that future estimates and assumptions will not significantly deviate from actual results 
our business may be adversely affected if the decline in annuity contracts in force were to continue for an extended period of time the declining trend in annuity inforce primarily reflects unusually large volumes of business written in thru these contracts started to come off surrender charge at the end of  through the end of  at a relatively large expected surrender rate 
in  annuity surrenders and death claims outpaced new sales causing a slight decline in total annuity inforce 
the company believes that surrenders and death claim activity combined with the challenging low interest rate environment for annuity sales  total annuities inforce may fall 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of herbert kurz  our former chairman in december  our former chairman  herbert kurz  commenced a solicitation of stockholder consents for the purpose of  among other things  removing from office  without cause  all of the current directors other than mr 
kurz himself and electing in their place a slate of nominees proposed by mr 
kurz  who would  in turn  re install mr 
kurz as interim ceo 
mr 
kurz did not obtain the requisite stockholder consents to his proposals within the time frame prescribed by delaware law 
nevertheless  on february   mr 
kurz notified the company of his intention to nominate  for election at the next annual shareholders meeting  the same slate of nominees that he had proposed in his unsuccessful consent solicitation 
mr 
kurz further indicated that he may initiate a proxy contest in connection with those nominations 
if mr 
kurz or any other shareholder d oes wage a proxy contest  our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders will be costly and time consuming  disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees  which may negatively impact our financial results  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners  if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders  and if mr 
kurz is successful in electing his hand picked slate of nominees  those nominees have indicated previously that they intend to reinstall mr 
kurz who will then be years old as interim ceo of the company 
reinstalling mr 
kurz as ceo could negatively impact the company in several respects 
the company will face the risk of downgrading by rating agencies  in particular am best 
am best has placed the company under review with negative implications as a result of the management uncertainty engendered by mr 
kurz s control campaign 
a downgrade by am best could have a negative impact on the insurance company s ability to sell its products 
in addition  the new york state insurance department  which has regulatory authority over the company s business  is investigating the kurz family foundation and mr 
kurz 
if mr 
kurz is reinstalled as ceo and regulatory action is taken against him as a result of that investigation  the company could be adversely affected 
all of these actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility  item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties the corporation owns  and the insurance company leases and is the sole occupant of  two adjacent office buildings located at lydecker street and north broadway in nyack  new york 
these buildings contain an aggregate of approximately  square feet of usable office space 
the insurance company also owns two acres of unimproved land in nyack  new york 
management believes that the corporation s present facilities are adequate for its anticipated needs 
item legal proceedings on december   an alleged stockholder plaintiff  alan r 
kahn the plaintiff  filed a derivative action the kahn action  for the purported benefit of the company  against mr 
kurz and the company s other directors  and the company itself as a nominal defendant 
plaintiff alleges that mr 
kurz and the other directors breached their fiduciary duties and wasted the company s assets by authorizing the continued payment of compensation and fringe benefits to mr 
kurz after he resigned as president of the company and ceo of the insurance company  and in view of mr 
kurz s failure to disclose that  as he later represented in the tax return for the kurz family foundation the foundation  he allegedly spent hours a week working as a director of the foundation  that mr 
kurz pledged his support for donald barnes around and before the time of the annual stockholders meeting in may  but then  in statements filed in october and november  disclosed that he was commencing a consent solicitation to remove  without cause  mr 
barnes and the other directors except for himself  that in or around december  the directors other than mr 
kurz disclosed  allegedly belatedly  that they did not believe that mr 
kurz  at his advanced age of nearly  could effectively serve in a management capacity for a public company  that an independent committee of the board had uncovered a pattern of self dealing by mr 
kurz that included  among other things  misuse of the company s health insurance plan and kurz s use of charitable assets  of the foundation  for non charitable purposes  and that the new york state insurance department has instituted an official investigation into the affairs  conduct and practices of the foundation 
in addition to the fiduciary and waste claims asserted against the directors  plaintiff also brought a claim for unjust enrichment against mr 
kurz alone  demanding that he disgorge all purported unearned compensation 
plaintiff also demands that the directors account to the company for all damages and return all remuneration paid to them while they were allegedly in breach of their duties 
plaintiff also seeks to enjoin the company from continuing to pay compensation and benefits to mr 
kurz  as well as attorneys fees and other relief that the court may deem proper 
the company and the directors other than mr 
kurz have filed motions to dismiss based on failure to state a claim and failure to make a demand on the board 
management does not believe that this action will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

sales are being made with a greater selectivity based on increased profit level requirements for new business 
the insurance company has determined that the level of competition in the sale of traditional and universal life insurance products has made it very difficult for smaller insurance companies  such as the insurance company  to participate in this business in a profitable way 
accordingly  the insurance company has determined that  under the current market conditions  it will not participate in the sale of traditional and universal life policies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the insurance company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with three primary lines of business individual annuities  individual life insurance  and group accident and health 
revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts  life and accident and health products  and gains or losses from our investment portfolio 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingent annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
for these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the insurance company s individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health depends largely on the size of its inforce book of business  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claim and expense management 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
when we use the term we  us and our we mean the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below under certain factors that may affect our business and under risk factors see ite m a 
executive overview results the corporation s earnings per share were for  as compared to in and in results in primarily reflect a decrease in investment income 
our total revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in net income in was million as compared to million in and million in benefits and expenses in were million  compared to million in and million in the corporation s decreases in earnings and revenues in resulted primarily from decreases in net investment income 
decreased investment income from the corporation s short term investments and fixed maturities as well as investment losses from the limited partnerships all contributed to lower revenues in as shown in the table below  due to the global economic recession that took hold in  the company s net income began to decrease each quarter following the first quarter of in fact  the company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of and continued to report losses through the second quarter of as the economic climate began to improve in the second half of  the company was able to post net income of thousand and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
if the economy continues to strengthen in  the company s earnings should continue to improve although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
three months ended net loss income march june september december in thousands certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risk 
a summary of these factors is set below market conditions the corporation  like all companies  is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
the pressures related to the current recessionary environment coupled with the distortion of the capital markets have resulted in one of the most difficult business environments in years and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk has never been more challenging 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on how we deal with the regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk business is dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any internal failures in the internal processes  people  or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the corporation 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk one of the insurance company s principal products is deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates the insurance company s annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity to seek alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
as of december   the existence of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect  primarily for up to the first years of each annuity policy and  therefore  disappear over time see table below 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  the insurance company may have to sell off longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
the insurance company continually develops strategies to address the match between the timing of its assets and liabilities 
to that end  in  and  a significant number of policies came off surrender charge and a significant portion of this business did surrender 
this can be seen in the surrender ratio in the table on page the company anticipated this and maintained a significant level of cash equivalents to fund surrenders avoiding the need to sell long term assets at a loss 
the company believes that the heavy surrender activity is now largely behind us 
additionally  management has increased the incentive for agents to retain this business with the company by paying full first year compensation on internal rollovers 
since  a significantly smaller amount of business has been coming off surrender charge  as shown in the table below 
consequently  we expect a continuation of the markedly lower surrender ratio in the next twelve months  when compared to those in prior years 
account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that the insurance company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders can either surrender policies or cause their policies to lapse by failing to pay premiums 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the insurance company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes the insurance company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment losses gains average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets including accrued investment income minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
the company experienced a decline in net investment income of million from million in to million in a significant part of this decline was due to income from the limited partnerships 
due to schedule k adjustments caused by the extraordinary decline in the financial markets in  which were realized in net investment income in  income from the limited partnerships had a decline of million in limited partnership income declined from a gain of million in to a loss of million in the insurance company experienced a decline of million of investment income from short term investments caused by the abnormally low commercial paper rates throughout income from bonds also declined million from million in to million in  due to a decline in both invested assets and invested yields compared to investments the insurance company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the insurance company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the insurance company are governed by the statement of investment policy established and approved by the finance and investment committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and the corporation and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the finance and investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the finance and investment committees are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company and corporation 
the insurance company s statement of investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable r egulatory bodies 
the insurance company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the insurance company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the insurance company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the insurance company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the insurance company s investment policies to reflect changes in the insurance company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the insurance company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the insurance company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
when assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security or if it is more likely that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its cost basis  we evaluate facts and circumstances such as  but not limited to  decisions to reposition our security portfolio and sale of securities to meet cash flow needs 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a fixed maturity security  we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover 
the discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying fixed maturity security 
the effective interest rate is the original yield or the coupon if the fixed maturity security was previously impaired 
if an other than temporary impairment otti exists and we have the intent to sell the security  we conclude that the entire otti is credit related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income 
if we do not intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security referred to as the credit loss  we conclude that an otti has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income  as this is also deemed the credit portion of the otti 
the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to other comprehensive income oci  as an unrealized otti loss on our consolidated balance sheets  as this is considered a noncredit ie  recoverable impairment 
to determine the recovery period of a fixed maturity security  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including  but not limited to  the following historic and implied volatility of the security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area  failure  if any  of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments  and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
for all fixed maturities securities evaluated for otti  we consider the timing and amount of the cash flows 
when evaluating whether our collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are other than temporarily impaired  we also examine the characteristics of the underlying collateral  such as delinquency  loss severities and default rates  the quality of the underlying borrower  the type of collateral in the pool  the vintage year of the collateral  subordination levels within the structure of the collateral pool  the quality of any credit guarantors  the susceptibility to variability of prepayments  our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in assessing corporate fixed maturities securities for otti  we evaluate the ability of the issuer to meet its debt obligations and the value of the company or specific collateral securing th e debt position including the fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is trading  fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates  expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates  and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
for an equity security  if we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value  we conclude that an otti has occurred  and the cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value  with a corresponding change to realized gain loss in our consolidated statements of income 
we base our review on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the cause of the decline  the length of time we have held the equity security  any third party research reports or analysis  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical location 
as of december   of the company s invested assets approximately million consisted of short term commercial paper with maturities of less than days 
this commercial paper consisted of direct obligations of various corporations rated a minimum of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s 
as part of its asset liability management strategy  the insurance company has kept elevated levels of cash investments since  anticipating the potential surrender of annuity contracts with expiring surrender charges 
this cash has been available to meet actual surrenders and any other cash needs 
by having the liquidity afforded by these cash investments during  the company was been able to satisfy all of its cash needs  except for the company s retirement of the senior notes  without any portfolio sales from the fixed income portfolio 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other long term investments 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the insurance company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
commitments of million will expire in  million in  in  and in the insurance company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity sec urities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the current recessionary environment coupled with limited credit availability will challenge the partnerships ability to monetize investments and generate capital gains until conditions improve 
the primary market risks in the insurance company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk discussed above  credit risk and  to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
changes in credit risk are generally measured by changes in corporate yields in relation to the underlying treasuries corporate spreads as well as changes in the credit default swap cds market  although the company is a cash investor and does not buy or sell credit default swaps 
the insurance company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant 
the insurance company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the corporation s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the insurance company could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin 
see interest rate risk  above 
unrealized losses general the following table presents the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and common stock where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost at december  less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses description of securities in thousands us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies corporate bonds preferred stocks subtotal fixed maturities common stock total the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by december  gross unrealized losses of total in thousands less than twelve months twelve months or more total as of december   the company had securities in a net unrealized loss position 
of this total  are bonds holdings  represent preferred stocks and is an equity position 
total unrealized losses decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease in the unrealized losses resulted from the significant tightening in corporate bond spreads caused by the improvement in the financial markets in and the strong recovery in corporate financing  particularly in investment grade corporate bond financing 
according to the bank of america merrill lynch corporate spread indices  year  bbb rated industrial spreads tightened by basis points  bbb rated financial spreads tightened by basis points and bbb rated utility spreads tightened by basis points during the company carefully examines each issue where the market value has fallen below of book value to determine if the bonds are not other than temporarily impaired

us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us agencies the net unrealized loss was  on a fair value of  on the us treasuries 
corporate bonds the predominant investment category for the company s investments is the corporate bond category including public utilities and taxable municipal bonds  which totaled billion at december  municipal bonds had a greater than month loss of million on a fair value of million 
approximately million of this loss represented a bond position in the westchester county ny industrial development agency ida  series this position is secured by a pledge of the rental payments from a story parking garage to the westchester county ida 
there is also additional security provided by a leasehold mortgage on this property and a one year debt service reserve fund 
this bond had also been wrapped by bond insurance provided by aca  a bond insurer that went bankrupt at the end of the bonds are current on principal and interest payments from the cash flow provided by the gara ge and are rated naic investment grade by the svo office of the naic 
the unrealized losses on corporate bonds decreased from million at december  to million at december  the largest loss positions consisted of the following holdings western and southern financial million  principal mutual life insurance company million  first tennessee capital trust million  american general institutional capital trust ii million and nationwide mutual insurance company million

preferred stocks at december   preferred stock losses of duration longer than months totaled million on a cost basis of million 
four of the positions represent holdings of preference shares in the royal bank of scotland which continue to pay dividends 
although non cumulative  royal bank of scotland has asserted that it has a contractual obligation to continue to pay these dividends under the indenture of each issue or risk a default of an associated bond issue 
it has asserted that it will continue to pay these dividends unless prohibited by its financial regulators 
the royal bank preference shares represent a combined loss of approximately million on a cost basis of million

totaling  statutory information the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the new york state insurance department 
prescribed sap include state laws  regulations and general administrative rules  as well as a variety of publications from the naic 
accounting principles used to prepare statutory financial statements differ from financial statements prepared on the basis of gaap 
see item  business  insurance regulation  statutory reporting practices a reconciliation of the insurance company s net income as filed with regulatory authorities to net income reported in the accompanying financial statements for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table in thousands statutory net income reconciling items deferred policy acquisition benefit costs investment income difference gaap deferred taxes policy liabilities and accruals imr amortization imr capital gains payor swaptions federal income taxes other non insurance company s net income gaap net income a reconciliation of the insurance company s shareholders equity as filed with regulatory authorities to shareholders equity reported in the accompanying financial statements as of december is set forth in the following table in thousands statutory shareholders equity reconciling items asset valuation and interest maintenance reserves investment valuation differences deferred policy acquisition costs policy liabilities and accruals difference between statutory and gaap deferred taxes other non insurance company s shareholders equity gaap shareholders equity agency ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the corporation s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted 
in december  am best company reaffirmed the insurance company s rating at b good and placed the company under review with negative implications 
according to a 
m best  the rating actions primarily reflect the lack of clarity regarding the company s future management structure and the future strategic direction of the company 
the company s ratings will remain under review while am best conducts further discussions with management and gains a better understanding of the future make up of the management team and any changes in strategic direction 
in addition  am best will continue to monitor the financial performance of the company 
at the time of the b rating  publications of am best indicated that the b rating was assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
the b rating is within a 
m best s secure classification  along with a  a  a  a  and b ratings 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
in february  the company repaid its corporate debt in full 
the senior notes had been rated by standard and poor s s p and moody s at the time of repayment at b positive and b positive  respectively 
in consideration of this repayment the company decided that it was no longer necessary to retain the rating services and ongoing credit surveillance by s p and moody s

results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year a 
revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately and increased from approximately million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
life insurance premiums were million  million and million in  and respectively 
annuity considerations increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately million  and increased from approximately million in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
these amounts do not include consideration from the sales of deferred annuities or immediate annuities without life contingencies 
under gaap  such sales are reported as additions to policyholder account balances 
consideration from such sales was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  annuity sales grew by over million as a direct result of several factors 
fixed interest rates were fairly attractive most of the year  following a difficult year in the market for most investors 
in february  the company paid off its outstanding long term bond debt 
the independent agent marketplace interpreted this as a strong showing of the financial strength of the company 
the company took advantage of the situation at hand and hired new sales staff to recruit distribution in relatively untapped states 
all of the sales team focused on new general agent distribution and a major focus was placed on our immediate annuity product line 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in this represents a decrease comparing to and an decrease comparing to the decrease in was largely due to the following losses on our limited partnership portfolio and lower returns on the short term commercial paper portfolio 
income loss from limited partnerships amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income from the limited partnerships in is largely reflective of the global economic recession and the inherent volatility in this portfolio 
see item  management s discussion and analysis  asset liability management 
income from short term investments amounted to approximately 
million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in income from short term investments was due to lower short term interest rates in as compared to previous years 
the insurance company s ratios of net investment income to average cash and invested assets  at amortized cost  for the years ended december   and were approximately  and respectively 
without taking into account the returns on its limited partnership investments in those years  the respective ratios would have been  and

net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment losses gains  pre tax  amounted to million in  million in and million in with improving market conditions in  the company experienced a reduction in impairment charges associated to the fixed maturity portfolio when compared to other than temporary impairments charges amounted to million  million and thousand in  and  respectively 
when impairments are determined to be other than temporary  the company adjusts the book value to reflect the fair value  as appropriate  on a quarterly basis and the amount of the impairments are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
realized investment gains losses also result from the sale of certain equity and convertible securities and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investment portfolio 
also  the change in the fair value of th e derivative instruments  even if the investments continue to be held by the company  is reflected in the income statement as a realized gain or loss

benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits paid to policyholders amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these represent an increase of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease comparing fiscal to fiscal in  the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances was greater than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets based on book value for the same period as noted above under net investment income 
in and  the average credited rate was less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets based on book value 
there can be no assurance that the company s ratio of net investment income to book value mean assets the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general  and the company  in particular  the company may  from time to time  change the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce such rates or that any such reductions will broaden the spread 
the company has performed an updated loss recognition test to re confirm the recoverability of dac  with best estimate actuarial assumptions 
the actual spread  excluding capital gains  for the months ended december   and was  and  respectively 
in comparing year end to year end and to year end  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net investment income  as discussed above 
as shown in the table below  the spread on a quarterly basis began to improve in the last three quarters of this improvement is reflective of the strengthening global economy 
if the economy continues to improve in  the spread could continue to increase although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
three months ended march june september december rate on investments credited rate spread rate on investments credited rate spread interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the corporation s notes payable amounted to approximately million in  approximately million in and approximately million in the decrease in was due to the repayment of corporation s senior note in february of the decrease in was primarily due to the repayment of the million line of credit in july of and the corporation s partial repurchase and retirement of its senior notes in and general expenses and taxes  commissions  costs related to consent revocation solicitation general expenses  taxes  commissions to agents and costs related to consent revocation solicitation totaled million in as compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of comparing to and a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase in was primarily due to increased corporate and legal expenses in connection with herbert kurz s commencement of a consent solicitation of approximately million 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower first year commissions and lower commissions paid on internal rollovers in an effort to keep policies in force 
change in deferred policy acquisition costs dac the change in the net dac for resulted in a benefit of approximately million  as compared to a charge of approximately million and a charge of approximately million for and  respectively 
changes in dac consist of three elements deferred costs associated with product sales  amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business and amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business 
deferred costs consisted of credits of million  million and million for  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business consisted of charges of million  million and million in  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business consisted of charges of million in  million in and million in under applicable accounting rules  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
the lower levels of amortization in and relates primarily to the occurrence of net capital losses in and compared to net capital gains in see also the discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under critical accounting policies below

income loss before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in d 
income taxes income tax benefits of approximately million and million were generated in and  respectively  as compared to an expense of approximately million in the benefit in was due to a net loss attributable to lower net income 
the benefit in was primarily attributable to a lower net income and a deferred tax benefit realized on other than temporary impairments incurred on the corporation s investment portfolio 
higher income in generated higher income taxes 
e 
net income for the reasons discussed above  the corporation had net income of approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in liquidity and capital resources general the corporation is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are operating expenses and dividend payments 
the corporation s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the corporation s investments  rent from its real estate and dividends from the insurance company 
in  the corporation s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to 
per share from 
per share in in  the board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend by to 
per share as a prudent measure to preserve capital 
during and  the corporation did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the corporation was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the corporation without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year after tax  excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will only be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent a nd the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
the insurance company paid million  million and million in dividends to the corporation in fiscal  and  respectively 
in  the insurance company would be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend of million to the corporation without prior regulatory clearance 
on a going forward basis  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will have sufficient statutory earnings to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the corporation was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in and the foreseeable future 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
the insurance company s inability to upstream a dividend could have an adverse material impact on the corporation 
with no debt on the balance sheet  currently the corporation biggest cash outlay is to the shareholders in the form of cash dividends  which at the current level of 
per share annually  would total approximately million per year 
the insurance company s current capital and surplus level does not trigger an urgent need for capital raising at the corporation 
however  there are reasons to explore capital raising options including  but not limited to  the following positive impact on credit rating agencies analysis  increasing new business capacity and market share  opportunities for future possible mergers and or acquisitions  increasing financial flexibility  additional restrictions by the nysid on dividends that could be up streamed from the insurance company 
raising capital under the current financial environment will be challenging and expensive 
several options are available including  but not limited to  the following  bank lines of credit loans  sale of home office property  common stock offering  trust preferred stock offering  issue convertible preferred stock 
if the insurance company does not have the financial flexibility to upstream a dividend to the corporation and the corporation is restricted in its ability to raise capital  the board of directors may decide to reduce or suspend the payment of dividends to shareholders until capital conditions improve 
under gaap  net cash provided by the corporation s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by the corporation s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased  called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for purposes of the corporation s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the corporation to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash used in the company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to changes in policyholder account balances as a result of surrenders  sales and interest earned by the policyholders 
the repayment of the corporate debt was also a primarily use of cash in and market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
annuitants may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and were surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
conversely  a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates of basis points would produce a gain in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent focus of the insurance company s management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of its invested assets and the duration of its contractual liabilities to its annuity holders and credit suppliers 
towards this end  at least quarterly  the investment department of the company determines the duration of the company s invested assets in coordination with the company s actuaries  who are responsible for calculating the liability duration 
in the event it is determined that the duration gap between its assets and liabilities exceeds target levels  the company may re position its assets through the sale of invested assets or the purchase of new investments 
another element of the asset liability management strategy is to hedge against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as a payor swaption 
the effect of this transaction would be to lessen the negative impact on the insurance company of a significant increase in interest rates 
with payor swaptions  the company should be able to maintain more competitive crediting rates to policyholders when interest rates rise 
the company has established international swaps and derivatives association isda credit support agreements with six counterparties 
the counterparties are major money center banks that carry credit ratings equal to or higher than aa by moody s and a by s p 
the isda credit support agreement requires counterparties to post collateral in the event that the bank credit rating falls below a by moody s and a by s p 
and the company currently has one contract which expires in june the company has determined that the payor swaptions represent a non qualified hedge 
the market value of the payor swaption as of december  was  a variety of factors affect the value of the payor swaptions 
these include overall treasury interest rate levels  swap spreads  overall market volatility and the length of time remaining before the expiration of a payor swaption 
these investments are classified on the balance s heet as derivative instruments 
the value of the payor swaptions is recognized at fair value market value  with any resulting change in fair value reflected in the statement of income as a realized loss or gain 
the change in market value during was a loss of  the company has determined that the average fair value for the year was the insurance company is continually assessing its swaption portfolio to determine if sufficient protection is provided to cover projected realized losses in the event of a liquidation of assets to satisfy annuity surrenders under a basis points increase in interest rates 
as part of this process  the insurance company may consider purchasing additional swaptions as well as extending the maturity of its swaption portfolio 
future consideration of these transactions or other asset liability management strategies is dependent upon periodic testing based on updated asset and liability data 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the corporation s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

of the total payment of  million   million  or  is from the company s deferred annuity  life  and accident and health business 
determining the timing of these payments involves significant uncertainties  including mortality  morbidity  persistency  investment returns  and the timing of policyholder surrender 
notwithstanding these uncertainties  the table reflects an estimate of the timing of such payments 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the insurance company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the insurance company s fixed maturity portfolio would be expected to decrease  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the insurance company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the insurance company s cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the monetization of the payor swaption investments described a bove and the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the insurance company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
conversely  in an increasing interest rate environment  the cost of funds would be expected to increase  reflecting higher interest crediting rates 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the insurance company s investments that are designated as available for sale in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the insurance company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the insurance company s products until the insurance company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the insurance company s customers 
in that regard  in the current inte rest rate environment  the insurance company has attempted to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  item n  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the new accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on the results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the corporation s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the insurance company s business operations 
investments the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
when assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security or if it is more likely that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its cost basis  we evaluate facts and circumstances such as  but not limited to  decisions to reposition our security portf olio and sale of securities to meet cash flow needs 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a fixed maturity security  we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover 
the discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying fixed maturity security 
the effective interest rate is the original yield or the coupon if the fixed maturity security was previously impaired 
if an otti exists and we have the intent to sell the security  we conclude that the entire otti is credit related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income 
if we do not intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cos t basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security referred to as the credit loss  we conclude that an otti has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income  as this is also deemed the credit portion of the otti 
the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to oci  as an unrealized otti loss on our consolidated balance sheets  as this is considered a noncredit ie  recoverable impairment 
to determine the recovery period of a fixed maturity security  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including  but not limited to  the following historic and implied volatility of the security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area  failure  if any  of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments  and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
for all fixed maturities securities evaluated for otti  we consider the timing and amount of the cash flows 
when evaluating whether our collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are other than temporarily impaired  we also examine the characteristics of the underlying collateral  such as delinquency  loss severities and default rates  the quality of the underlying borrower  the type of collateral in the pool  the vintage year of the collateral  subordination levels within the structure of the collateral pool  the quality of any credit guarantors  the susceptibility to variability of prepayments  our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in assessing corporate fixed maturities securities for otti  we evaluate the ability of the issuer to meet its debt obligations and the value of the company or specific collateral securing th e debt position including the fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is trading  fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates  expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates  and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
for an equity security  if we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value  we conclude that an otti has occurred  and the cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value  with a corresponding change to realized gain loss in our consolidated statements of income 
we base our review on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the cause of the decline  the length of time we have held the equity security  any third party research reports or analysis  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical location 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited partnership interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest  or more than a minor influence over the joint ventures and partnership s operations  but does not have a controlling interest and is not the primary beneficiary 
the company routinely evaluates its limited partnership investments for impairments 
the company considers financial and other information provided by the investee and other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments in determining whether an impairment has occurred 
when an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred  the company records a realized capital loss within net investment income to record the investment at its fair value 
investment income from limited partnerships is recorded based on the company s share of earnings reported in the partnership s most recent audit ed financial statements and income distributed by the partnerships 
management considers the quarterly financial information received from the limited partnerships to be unreliable or insufficient to record investment income  other than from distributions  on a quarterly basis 
management estimates the classification of cash distributions received between investment income and return of capital based on correspondence from the respective partnerships 
the company adjusts its estimate of investment income recorded during the year to the actual realized gains and other income reported in the limited partnerships most recent annual audited financial statements  which are generally received in the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  there may be up to a one year reporting lag for recording investment income that is not distributed during the year  which may result in significant adjustments 
the company records its share of net unrealized gains and losses net of taxes from the audited financial statements of the limited partnerships 
as a result  there may be up to a one year reporting lag for reporting unrealized gains and losses  which may result in significant adjustments to other comprehensive income 
because it is not practicable to obtain an independent valuation for each limited partnership interest  for purposes of disclosure the market value of a limited partnership interest is estimated at book value based on the most recent available audited financial statements 
due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations  the company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments in the amount disclosed in level the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operat ions 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
under applicable accounting rules  these costs  which vary  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
to demonstrate the sensitivity of our net dac balance million as of december  relative to our future spreads and expenses  the information below indicates how much the net dac balance would have changed if the future spread assumption decreased by and if the future expense assumption increased by 
we believe that any variation in our expense or spread estimate is likely to fall within these ranges 
change in assumption decrease in net dac asset future spread decreases million future expenses increase million each year the company conducts testing to confirm that the dac asset is recoverable and that no premium deficiency reserves are deemed necessary 
future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
for policies and contracts where the reserve is reported as the account balance  million  a change in expected experience would have no effect on the reserve 
for those annuities and supplementary contracts with life contingencies that comprise a portion of future policy benefits million of reserves  an increase in mortality experience of per year for individual contracts would increase the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
conversely  a decrease in mortality experience of per year would decrease the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
we believe that any variation of our mortality estimates is likely to fall within this range 
for traditional life insurance business million of reserves  establishing reserves requires the use of many assumptions 
due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of these reserves  and because this business is not material to the overall company results  it is not practical to perform a quantitative analysis on the impact of changes in underlying assumptions 
however  the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions and believes that its assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with gaap 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under fasb codification topic asc 
accordingly  we use the asset and liability method to record deferred income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized that reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  using enacted tax rates 
such temporary differences are primarily due to tax basis of reserves for future policy benefits  deferred acquisition costs  and net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
uncertain tax liabilities we have open tax years in the united states that are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authorities  and certain later tax years that may in the future be subject to examination 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of our uncertain tax liabilities and tax reserves  taking into account our open tax return positions  tax assessments received and tax law changes 
the process of evaluating uncertain tax liabilities and tax reserves involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
the final determination of tax audits could affect our tax reserves
