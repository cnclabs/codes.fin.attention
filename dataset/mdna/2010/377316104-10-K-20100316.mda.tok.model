introduction we manufacture  both domestically and internationally  a wide array of specialty papers and engineered products 
substantially all of our revenue is earned from the sale of our products to customers in numerous markets  including book publishing  envelope converting  carbonless papers and forms  food beverage filter papers  decorative laminates for furniture and flooring  metallized papers and other highly technical niche markets 
overview our results of operations for when compared with were impacted by the weak global economic conditions 
overall volumes shipped by specialty papers declined slightly and composite fibers declined in the year to year comparison 
as a result of the soft demand for most of our products and our efforts to reduce inventory  during the second quarter of  we incurred significant market related downtime at many of our facilities which adversely affected results of operations 
this downtime continued within our composite fibers business unit into the third quarter  although to a lesser extent 
for  we generated million of cash from operations  including alternative fuel mixture credits  as a result of improved operations  inventory reductions and effective working capital management initiatives 
during  we registered two of our facilities with the us internal revenue service as alternative fuel mixers based on their use of black liquor as an glatfelter annual report 
table of contents alternative fuel source 
our results of operations included  on a pre tax basis  million of alternative fuel mixture credits  of which million was received in cash and another million was used to offset interim estimated tax payments 
we expect to realize the remaining million of credits in the form of non taxable refundable income tax credits 
specialty papers operating income totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the improvement in operating income was led by productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives and sales of renewable energy credits  partially offset by the adverse impact of lower volumes and selling prices 
during  the weak economic environment adversely affected demand in all markets served by specialty papers 
as a result of weak demand in the first half of the year and our efforts to reduce inventory  this unit incurred market related downtime totaling  tons of paper 
during the year  we reduced specialty papers inventories by 
our composite fibers business unit s operating income declined to million from million in volumes shipped during declined compared to as a result of the weak economic environment and our customers actions to reduce their inventory levels 
as a result of weak demand and our inventory reduction efforts  during we incurred unscheduled downtime totaling approximately  tons of paper  or of the unit s total capacity for the period 
in addition  our pre tax results of operations in included million of lower gains from the sale of timberlands than what was realized in we also recorded million of pension expense in compared with pension income of million in results of operations versus the following table sets forth summarized results of operations year ended december in thousands  except per share net sales gross profit operating income net income earnings per diluted share the consolidated results of operations for and include the following items not considered to be part of our core business operations after tax in thousands  except per share income loss diluted eps alternative fuel mixture credits acquisition related costs gains on sale of timberlands reversal of shutdown and restructuring charges acquisition integration costs these items increased earnings by million  or per diluted share in comparatively  the items identified above increased earnings in by million  or per diluted share 
business units results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
the costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in other and unallocated in the business unit performance table 
management evaluates results of operations of the business units before pension income or expense  alternative fuel mixture credits  charges related to the fox river environmental reserves  restructuring related charges  unusual items  certain corporate level costs  and the effects of asset dispositions 
management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core papermaking businesses  the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations 
such amounts are presented under the caption other and unallocated 
this presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company 
it is also on this basis that our performance is evaluated internally and by our board of directors

operating income increased million in the year over year comparison and totaled million in the improvement in operating income was primarily due to million of productivity efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives and million of lower input costs 
these favorable factors were offset by million of lower volumes and mix impact and million of lower selling prices 
operating income was also adversely impacted by the costs of unplanned downtime at the spring grove and chillicothe facilities totaling approximately million in compared to we sell excess power generated by the spring grove  pa facility pursuant to a long term contract that expires march  the following table summarizes this activity for each of the past two years in thousands change energy sales costs to produce net renewable energy credits total renewable energy credits recs represent sales of certified credits earned related to burning renewable sources of energy such as black liquor and wood waste 
the market for such certificates is an emerging and somewhat illiquid market 
the extent and value of future revenues from rec sales is dependent on many factors outside of management s control 
therefore  we may not be able to generate additional sales of recs in future periods 
in addition  the certification by the public utility commission of ohio of our chillicothe  oh facility as a renewable energy generator was appealed by a consumer advocacy group 
while we believe the certification will be upheld  we are unable to predict its ultimate outcome 
in composite fibers  net sales were million  a decline of million from operating income declined by million in the comparison to million 
total volumes shipped by this business unit declined led by lower shipments of composite laminates and food beverage paper products  which declined and  respectively 
the translation of foreign currencies adversely impacted net sales by million  however  higher average selling prices contributed million

the credit  equal to per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture  is refundable to the taxpayer 
on may   we were notified by the internal revenue service that our application to be registered as an alternative fuel mixer was approved 
we received a payment from the internal revenue service on june  in the amount of million for the alternative fuel mixture consumed at our spring grove  pa and chillicothe  oh facilities during the period february  through may  since we began mixing and burning eligible alternative fuels  we have earned million of alternative fuel mixture credits of which million has been received in cash  million was used to reduce estimated interim tax payments and million will be claimed as refundable income tax credits and is expected to be realized in cash primarily in the first half of we record all alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
according to the internal revenue code  the tax credit expired on december  pension expense income the following table summarizes the amounts of pension expense or income recognized for compared to year ended december in thousands change recorded as costs of products sold sg a expense total the amount of pension expense or income recognized each year is determined using various actuarial assumptions and certain other factors  including the fair value of our pension assets as of the beginning of the year
