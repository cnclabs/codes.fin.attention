item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview badger meter s core competency is flow measurement solutions 
the company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of products incorporating liquid flow measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other technology companies 
its products are used in a wide variety of applications  including water  oil and chemicals 
the company s product lines fall into two categories water applications and specialty applications 
water applications  the larger category by sales volume  include the sale of water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues 
the market for the company s water meter products is north america  primarily the united states  because the meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the american water works association 
the company s products are also sold for other water purposes including irrigation  water reclamation and industrial process applications 
specialty applications include the sale of meters and related technologies and services for measuring a wide variety of fluids in industries such as food and beverage  pharmaceutical production  petroleum  heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac  and measuring and dispensing automotive fluids 
it also includes the sales of technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
additional information about the company s business is described in part  item business under the heading market and products in this annual report on form k 
business trends increasingly  the electric utility industry relies on ami technology for two way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer s site 
although the company does not sell products for electric market applications  the trend toward ami is now affecting the markets in which the company does participate  particularly the water utility market 
specifically  ami enables water utilities to capture interval readings from each meter daily 
while two way communication is currently limited in water ami  utilities are contemplating two way network benefits 
as noted above  the company markets the orion amr products as well as the galaxy ami products 
the company sells either product in response to customer requirements 
since both products have comparable margins  any acceleration or slowdown in the trend toward ami is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s net sales related to amr and ami technology 
there are approximately  water utilities in the united states and the company estimates that less than of them have converted to an amr or ami technology 
although there is growing interest in ami communication by water utilities  the vast majority of utilities installing amr or ami technology continue to select amr technologies for their applications 
the company s orion technology has experienced rapid acceptance in the united states as an increasing number of water utilities have selected orion as their amr solution 
the company anticipates that even with growing interest in ami  amr will continue to be the primary product of choice for a number of years 
for many water utilities  amr technology is simply the most cost effective solution available 
revenue and product mix prior to the company s introduction of its own proprietary amr products orion  itron water utility related products were a dominant amr contributor to the company s results 
itron products are sold under an agreement between the company and itron  inc that is scheduled to expire in early the company s orion products directly compete with itron water amr products 
in recent years  many of the company s customers have selected orion products over itron products 
while orion sales were times greater than those of the itron licensed products for  and times greater for  the company expects that the itron products will remain a significant component of sales to utilities 
continuing sales in both product lines underscores the continued acceptance of amr technology by water utilities and affirms the company s strategy of selling itron products in addition to its own proprietary products 
as the industry continues to evolve  there may be additional opportunities for revenue enhancement 
for instance  in recent years the company has been asked to oversee and perform field installation of its products for selected customers 
the company assumes the role of general contractor  hiring an installation subcontractor and supervising their work 
the company also sells extended service programs for the technology sold with its products 
the extended service programs provide additional services beyond the standard warranty 
in  the company also began selling orion radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
revenues from such products and services are not yet significant and the company is uncertain of the potential growth achievable for such products and services in future periods 
results of operations net sales the company s net sales decreased by million  or  in to million from million in the decrease was driven by lower sales of the company s products due principally to volume declines  offset somewhat by higher prices on certain products 
water application products represented of total net sales in compared to in sales declined in all water application product lines 
sales of water application products decreased to million  a decrease from sales in of million 
this decrease was driven by lower volumes of meters sold  both with and without amr ami technologies 
while the state of the economy certainly played a role in the sales decline  the company also believes some customers have delayed purchasing decisions because of the possibility that funds will become available under us government stimulus programs 
sales of the company s orion amr technology products decreased from levels and sales of the itron related products saw a decrease from levels 
in  orion related products outsold itron related products by a ratio of to commercial meter sales decreased nearly due to volume declines compared to  which was an exceptionally strong year for these products 
specialty products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales declined by million  or  to million in from million in due to volume declines related to the current economic slowdown 
international sales for water application meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in canada and mexico  which use similar mechanical technology as customers in the us international sales for other water application and specialty application products are comprised primarily of sales of small valves  electromagnetic meters and automotive fluid meters in europe  sales of electromagnetic meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros 
other international sales are made in us dollars or local currencies 
international sales decreased by to million in from million in due equally to lower sales of products in europe and mexico and to foreign currency translation effects 
badger meter s net sales increased by million  or  in to million from million in the increase was driven primarily by higher volumes of water application products  particularly water meters with amr ami technologies 
products sold for water applications represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased to million  a increase over sales in of million 
this increase was driven primarily by increased volumes in amr ami sales over levels 
sales of the company s orion amr technology products increased over from levels and sales of the itron related products saw a increase from levels 
in  orion related products outsold itron related products by a ratio of to commercial meter sales increased over from to due to both volume and price increases 
specialty products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in due to volume increases in valve sales 
international sales increased by to million in from million in due principally to higher sales of products in europe and mexico 
gross margins gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins increased in over as a result of lower commodity costs  particularly copper that was substantially under levels  and the favorable effects of manufacturing cost control efforts 
partially offsetting this was the effect of lower sales of certain higher margin products  including products that are sold with amr ami technologies 
gross margins increased in over as a result of increases in amr volumes driven by sales of orion and itron related products  as well as price increases put into effect to recover higher cost of materials  particularly copper 
also included in gross margin for was a pre tax gain of  associated with the sale of the company s rio rico  arizona facility 
the increase in gross margin in was partially offset by lower specialty product application sales which generally have higher margins  the mix of amr technologies sold  and higher sales of turnkey or installation projects on which margins are lower for the services provided 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs decreased by nearly million  or  in compared to and as the result of lower commissions payable on lower sales volumes  lower employee incentives  headcount reductions  favorable healthcare experience and continuing cost control efforts 
this was offset somewhat by a full year s amortization of the galaxy fixed network ami technology compared to a partial year in  additional costs for qualifying for us government stimulus fund program requests  early retirement and severance expenses and normal inflationary increases 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased by nearly million  or in compared to and were the result of increased selling costs related to efforts to establish a presence for orion in the natural gas industry  increased costs associated with higher sales volumes  consulting costs associated with sales process enhancements  increased research and development costs  the effects of foreign exchange  and increased intangible amortization related to the acquisition of the north american rights for the galaxy fixed network ami technology in the second quarter of in addition  the company experienced normal inflationary increases  which were somewhat offset by continuing cost containment efforts 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was million in compared to interest expense of million in the decrease was due to the reversal of million that was previously accrued between and june  relating to the french tax issue discussed below and lower overall debt balances 
interest expense increased slightly in compared to as the result of higher debt levels due primarily to the acquisition of the north american rights for the galaxy fixed network technology 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes remained relatively flat at  and for  and  respectively 
earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as a result of the above mentioned items  earnings from continuing operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from continuing operations were  and respectively  for the same periods 
discontinued operations the results include recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for certain deductions that were taken on prior tax returns related to the shutdown of the company s french subsidiaries  which have been reflected as a discontinued operation 
these tax benefits million were recognized as earnings from discontinued operations in due to the realization that such tax benefits became more likely than not upon the conclusion of an irs audit of the company s federal income tax return 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from discontinued operations for were 
in addition  interest expense for was a credit balance in continuing operations  because it included an interest expense reversal of million that was previously accrued between and june  relating to this uncertain tax position 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operations in was due to lower inventory balances and improved earnings  partially offset by contributions to the company s pension plan 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in was due to higher receivable and inventory balances  partially offset by improved earnings 
receivables at december  were relatively unchanged compared to december  inventories at december  decreased million  or  compared to december   due to the decreased sales activity  the timing of inventory purchases and a focus on effectively managing inventory levels 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
included in capital expenditures for and were approximately million and million  respectively  related to the construction of two facilities in mexico and a small addition to the czech republic facility 
the company believes it has adequate capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures 
intangible assets decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  due to normal amortization expense 
long term deferred income tax assets decreased by million to million at december  from million at december   reflecting the tax impact of the company s payments into its pension plan in and the realization of previously deferred tax deductions 
short term debt  the current portion of long term debt and long term debt all declined from december  to december  these accounts totaled million at december   a decrease from million at december  as the company continued to use cash generated from operations to reduce debt levels 
at the end of  debt represented of the company s total capitalization 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is secured 
payables decreased by million at december  compared to december  primarily as the result of the timing of purchases and the reduced inventory levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the activity in the fourth quarter of accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased million between years due primarily to lower employee incentives 
warranty and after sale costs decreased million to million at december  due to fewer warranty claims as the result of improved manufacturing processes for products introduced in recent years 
other accrued employee benefits decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to a million contribution to the company s pension plan 
income and other taxes decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was due to the timing of tax payments and the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax benefits related to the company s discontinued french subsidiaries 
common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due primarily to the exercise of stock options  stock compensation expense and the tax benefit on stock options 
treasury stock decreased slightly due to shares issued in connection the company s dividend reinvestment program 
accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by million  net of tax  primarily due to changes in the funded status of the company s pension plan and other postretirement benefits 
despite the current economic climate  the company s financial condition remains strong 
in october  the company renewed its principal line of credit increasing it to million for one year with its primary lender 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and the development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market 
the company had million of unused credit lines available at december  off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  contractual obligations the company guarantees the outstanding debt of its employee savings and stock option plan the essop that is recorded in long term debt  offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity

payments of  and  in and  respectively  reduced the loan to  at december  the terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal and interest payment due on april   at which time the loan is expected to be renewed 
the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands current portion and long term debt accrued interest on current portion and long term debt short term debt essop operating leases total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  the company does not expect to make a contribution for the calendar year 
postretirement medical claims are paid by the company as they are submitted  and they are anticipated to be  in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to the following judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the health care reserve for claims incurred  as well as claims incurred but not reported 
each of these reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most likely amount based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these methods have been used for all years in the presented financials and have been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates if actual experiences vary from the company s assumptions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts vary by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility  while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios 
the calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends 
the health care reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in the company also uses estimates in four other significant areas i pension and other postretirement obligations and costs  ii stock based compensation  iii income taxes  and iv evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually for impairment 
the actuarial valuations of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted  adjusted for forfeitures 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures  which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the reserve for uncertainty in income taxes is a matter of judgment based on an evaluation of the individual facts and circumstances of each tax position in light of all available evidence  including historic data and current trends 
a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits of each tax position 
goodwill impairment  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value of the operating unit with its carrying value 
the company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions quarterly 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
other matters the company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations 
currently  the company is in the process of resolving matters relating to two landfill sites where it has been named as one of many potentially responsible parties and to a parcel of land adjoining the company s property 
the landfill sites are impacted by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and other environmental laws and regulations 
at this time  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
regarding the landfill sites  this belief is based on the company s assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of and government focus on other named third parties with these landfill sites 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters 
a future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the company  off site disposal locations used by the company  and property owned by third parties that is near such sites  could result in future costs to the company and such amounts could be material 
expenditures during  and for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations were not material 
like other companies in recent years  the company has been named as a defendant in numerous multi claimant multi defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos  manufactured by third parties  and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the company s products 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has proven or substantially demonstrated asbestos exposure caused by products manufactured or sold by the company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k and part i  item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s financial performance and results of operations 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and amr ami systems for water utilities 
a number of the company s competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products  particularly those that provide amr ami connectivity solutions 
in addition  the market s level of acceptance of the company s newer products may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company s ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  including to some extent such things as the length and severity of the current global economic downturn  the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus funds programs  the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of the company s products  the company s ability to obtain financing  housing starts in the united states  and overall industrial activity 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for amr ami products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company s control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company s operations 
the company relies on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include metal or alloys such as bronze  which uses copper as its main component  aluminum  stainless steel  cast iron  brass and stellite  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers and purchases of material from foreign vendors 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
fixed rate debt was principally two us dollar term loans with a and interest rate  respectively  and a euro revolving term loan with a interest rate 
for the short term floating rate debt  future annual interest costs will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk information required by this item is set forth in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading market risks in this annual report on form k
