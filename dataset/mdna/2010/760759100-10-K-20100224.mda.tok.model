item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our business and consolidated results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
during the past several years  we supported our internal growth strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average population growth 
we believe our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than those of declining population growth 
we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial  operating and growth strategies 
in order to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved  we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics which include increasing free cash flow  achieving targeted earnings  maintaining and improving returns on invested capital  as well as achieving and maintaining integration synergies 
our financial  operating and growth strategies are described further herein 
financial strategy key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital 
our definition of free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends  repurchasing our stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine management s compensation 
we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital  which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on invested capital 
our strategy includes customer service 
we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles  equipment  landfills and facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve 
because of the economic slowdown  we were able to lower our capital reinvestment during below that which otherwise would have been expected for the combined companies 
however  we remain acutely focused on ensuring that we are not under investing in our business and that we have the appropriate complement of physical assets to take advantage of additional business resulting from an economic recovery 
in addition  we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices 
we believe that these in turn will help us achieve profitable growth 
internal growth 
price growth 
growth through price increases helps ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial capital investment and the business risk associated with such investment 
price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs  which ultimately enhances our operating margins 
volume growth 
growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business 
this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers  but also includes investing in information 
table of contents tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business 
we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 
debt 
during  payments of debt net of borrowings were million 
during  we repaid approximately billion of senior notes and amounts outstanding under our credit facilities primarily using proceeds from offering billion of senior notes  proceeds from disposition of assets and cash flow from operations 
as a result  we reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes  on a weighted average basis  by more than basis points while extending our debt maturities thereby giving greater stability to our capital structure 
furthermore  we anticipate taking advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our financial risk by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay existing debt 
credit ratings 
we believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt  which was rated bbb by standard poor s  bbb by fitch and baa by moody s as of december  such ratings have allowed us  and should continue to allow us  to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 
our cash utilization strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment grade ratings 
dividends 
in july  our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter  the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of  representing an average annualized growth rate of approximately 
our current quarterly cash dividend per share is 
we will consider increasing our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance shareholder value 
market growth and optimization 
within our markets  our goal is to deliver sustainable  long term profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return 
we allocate capital to businesses  markets and development projects to support growth while achieving acceptable rates of return 
we develop previously non permitted  non contiguous landfill sites greenfield landfill sites 
we also expand our existing landfill sites  when possible 
we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets  such as landfills  transfer stations  and tuck in acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets 
we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital 
where operations are not generating acceptable returns  we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through the integration of additional assets 
if such enhancements are not possible  we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 
share repurchase 
once we reduce our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in our credit agreement  we will consider reinstituting our share repurchase program 
we believe that this may occur sometime during we intend to execute our financial strategy while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of market growth opportunities and maintaining our investment grade ratings 
ebitda is a non gaap measure 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies 
for certain risks related to our financial strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
operating strategy we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value 
our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive management team  integrate waste operations  utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing day to day operations  
table of contents improve operating margins through economies of scale  cost efficiencies and asset utilization  achieve high levels of customer satisfaction  and utilize business information systems to improve consistency in financial and operational performance 
experienced executive management team 
we believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry 
james e 
o connor  who has served as our chief executive officer ceo since december  also became our chairman in january he worked at waste management  inc from to and from to during that time  he served in various management positions  including senior vice president in and  and area president of waste management of florida  inc from to mr 
o connor has years of experience in the solid waste industry 
donald w 
slager became our president and chief operating officer coo upon our merger with allied in december prior to the merger  mr 
slager worked for allied from through and served in various management positions  including president and coo from through and executive vice president and coo from to from to  mr 
slager served as senior vice president  operations 
he held various management positions at allied from to  and was previously general manager at national waste services  where he served in various management positions since mr 
slager has over years of experience in the solid waste industry 
tod c

holmes served as our vice president of finance from june until august and as vice president of finance of our former parent company s solid waste group from january until june from to  mr 
holmes served in various management positions with browning ferris industries  inc  including vice president  investor relations from to  divisional vice president  collection operations from to  divisional vice president and regional controller northern region from to  and divisional vice president and assistant corporate controller from to mr 
holmes has over years of experience in the solid waste industry 
our regional senior vice presidents have an average of years of experience in the industry 
continuing merger integration strategy 
on december  we completed our merger with allied 
we believe that our merger integration strategy is well underway  and we continue to believe this merger is different from historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a number of reasons  including the following two mature companies 
most previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a roll up strategy often involving relatively young companies solely focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions 
our merger with allied involved two mature companies with similar business practices and performance metrics that have been developed and refined over the course of a number of years 
we believe that the combination of our maturity and proven business practices and performance metrics has been a critical component of our success in and will be a critical component of our future success 
best practices 
our merger also affords us the opportunity to select the best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of two successful companies 
republic had a history of financial discipline evident in the consistent generation of increasing levels of free cash flow 
allied was noted for its integrated operations and focus on procurement 
we believe that our merger has given us an unique opportunity to combine the strengths of these two successful organizations and create a best in class waste management company 
timely and focused integration process 
we are acutely aware that previous acquisitions in the waste management and other industries failed because of a lack of focus on integration 
as such  we began to develop our integration process and strategy in june  long before our merger was consummated 
our process identified specific integration related tasks focused on all levels of the 
table of contents organization  especially our individual business units 
we engaged employees at all levels of the company to develop a detailed integration plan and to ensure that each of our employees understands their role in the process 
the integration process is well underway and is ahead of schedule 
strong operating platform 
the merger has created a company with a strong  national operating platform 
the foundation of this platform is our large network of disposal sites 
this disposal network provides us with a far stronger vertically integrated operating structure than either company would have been able to achieve on its own 
we believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will be a key driver of our future profitability 
complementary operations and cultures 
the overlay of our operating locations reflects another compelling attribute of our merger 
republic and allied operated complementary geographies and shared very similar cultures that are centered on a commitment to providing industry leading solid waste and environmental services that exceed our customers highest expectations 
significant synergies 
prior to the effective date of our merger with allied  we identified million of annual run rate integration synergies 
we also developed a detailed plan for realizing this goal that includes participation at all levels throughout the company from the drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of directors 
this plan anticipated achieving million of annual run rate integration synergies by the end of fiscal as of december   we have already met our original goal of million of run rate synergies and have increased our total goal for annual run rate synergies to million to million 
we expect to achieve this goal by the end of strong capital structure 
republic enjoys a strong capital structure and investment grade credit ratings post merger 
our combination with allied has created a company that produces substantial annual free cash flow 
this strong cash producing characteristic will allow us to pursue our mission of increasing shareholder value by focusing on investing in our business  paying down our debt  funding dividends and reinstituting our share repurchase program 
decentralized management structure 
we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our day to day operations more efficiently 
our local management has extensive industry experience in growing  operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets 
each regional management team includes a senior vice president  vice president controller  vice president of human resources  vice president of sales  vice president of operations support  director of safety  director of engineering and environmental management  and director of market planning and development 
we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our organization 
our regional management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority  responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets 
compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income produced and the free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager s geographic area of responsibility 
in addition  through long term incentive programs  including stock options  we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams 
as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities  we are proactive in anticipating our customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets 
we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to improve operating margins 
integrated operations 
we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
we expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non integrated markets 
through acquisitions  landfill operating agreements and other market development activities  we create market specific  integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies  transfer stations and landfills 
we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volume 
we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills 
in addition  we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have 
table of contents significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 
this increase in internalization is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in our merger with allied 
in a number of our larger markets  we and our competitors are required to take waste to government controlled disposal facilities flow control 
this provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 
because we do not have landfill facilities or government controlled disposal facilities for all markets in which we provide collection services  we believe that landfill and transfer station acquisitions  operating agreements  and market development give us the opportunity to increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our operations 
by further integrating operations in existing markets  we may be able to reduce our disposal costs 
economies of scale  cost efficiencies and asset utilization 
we continue to identify and implement best practices throughout our organization with the goal of permanently improving overall operating and financial results 
these best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our operations such as landfill operations  truck routing  maintenance and related service efficiencies  purchasing and administrative activities 
the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing  personnel  equipment and vehicle maintenance  inventories and back office administration 
generally  we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs 
of particular benefit are the opportunities associated with the blending of operations as a result of the allied merger 
scheduled for full completion by the first half of  these markets offer the potential for marked improvement in operating results 
generally speaking  there are significant opportunities in these markets to leverage economies of scale and the existing asset base  while realizing improved operating efficiencies 
upon the completion of the integration of allied  our goal is to maintain our selling  general and administrative costs at no more than of revenue  which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 
in addition  our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate the best volume discounts for goods and services purchased  including waste disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties 
furthermore  we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets 
for example  to reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operating density 
by using assets more efficiently  operating expenses can be reduced 
high levels of customer satisfaction 
we strive to provide the highest level of service to our customer base 
our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer satisfaction and to verify that we are providing the appropriate level of service 
in addition to visiting existing customers  a salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each market 
we also have municipal marketing representatives in most service areas that are responsible for working with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction 
additionally  the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 
focus on systems utilization 
we continue to invest in the integration and expansion of our information systems and technology platform 
our future platform will consist of best in class legacy systems from both republic and allied 
during  we converted the entire company to a single payable and general ledger system 
additionally  we made significant progress in converting to a single operating system 
we expect to complete our operating system conversion by the third quarter of in addition  during january  we converted the entire company to a single payroll and human resource system 
our future technology related initiatives will include customer relationship management  billing  productivity and maintenance systems 
we believe that the combination of these systems will prove to be a competitive advantage for our company 
for certain risks related to our operating strategy  see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents growth strategy our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue  gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions 
we manage our growth strategy as follows internal growth 
our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining new commercial  municipal and industrial customers through our well managed sales and marketing activities 
pricing activities 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs  to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
during  we continued to secure broad based price increases across all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital and operating costs 
price increases will remain a major component of our overall future operating strategy 
long term contracts 
we seek to obtain long term contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing populations 
these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts 
by obtaining such long term agreements  we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets 
we believe it is important to have secured exclusive  long term franchise agreements in growing market areas 
we believe that this positions us to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry s overall growth rate 
in addition  we believe that by securing a base of long term recurring revenue in growing population markets  we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 
sales and marketing activities 
we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate 
we provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of our national clients  centralizing services to effectively manage their needs  such as minimizing their procurement costs 
we currently have approximately  sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue 
for the most part  these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel 
in addition  we utilize a customer relationship management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
development activities 
we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream 
where appropriate  we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations  recycling facilities  and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites 
development projects  while generally less capital intensive than acquiring such projects  typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success 
we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 
acquisition growth 
we look to acquire businesses that complement our existing business platform 
our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held solid waste companies and the waste operations of municipal and other local governmental authorities 
we believe that our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry  increasing capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste regulatory requirements  and the limited number of exit strategies for these privately held companies owners 
we also seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing  as they seek to increase available capital and reduce risk 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies 
in sum  our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth in existing and new markets  acquiring well managed companies and  when appropriate  retaining local management  and 
table of contents acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing and from publicly owned companies that are divesting of assets 
we also seek to acquire landfills  transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal 
in addition  we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform 
these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share  lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue  and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 
for certain risks related to our growth strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
operations our operations primarily consist of the collection  transfer and disposal of non hazardous solid waste 
collection services 
we provide solid waste collection services to commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies 
in  of our revenue was derived from collection services 
within the collection line of business  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers  is from services provided to commercial customers  and is from services provided to industrial and other customers 
our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills 
residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities  which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions 
these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years  although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods 
residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis  in which individual households contract directly with us 
the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors  frequency and type of service  the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 
in general  subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 
in our commercial and industrial collection operations  we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes 
we also rent compactors to large waste generators 
commercial collection services are generally performed under one to three year service agreements  and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors  collection frequency  type of equipment furnished  the type and volume or weight of the waste collected  transportation costs  the distance to the disposal facility  and the cost of disposal 
we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer 
our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors 
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 
we also provide recycling services in certain markets in compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise agreements 
these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 
transfer and disposal services 
we own or operate transfer stations 
we deposit waste at these transfer stations  as do other private haulers and municipal haulers  for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities 
in  transfer and disposal services accounted for of our revenue 
as of december   we owned or operated active landfills  which had approximately  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately billion in place cubic yards 
the in place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors  requirements of regulatory authorities  our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations  and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain 
table of contents expansion permits at our sites 
some of our landfills accept non hazardous special waste  including utility ash  asbestos and contaminated soils 
most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage 
we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices  market needs  remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion 
to satisfy future disposal demand  we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills 
however  we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 
we also have responsibility for closed landfills  for which we have associated closure and post closure obligations 
landfill gas and renewable energy projects 
during  we brought eleven landfill gas to energy projects on line  bringing our total number of such projects to or over one third of our active landfills 
these projects consist of the following electric generating plants powered by landfill gas  medium btu plants that provide landfill gas to industrial users  high btu plants that produce pipeline quality gas  and projects that use landfill gas to power leachate evaporating equipment 
our electric projects generate megawatts of electricity  enough to power approximately  homes 
our other projects provide or process more than  square cubic feet per minute of gas  enough to heat almost  homes 
the environmental benefit of all of our projects combined is the equivalent of removing nearly million cars from the road 
during  we also combined a first of its kind solar technology with an existing gas to energy system which turned our tessman road landfill in san antonio  texas into a sustainable energy park 
a closed portion of the landfill is now capped with a solar energy cover  developed by republic  which generates electricity for homes and businesses in the surrounding area 
we expect to install a similar system at one or more of our landfills during many of our landfills that do not have gas to energy or renewable energy projects are capable of supporting such projects 
as a result  we intend to bring several of these projects on line each year for many years to come 
recycling facilities and other services 
we own or operate materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations 
these facilities sort recyclable paper  aluminum  glass and other materials 
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations 
in some areas  we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and non recyclable waste 
the recyclable materials are salvaged  repackaged and sold to third parties  and the non recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 
sales and marketing we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction 
we derive our business from a broad customer base  which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth 
we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers  as well as attracting new customers 
we employ approximately  sales and marketing employees 
our sales and marketing strategy is to provide high quality  comprehensive solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices 
we target potential customers of all sizes  from small quantity generators to large fortune companies and municipalities 

table of contents most of our marketing activity is local in nature 
however  we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of some of our national and regional customers 
our national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner 
we partner with our national clients to reach their sustainability goals  optimize waste streams  balance equipment and service intervals  and provide customized reporting 
the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs  while helping minimize procurement costs 
with our extended geographic reach  our national accounts program effectively serves states and puerto rico 
as industry leaders  our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 
we generally do not change the trade names of the local businesses we acquire  and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name 
customers we provide services to a broad base of commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 
competition in the non hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large  national publicly owned companies  including waste management  inc  several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies  and thousands of small privately owned companies 
in any given market  competitors may have larger operations and greater resources 
in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies  we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations 
these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax exempt financing 
we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 
our ability to increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors 
this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather  which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
regulation our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements that regulate the environment  public health  safety  zoning and land use 
operating and other permits  licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations  certain solid waste collection vehicles  fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate 
these permits are subject to denial  revocation  modification and renewal in certain circumstances 
federal  state and local laws and regulations vary  but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges  air emissions  the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste  and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement  which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits  obtain injunctions  or impose fines or penalties in the case of violations  including 
table of contents criminal penalties 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal  state and local authorities administer these regulations 
we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and permits 
however  in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns  from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities 
we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts 
we have established final capping  closure  post closure and remediation liabilities that we believe  based on currently available information  will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs 
however  we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 
refer to the contractual obligations table within item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained elsewhere herein for further information 
federal regulation 
the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safety related statutes that affect our facilities and operations the solid waste disposal act  including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste  and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 
subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste 
regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines  including location restrictions  facility design and operating criteria  final capping  closure and post closure requirements  financial assurance standards  groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards  many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills 
each state was required to submit to the epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april  all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d 
these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d 
our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal  state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 
all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements 
operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations 
compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla 
cercla  among other things  provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site  parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of  parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site 
under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations  detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment 
liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes  but can also be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than substances characterized by the epa as hazardous  many of which are found in common household waste 
among other things  cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so 

table of contents in addition  the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 
cercla liability is strict liability 
it can be founded upon the release or threatened release  even as a result of unintentional  non negligent or lawful action  of hazardous substances  including very small quantities of such substances 
thus  even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste  it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other properties owned by third parties where we have transported to and disposed of waste or at our landfills or at other properties that we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated 
therefore  we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources  even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the federal water pollution control act of the clean water act 
this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources  including solid waste disposal sites  into streams  rivers and other waters of the united states 
point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring  and  under certain circumstances  reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges 
storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and discharges from industrial operations and facilities  which may affect our operations 
if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works  the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works 
in addition  states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills 
furthermore  development which alters or affects wetlands generally must be permitted prior to such development commencing  and permitting agencies may require mitigation 
the clean air act 
the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources  including landfills 
in march  the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems 
these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction  reconstruction or modification on or after may   and  principally  to landfills that can accommodate million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste 
the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed 
the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls  with resulting capital or operating costs 
see item a 
risk factors regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 
the occupational safety and health act of osha 
osha authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards 
a number of these standards  including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos  apply to our facilities and operations 
state and local regulation 
each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution  and  in most cases  releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters 
states also have adopted regulations governing the design  operation  maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations 
some counties  municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations 
our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 
in addition  our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs 
for example  several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce  through solid waste planning  composting  recycling or other programs  the volume of solid waste deposited in 
table of contents landfills 
additionally  laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills  including yard waste  newspapers  beverage containers  unshredded tires  lead acid batteries  electronic wastes and household appliances  have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others 
legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 
to construct  operate and expand a landfill  we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits  as well as zoning and land use approvals 
these permits and approvals may be difficult and time consuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with  are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups  may be subject to periodic renewal  and are subject to denial  modification  non renewal and revocation by the issuing agency 
in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills  we may be required to expend considerable time  effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 
other regulations 
many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum based products 
these tanks are generally subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing  upgrading  closure and removal  and that  in the event of leaks  require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated 
we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations 
if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak  we could be liable for response costs and  if the leakage migrates onto the property of others  we could be liable for damages to third parties 
we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
with regard to our solid waste transportation operations  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration  office of motor carriers  and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters 
various states and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated  or are considering enacting or promulgating  laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county  or other jurisdiction lines 
in  the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out of state solid waste was unconstitutional  however  states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling 
in  the supreme court ruled that a flow control law  which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation  imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce  and  therefore  was unconstitutional 
in  the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned waste facility 
a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries 
other governments may enact similar regulations in the future 
these regulations may  in some cases  cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 
we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs  which include landfill site final capping  closure and post closure costs 
we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra  and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping  closure and post closure costs accordingly 
based on current information and regulatory requirements  we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate 
however  environmental laws may change  and we cannot assure you that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations  future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations  or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 
liability insurance and bonding the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations  including possible damages to the environment 
such potential liabilities could involve  for example  claims for remediation costs  personal injury  property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held 
table of contents responsible for the escape of harmful materials  claims of employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations  or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work 
we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages  liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant 
our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
however  we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate  in scope or amount  in the event of a major loss  nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 
we have general liability  vehicle liability  employment practices liability  pollution liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation and employer s liability coverage  as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies 
we also carry property insurance 
although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have  subject to limitations and exclusions  substantial liability insurance  we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
claims in excess of self insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions 
accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  increased self insurance retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
in the normal course of business  we post performance bonds  insurance policies  letters of credit  or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts  the operation  closure or post closure of landfills  environmental remediation  environmental permits  and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance 
to date  we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit  insurance policies or surety bonds 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
from time to time  our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts 
we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages 
we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business 
our management believes that we have good relations with our employees

except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation  we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this annual report on form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
we have substantial indebtedness  which may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding 
this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business  to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases  to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry  and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments 
further  our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  reducing dividends  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt  or seeking additional equity capital 
the downturn in the us economy may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results 
a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated 
in  weakness in the us economy had a negative effect on our revenue  operating results and operating cash flows 
the current and previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities 
as a result of the global economic crisis  we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well 
we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
further  we cannot assure you that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate  or any  improvement in our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies  large national accounts and others 
the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies 
we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities 
these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be 
table of contents unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  the weak economy may cause other customers  including our large national accounts  to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counter party risk associated with our derivatives 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates  we have entered into a number of derivative agreements 
these derivative agreements require us or the counter party to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary from a specified amount 
a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counter parties with which we do business  potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements 
this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources  flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
we principally compete with large national waste management companies  municipalities and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts 
competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services 
competition for disposal business is primarily based on disposal costs  geographic location and quality of operations 
some of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than us 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or tax exempt financing 
our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste 
in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill  our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 
as a result of these factors  we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets 
if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues  it could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability 
price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs including fuel and environmental costs  to improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share 
contractual  general economic or market specific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices 
as a result  we may be unable to offset increases in costs  improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases 
we may also lose volume to lower cost competitors 
increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our operating expenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 
we depend on fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection  transfer  and disposal 
we buy fuel in the open market 
fuel prices are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control  including geopolitical developments  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers  supply and demand for oil and gas  war  terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries  and regional production patterns 
we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges 
for example  our fuel costs were million in  representing of our cost of operations compared to million in  representing of our cost of operations 
this decrease in fuel costs as a percent of our cost of operations primarily reflects a decrease in the price of fuel 

table of contents in order to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices  we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties if the price of fuel varies from a specified amount 
however  we do not hedge our entire fuel usage 
during  only of our fuel purchases were hedged 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions and  in october  the epa indicated it will establish the first us standards for greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles 
the regulations could affect the type of fuel our trucks use and could materially increase the cost and consumption of our fuel 
our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties 
our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change  any of which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 
we currently have matters pending with the internal revenue service the irs  which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we are currently under examination by the irs with regard to allied s federal income tax returns for tax years and  and allied s through federal income tax returns are at appeals 
republic is under audit for its and federal income tax returns  and under examination for its federal income tax return 
during its examination of allied s tax year  the irs asserted that a redemption of four partnership interests in waste to energy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions 
this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs 
the company believes its position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter 
the potential tax and interest through december  to the extent unpaid have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet 
a disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made 
the accrual of additional interest charges through the time this matter is resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penalty related interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  during its examination of allied s through tax years  the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills 
the irs position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and  therefore  associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed 
we believe we have several meritorious defenses  including the fact that methane gas is 
table of contents not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services 
therefore  we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for additional information on these matters  see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 
our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt 
the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future 
our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 
our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business  fund internal growth  acquire other solid waste businesses  pay dividends  reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings  and take other actions to enhance shareholder value 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broad based pricing program  we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy  we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate  that we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends  or that we will be able to reinstitute our share repurchase program 
a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 
while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity  they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term 
if the rating agencies downgrade our debt  this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt  and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt 
if our debt ratings are downgraded  future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost  or at all  also may be adversely impacted 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations  which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 
our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth  it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend 
additionally  if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase 
our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping  closure  post closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates  which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal  state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control 
increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions 
these regulations have caused some increases in the costs of the collection vehicles we buy 
the epa recently has indicated it intends to adopt further regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles 
as a result  we could experience an increase in capital costs 
this also could cause an increase in vehicle operating costs or a reduction in operating efficiency 
we may reduce the number of vehicles we purchase until manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase efficiency 

table of contents we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills  which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning  environmental and other regulations 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
local communities and citizen groups  adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need  allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject  or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage 
responding to these challenges has  at times  increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 
in addition  failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities  maintaining permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 
the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation  and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations  increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 
if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping  closure and post closure costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance commenced  once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized 
we have significant financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills  and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills 
we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping  closure and post closure financial obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals  and our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
additionally  if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason  the accruals for capping  closure and post closure could be required to be accelerated  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 
most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling  or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard waste  at landfills 
although such actions are useful in protecting our environment  these actions  as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives  have and may in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 

table of contents the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects  expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 
we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development  expansion and other projects 
if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired  or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale  transfer or otherwise 
in future periods  we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy  or other events may cause impairments 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow control regulations that may affect our operating margins  restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 
complying with laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly 
laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping  closure and post closure  and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
our collection  transfer  and landfill operations are  and may in the future continue to be  affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county or other jurisdictional lines 
such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations  resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations  or who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures  or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license  or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued 
such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs  to ameliorate the effect of climate change  continue to advance on the federal  regional  and state level 
our landfill operations emit methane  identified as a ghg 
in june  the us house of representatives passed a bill that would regulate ghgs comprehensively 
while the centerpiece of that bill would be a ghg emission allowance cap and trade system  landfills would not be compelled to hold allowances for their ghg emissions 
rather  they would be subject to certain further emission controls to be determined through administrative rule making 
senate passage of counterpart legislation  and whether such legislation would treat landfills in the same manner  is uncertain 
should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted  we expect it to impose costs on our operations  the materiality of which we cannot predict 
absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions  epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority 
in october  epa published a proposed prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule psd tailoring rule 
the proposed rule would set new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits would be required and 
table of contents would tailor these programs to limit which facilities would be required to obtain permits 
epa s legal authority to tailor this rule in the manner it proposed has been challenged 
if finalized as proposed  many of our landfills would be subject to the psd tailoring rule  which could require permit amendments and additional emission controls 
in december  epa finalized its finding that six ghgs endanger public health 
while epa made its finding in the context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles  other clean air act provisions appear to compel epa to make comparable findings for stationary sources  such as landfills 
we cannot predict the requirements or effective date of stationary source rules that might apply to landfills as a result of this endangerment finding and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that further developments in this area will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance 
changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage 
if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability 
this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
also  due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we may experience future increases in self insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
despite our efforts  we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla  which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed of  and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie  generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability under cercla or similar laws in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired 
actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and from time to time become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain 
additionally  the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments  adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may experience difficulties completing the integration of allied s business  and we may incur unexpected expenses in connection with that integration 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with allied will depend significantly on whether we can continue to integrate allied s business in an efficient and effective manner 
the ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses  and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be fully realized 
we may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly  successfully or on a timely basis 
any inability of our management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits from the merger with allied fully or within the timing anticipated 
we believe our merger with allied has been and will continue to be beneficial to our stockholders as a result of the actual and anticipated synergies resulting from the combined operations 
while we are currently ahead of our original timeline  we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or the long term strategic benefits of the merger fully or within the timing anticipated 
for example  elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated 
for at least the first year after an acquisition  and possibly longer  the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations 
the inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger  or our encountering unexpected costs or delays in the integration process which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 
to continue our growth  we may need to add administrative and other personnel  and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 
we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 
our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business 
the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management 
in addition  competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates 
as such  we cannot assure you that desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified  we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified  we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire  or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 
if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy  our growth prospects could be adversely affected 
businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 
in pursuing our acquisition strategy  our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental  remediation or contractual  as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by 
table of contents conducting due diligence  by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies  by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 
our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management 
actual results could differ from these amounts 
significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of long lived assets  the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs  accruals for final capping  closure and post closure costs  valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation  claims and assessments  and liabilities for environmental remediation  employee benefit and pension plans  deferred taxes  uncertain tax positions and self insurance 
we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations  future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations  or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 
the introduction of new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 
complying with new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
we may be subject to workforce influences  including work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized  our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to at least multi employer pension plans covering at least of our current employees 
we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in the ppa requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
based on the information available to us  we believe that some of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans and  therefore  have not recorded any related liabilities 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
furthermore  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each  a withdrawal event  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multi employer pension plans to which we contribute or that  in the event of such a withdrawal event  the amounts we would be 
table of contents required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions  and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities 
our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets 
our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions  which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  interest rates and other factors 
a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects 
our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers 
the loss of the services of key employees and officers  whether such loss is through resignation or other causes  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects

table of contents the following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us 
although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  except as otherwise described below  we do not believe that the outcome of our pending litigation  environmental and other administrative proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
litigation  environmental and other administrative matters countywide matters on march   the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued final findings and orders f os to republic services of ohio ii  llc republic ohio  an ohio limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary 
the f os related to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum production waste at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide in east sparta  ohio 
the f os  and certain other remedial actions republic ohio agreed with the oepa to undertake to address the environmental conditions  included  without limitation  the following actions a prohibiting leachate recirculation  b refraining from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the site  c updating engineering plans and specifications and providing further information regarding the integrity of various engineered components at the site  d performing additional data collection  e taking additional measures to address emissions  f expanding the gas collection and control system  g installing an isolation break  h removing liquids from gas extraction wells  and i submitting a plan to the oepa to suppress the chemical reaction and  following approval by the oepa  implementing such plan 
republic ohio has performed certain interim remedial actions required by the oepa 
republic ohio subsequently received additional orders from the oepa requiring certain actions to be taken by republic ohio  in addition to or in lieu of requirements contained in prior orders  including additional air quality monitoring and the installation and continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems 
on september   republic ohio entered into two legally binding agreements with the state of ohio designed to further refine the activities necessary to resolve alleged compliance and licensing issues at the countywide facility 
the first agreement is a consent order that resolves ongoing allegations of noncompliance at the facility and reflects agreements regarding the status of facility licensing 
the allegations of noncompliance were summarized in a complaint that was filed by the ohio attorney general in the stark county court of common pleas and resolved the same day in accordance with terms of an agreed upon consent order entered into between republic ohio and the state of ohio 
the consent order with ohio requires republic ohio to pay civil penalties and financial relief of million  submit updated permit documents  and assess  evaluate  and determine the appropriate time to address certain compliance issues at the facility 
all civil penalties and financial relief required by the consent order have been satisfied 
compliance with the terms of the consent order and other applicable rules will result in countywide being considered to be in substantial compliance or on a legally enforceable schedule to return to compliance for annual licensing purposes 
the second agreement is a set of f os that were agreed to and entered into with the ohio epa 
the f os require the implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance program that contains specific requirements for managing the remediation area 
the operation and maintenance program is ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure of the acre remediation area at countywide 
the september  f os supersede all previous f os discussed above that were issued to republic ohio regarding the reaction in the remediation area of the landfill 
the operation and maintenance program requires countywide to  among other things  maintain the temporary cap and other engineering controls designed to prevent odors and isolate and contain the reaction 
the operation and maintenance program also contains provisions that require the installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when conditions become conducive to such installation 
republic ohio has also entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republic ohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system  b design and install a composite cap or cover  and c develop and implement an air monitoring program 
the aoc became effective on april  and republic ohio has 
table of contents complied with the terms of the aoc 
republic ohio also has completed construction of an isolation break under the authority and supervision of the epa and reimbursed the epa for certain costs associated with the epa s involvement in overseeing implementation of the aoc 
on november   the epa issued a notification of completion and determination of compliance to countywide memorializing countywide s completion of the work required under the aoc 
the commissioner of the stark county health department commissioner previously recommended that the stark county board of health board of health suspend countywide s annual operating license 
the commissioner also intended to recommend that the board of health deny countywide s license application for republic ohio obtained a preliminary injunction on november  prohibiting the board of health from suspending its operating license 
republic ohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on february  prohibiting the board of health from denying its operating license application 
the litigation with the board of health has been concluded pursuant to a consent order entered into between republic ohio and the board of health in the stark county court of common pleas 
the consent order requires the board of health to issue conditional and or final operating licenses to countywide and requires republic ohio to reimburse the board of health for certain expenses not to exceed  incurred related to monitoring and investigation of complaints regarding countywide 
countywide s operating license has been challenged by tuscarawas county  and the board of health issued countywide its operating license on december   which also has been challenged by a local citizens group  club we believe that we have performed or are diligently performing all actions required under the f os  the aoc  and any applicable consent orders and that countywide does not pose a threat to the environment 
additionally  we believe that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating license at countywide 
in a suit filed on october  in the tuscarawas county ohio court of common pleas  approximately plaintiffs have named republic services  inc and republic ohio as defendants 
the claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from the operation of countywide 
republic ohio has owned and operated countywide since february  waste management  inc and waste management ohio  inc  previous owners and operators of countywide  have been named as defendants as well 
plaintiffs are individuals and businesses located in the geographic area around countywide 
they claim that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and operational issues and conditions  the landfill has generated odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired the use and value of their property 
there are also allegations that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health effects 
a second almost identical lawsuit was filed on october  in the tuscarawas county ohio court of common pleas with approximately plaintiffs 
these plaintiffs named republic services  inc  republic ohio  waste management  inc  and waste management ohio  inc as defendants 
the relief requested on behalf of each plaintiff in both actions is an award of compensatory damages according to proof in an amount in excess of  for each of the three counts of the amended complaint  an award of punitive damages in the amount of two times compensatory damages  pursuant to applicable statute  or in such amount as may be awarded at trial for each of the three counts of the amended complaint  costs for medical screening and monitoring of each plaintiff  interest on the damages according to law  costs and disbursements of the lawsuit  reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses  and any other and further relief as the court deems just  proper and equitable 
we anticipate that the two cases will be consolidated 
answers have been filed in both cases and discovery is ongoing 
plaintiffs in the first case and plaintiffs in the second case have been dismissed or are in the process of being dismissed for failing to comply with discovery 
we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs allegations in both actions 
luri matter on august   a lawsuit was filed by a former employee  ronald luri v

on july   a jury verdict was awarded against us in the amount of million  including million in punitive damages 
on september   the court awarded pre judgment interest of million and attorney fees and litigation costs of million 
post 
table of contents judgment interest accrued at a rate of for and for  and is accruing at a rate of for management anticipates that post judgment interest could accrue through the middle of for a total of million 
post judgment motions filed on our behalf and certain of our subsidiaries were denied  and on october   we filed a notice of appeal 
the parties submitted their appeal briefs and oral argument was scheduled for october  on october   the court of appeals dismissed the appeal holding that the trial court had not entered a final  appealable order 
the case has been returned to the trial court for additional proceedings which may include entry of additional order s by the trial court followed by another appeal 
it is reasonably possible that following all appeals a final judgment of liability for compensatory and punitive damages may be assessed against us related to this matter 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome  management believes that the amount of any final  non appealable judgment will not be material 
forward matters the district attorney for san joaquin county filed a civil action against forward  inc and allied waste industries  inc 
on february  in the superior court of california  county of san joaquin 
forward and allied each filed answers in november  denying all material allegations of the complaint 
the complaint seeks civil penalties of  for each alleged violation  but no less than million  and an injunction against forward and allied for alleged permit and regulatory violations at the forward landfill 
the district attorney contends that the alleged violations constitute unfair business practices under the california business and professions code section  et seq  by virtue of violations of public resources code division  part  chapter  article  sections and b  california code of regulations title  chapter  subchapter  article  sections and  and health and safety code sections   et seq  and  et seq 
although the complaint is worded very broadly and does not identify specific permit or regulatory violations  the district attorney has articulated three primary concerns in past communications  alleging that the landfill used green waste containing food as alternative daily cover  exceeded its daily solid waste tonnage receipt limitations under its solid waste facility permit  and received hazardous waste in violation of its permit ie  auto shredder waste 
additionally  it is alleged that the landfill allowed a concentration of methane gas in excess of five percent 
discovery is currently underway 
we are vigorously defending against the allegations 
on february   the us environmental protection agency epa region ix delivered a finding and notice of violation to the forward landfill as a result of alleged violations of the title v permit issued under the clean air act 
the facility is jointly regulated by the epa and the san joaquin valley air pollution control district

on july   klingler s european bake shop deli  inc  filed a complaint against the company and one of its subsidiaries in the circuit court of jefferson county  alabama  in which plaintiff complains about fuel environmental recovery fees and administrative fees charged by the company or one of its subsidiaries 
the cln properties maevers complaint  which the plaintiffs amended on august   purports to be filed on behalf of a nationwide class of similarly situated plaintiffs  while the klingler s complaint purports to be filed on behalf of a class of similarly situated plaintiffs in alabama 
each complaint asserts various legal and equitable theories of recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were not properly disclosed  were unfair  and were contrary to contract 
we filed motions to dismiss in both actions 
on january   the court in the cln maevers case granted our motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part 
plaintiff in the klingler s case voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice on october  and subsequently re filed a virtually identical complaint against a different subsidiary of the company on november  we recently moved to dismiss this new complaint

the court entered the hold separate stipulation and order on december   which terminated the waiting period under the hsr act and allowed the parties to close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the hold separate stipulation and order 
these conditions include the divestiture of certain assets which were completed by september  however  the final judgment can only be approved by the court after the doj publishes a notice in the federal register and considers comments it receives 
during this period  if the doj believes that the final judgment is no longer in the public interest  the doj may withdraw its support of the final judgment and seek to prevent the final judgment from becoming final in its present form 
likewise  the court may  in its discretion  modify the divestitures or other relief sought by the doj if the court believes that such modification is in the public interest 
on july   the doj and the seven state attorneys general filed a motion seeking entry of the proposed final judgment 
the precise timing for the confirmation of the final judgment is not known 
management believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that modifications to the final judgment  if any  will not be material 
proxy disclosure matter in late  a republic stockholder brought a lawsuit in federal court in delaware challenging our disclosures in our proxy statement with respect to the executive incentive plan eip that was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting 
the lawsuit is styled as a combined proxy disclosure claim and derivative action 
we are a defendant only with respect to the proxy disclosure claim  which seeks only to require us to make additional disclosures regarding the eip and to hold a new stockholder vote prior to making any payments under the eip 
the derivative claim is purportedly brought on behalf of our company against all of our directors and the individuals who were executive officers at the time of the annual meeting and alleges  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty 
that claim also seeks injunctive relief and seeks to recoup on behalf of our company an unspecified amount of the incentive compensation that may be 
table of contents paid to our executives under the eip  as well as the amount of any tax deductions that may be lost if the eip does not comply with section m of the internal revenue code

contracting matter we recently discovered actions of non compliance by one of our subsidiaries with the subcontracting provisions of certain government contracts in one of our markets 
we reported the discovery to  and expect further discussions with  law enforcement authorities 
such non compliance could result in payments by us in the form of restitution  damages  or penalties  or the loss of future business 
based on the information currently available to us  including our expectation that our self disclosure will be viewed favorably by the applicable authorities  we presently believe that the resolution of the matter  while it may have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which it is recognized or paid  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position

table of contents tax matters we and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the us and puerto rico  as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions 
we have acquired allied s open tax periods as part of the acquisition 
allied is currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through prior to the merger  the irs had commenced an examination of our through tax years and this exam is currently ongoing 
in  the irs opened an examination of our tax year

risk management companies prior to allied s acquisition of browning ferris industries bfi in july  certain bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 
on january   the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
in april  the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction with respect to bfi tax years prior to the acquisition 
in july  allied filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims cfc relating to the bfi tax years 
in january  we paid all tax  interest and penalty asserted by the irs with respect to the bfi tax years and withdrew our suit for refund in the cfc 
in august  allied received from the irs a statutory notice of deficiency related to its utilization of bfi s capital loss carryforward on allied s tax return 
in october  allied filed a suit for refund in federal district court in arizona with respect to allied s tax year 
in december  we reached a settlement with both the doj and irs for allied s tax year and all subsequent tax years 
under the settlement  the company resolved all remaining liability for this matter including federal and state tax  penalty and interest for approximately million 
we paid approximately million in the first quarter of and expect to pay the remainder  approximately million  later in while the final settlement amount is less than the amount previously accrued for this matter  the accrual and the adjustment thereto are reflected in our allocation of purchase price associated with the acquisition of allied and had no impact on our consolidated statement of income 
exchange of partnership interests in april  allied exchanged minority partnership interests in four waste to energy facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment purchasing businesses  which are now wholly owned subsidiaries 
in november  the irs issued a formal disallowance to allied contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a corresponding gain should have been recognized 
we believe our position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter 
although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter  if the exchange is treated as a sale  we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million 
in addition  the irs has asserted a penalty of of the additional income tax due 
the potential tax and interest but not penalty or penalty related interest of a full adjustment for this matter have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet at december  the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penalty related interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents methane gas as part of its examination of allied s through federal income tax returns  the irs reviewed allied s treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations 
as a result of this review  the irs has proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill 
the irs position is that the methane gas produced by a landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the landfill and  therefore  these costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed 
we have protested this matter to the appeals office of the irs 
we believe we have several meritorious defenses  including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services 
therefore  we believe that the subsequent resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item a 
risk factors 
overview of our business we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry  as measured by revenue 
we provide non hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states and puerto rico 
we own or operate transfer stations  active solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we also operate landfill gas and renewable energy projects 
we completed our merger with allied waste industries  inc allied in december we believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 
despite the challenging economic environment  our business performed well during due in large part to the indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our business 
revenue for the year ended december  increased by to billion compared to billion during the comparable period in this increase in revenue is attributable to our merger with allied 
assuming our merger with allied occurred on january   and the revenue associated with the related divestitures is eliminated in the period the assets were sold along with the comparable prior year period  core revenue for the year ended december  would have decreased consisting of a increase in core price offset by decreases of in core volume  in fuel charges and in commodity price 
the core price increase  together with cost control steps taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes  served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising costs and declining revenue resulting from decreases in service volumes 
business initiatives we expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the latter part of and all of will extend into we anticipate continued year over year decreases in volumes in all lines of our business 
however  we believe that we will continue to benefit from our cost control and pricing initiatives 
our business is capital intensive 
slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending  thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy 
in addition  our attention is focused on completing the integration of our newly merged company  achieving cost synergies and pursuing other revenue enhancing and cost reduction opportunities 

table of contents our business initiatives for focus on completing the integration of our operations with allied s  while remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have made us successful 
our initiatives include safety 
safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees 
republic has a long standing commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for our employees 
our commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident in our mission statement 
we will continue to foster a safe work environment for our employees and the communities that we service 
in addition  we will continue to reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner 
service delivery 
we believe that our focus on service delivery differentiates us from others in the waste management industry 
during  we will continue to exceed our customers expectations through the consistent delivery of high quality service 
we will also focus on increasing the efficiency of our service delivery 
we believe that our attention to efficient delivery of high quality customer service will enhance customer retention 
synergy capture 
prior to the effective date of our merger with allied  we identified million of annual run rate integration synergies 
we also developed a detailed plan for realizing this goal that includes participation at all levels throughout the company from the drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of directors 
this plan anticipated achieving million of annual run rate integration synergies by the end of fiscal as of december   we have already met our original goal of million of run rate synergies and have increased our total goal for annual run rate synergies to to million 
we expect to achieve this goal by the end of we also expect to spend approximately million in one time costs during directly attributable to achieving our synergy goal 
other opportunities 
with our synergy goals well within our reach  during we intend to redirect our attention to other opportunities that were identified during our synergy planning discussions  but were assigned a lower priority 
these opportunities include enhancing pricing systems and return on investment models  standardizing prospecting  sales reporting and disposal optimization tools  standardizing repair and maintenance procedures  developing a new operating platform for our national accounts program to ensure customer satisfaction  and consolidating and standardizing our customer call centers 
we believe that these initiatives will provide our company with substantial earnings benefit when they are fully implemented 
return on invested capital 
enhancing our return on invested capital is the culmination of all our initiatives 
we will maintain our focus on disciplined growth and investing in our business to ensure increasing returns on invested capital and shareholder value 
recent developments in the first quarter of  we notified the registered holders of our senior notes due the senior notes that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in march the senior notes will be redeemed at a price equal to of the principal amount  of which million is outstanding  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we expect to incur a charge upon extinguishment of the senior notes of approximately million 
we expect this charge will be reflected in our first quarter financial results 
in the fourth quarter of  we notified the registered holders of our senior notes due  our senior subordinated convertible debentures due and our senior notes due that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in november and december of the senior notes due were redeemed at  the senior subordinated convertible debentures due were redeemed at par and the senior notes due were redeemed at

additionally  in september  we purchased and retired million of our outstanding senior notes maturing in and resulting in a third quarter loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
for the year ended december   total loss on extinguishment of debt was million 

table of contents the repayment of the senior notes was primarily funded by the issuance of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due in two separate private placement transactions 
the notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our parent company 
the notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our credit facilities 
these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  we entered into a registration rights agreements with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the notes 
under the registration rights agreements  we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us 
if we are unable to effect the exchange offer within days  we agreed to pay additional interest on the notes 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 
business acquisitions and divestitures we make decisions to acquire  invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
merger with allied waste industries  inc on december   we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of allied in a stock for stock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of billion  which included approximately billion of debt  at fair value

costs to achieve synergies 
during and the fourth quarter of  we incurred million and million  respectively  of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plans

remediation recoveries charges 
during  we recovered million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at our countywide facility  which were partially offset by additional charges of million at our closed disposal facility in california 
remediation and related charges of million during were attributable to changes to our cost estimates at our countywide facility  our closed disposal facility in california  and the sunrise landfill in nevada 
tax effect of permanent items in adjustments

landfill amortization 
during  we recorded million of incremental landfill amortization expense as compared to the amortization expense allied would have recorded for the same period 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted pre tax income  adjusted net income attributable to republic services  inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share  which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap  provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items 
we use these measures  and believe investors will find them helpful  in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period 
comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods  and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods 
our definition of adjusted pre tax income  adjusted net income attributable to republic services  inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies

our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal and recycling 
our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index 
we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our transfer station  landfill and to a lesser extent our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of recycled materials and revenue from national accounts acquired from allied 
national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  and  as such  the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations

we completed the reorganization of our operating segments related to our acquisition of allied in the first quarter of  and are providing internal and external reporting in accordance with our reorganized structure 
significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing with and comparing with are discussed in the following paragraphs 
the increase in aggregate dollars for revenue  depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion  and operating income loss for each of our reportable segments is due to our acquisition of allied 
the results of our reportable segments were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and liabilities  as required by the doj 
where the effect was significant  we have noted our operating margin exclusive of these gains and losses 
additionally  the decrease in revenue resulting from declines in volumes and commodity prices noted below are attributable to the economic slowdown 
compared to eastern region 
revenue for the year ended december  benefited from core price growth in all lines of business 
however  the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume 
table of contents declines in all lines of business  especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business 
we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 
in  we realized a million net gain from the disposition of assets  which increased operating margins by 
we also recovered million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at our countywide facility in ohio  which increased operating margins by 
in  we incurred a million charge for environmental conditions at our countywide facility  which reduced our operating margin for the year ended december  by 
we incurred a million charge related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon negotiations with the oepa and epa  which reduced our operating margin by 
we also incurred million in legal settlement costs  which decreased operating margins by 
the remaining increase in operating margins is attributed to lower fuel  disposal  and selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher labor and facilities expense

revenue for the year ended december  benefited from core price growth in all lines of business 
however  the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of business  especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business 
we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 
for the year ended december   we realized gains from the disposition of assets of million  which increased operating margins by 
partially offsetting these gains was an unfavorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of million  reducing operating margin by  and remediation charges totaling million  reducing operating margin by related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california 
in addition  lower landfill revenue which has higher margins than our collection line of business negatively impacted margins 
in the second quarter of  we incurred a million charge at the sunrise landfill and a million charge at our closed disposal facility in california for environmental conditions at each of these locations 
the charges reduced operating margin by 
margins were favorably impacted by lower labor  fuel  transportation and selling  general and administrative expenses  offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense

the increase in net revenue relates to allied s national accounts program 
the increase in depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion expense  and the increase in the operating loss are attributable to the acquisition of allied

compared to eastern region 
revenue in our eastern region increased during compared to due to the addition of operating results for allied from the date of the acquisition which was effective december  the increase in revenue is also due to price increases in all lines of business 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in volumes in all lines of business and a decrease in the prices of commodities 
the decrease in volume is primarily attributable to less temporary work and lower transfer station volumes due to less construction activity 
the operating loss in includes remediation charges of million related to estimated costs to comply with the f os issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa related to our countywide facility and an impairment charge of million related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon negotiations with the oepa and epa

southern region 
the acquisition of allied and price increases in all lines of business resulted in an increase in revenue during compared to this increase in revenue was partially offset by volume declines in our industrial collection line of business and at our landfills

included in our gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments  net for the year 
table of contents ended december  is a million charge for the asset impairment associated with our former corporate office in florida 
landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site  including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 
available airspace the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december   and balance landfills permits changes balance as of new acquired  granted  in as of december  expansions net of net of airspace engineering december  undertaken divestitures closures consumed estimates cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
as of december   we owned or operated active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further information 
during  total available airspace decreased by a net million cubic yards primarily due to divestitures  closures and airspace consumed  partially offset by new expansions 
during  total available airspace increased by a net billion cubic yards due to the merger with allied in december  which contributed active landfills representing billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace 
excluding the merger with allied  total available airspace related to republic s pre merger operations decreased by a net billion cubic yards  primarily due to airspace consumed  changes in engineering estimates and changes in design 
the decrease during due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at our countywide facility 

table of contents during  total available airspace increased by a net million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken  changes in engineering estimates and permits granted  partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design 
in addition  total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas  which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas 
changes in design in are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills 
between december  and december   we received permits for twelve of our probable expansions  which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 
as of december   twelve of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity  eight of which were added as a result of our acquisition of allied 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december  number of number of sites sites without with percent expansion expansion total of airspace airspace sites total to years to years to years to years years total final capping  closure and post closure costs as of december   accrued final capping  closure and post closure costs were  million  of which million is current and million is long term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 
remediation and other charges for landfill matters in december  we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the acquisition of allied 
these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied  or a predecessor company that it had acquired  had been identified as a potentially responsible party 
the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies environmental remediation liabilities  for further information 
we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 
discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 

table of contents the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters countywide landfill 
in  we were issued final findings and orders f os by the ohio environmental protection agency oepa related to environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide in east sparta  ohio and we agreed to undertake certain other remedial actions with the oepa as well 
during  republic services of ohio ii  llc republic ohio  an ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of countywide  entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republic ohio to perform certain remediation activities at countywide 
republic ohio also has completed construction of an isolation break under the authority and supervision of the us epa 
on september   republic ohio entered into a set of f os with the oepa that supersede previous f os mentioned above 
the f os require the implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance program for managing the remediation area 
the operation and maintenance program requires republic ohio to maintain the temporary cap and other engineering controls to prevent odors and isolate and contain the reaction 
the operation and maintenance program also requires the installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when conditions become conducive to such installation  and is ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure of the acre remediation area at countywide 
the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december  is million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid during west contra costa county landfill 
in  we were issued an enforcement order by the california department of toxic substance control dtsc for the class hazardous waste cell at the west contra costa county landfill west county 
subsequently  we entered into a consent agreement with dtsc in at which time we agreed to undertake certain remedial actions 
the remediation liability for west county recorded as of december  is million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid during sunrise landfill 
on august   republic services of southern nevada rssn  our wholly owned subsidiary  signed a consent decree with the epa  the bureau of land management and clark county  nevada related to the sunrise landfill 
under the consent decree  rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county were otherwise jointly and severally liable 
rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree 
however  we have not recorded any potential recoveries 
the remediation liability for sunrise recorded as of december  is million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid during congress development landfill 
in january  congress development co 
cdc was issued an agreed preliminary injunction and order by the circuit court of illinois  cook county 
subsequently  the court issued two additional supplemental orders that required cdc to implement certain remedial actions at the congress landfill 
the remediation liability recorded for cdc as of december  is million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid during it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information  to the extent that such information impacts the costs  timing or duration of the required actions 
future changes in our estimates of the costs  timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

our net income increased by million  on a year over year basis  primarily due to the acquisition of allied in december  which positively affected our cash flow from operations in changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures 
changes in assets and liabilities negatively affected our cash flow from operations by million in versus a negative impact of million in  primarily as a result of the following during  the cash we paid to settle our capping  closure  post closure and remediation obligations increased by million 
the increase in cash paid for closure and post closure activities is primarily due to our acquisition of allied 
during  we paid million for restructuring and synergy related costs incurred in connection with the restructuring plan formulated as a result of our acquisition of allied 
the plan included closing our corporate office in florida  consolidating administrative functions to arizona  the former headquarters of allied  and reducing staffing levels 
during  we made income tax payments net of refunds received of approximately million  of which approximately million relates to taxes on our divestitures 
during  we made income tax payments net of refunds received of approximately million 
during  approximately million of federal tax payments were deferred and paid in as a result of the merger with allied 
with respect to the settlement of certain tax liabilities regarding our risk management companies  we paid approximately million in the first quarter of and expect to pay the remainder  approximately million  later in cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business  the timing of payments received for accounts receivable  and the timing of payments made for accounts payable and federal income taxes

proceeds from divestitures 
proceeds from divestitures net of cash divested and other sales of assets were million in  million in and million in proceeds from divestitures in were the result of divestitures of certain assets as required by the doj as a condition of the merger with allied and certain other business dispositions 
proceeds from divestitures in related primarily to the disposition of our compost  mulch and soil business in texas 
change in restricted cash and marketable securities 
changes in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances  which are largely related to the issuance of tax exempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance  contributed million to our investing activities in compared to uses of cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the funds received from issuances of tax exempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance 
as we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes  they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
proceeds from bond issuances represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
during  our reimbursements from restricted cash accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of tax exempt bonds 
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand  restricted cash held for capital expenditures  cash flows from operations  our revolving credit facilities  and tax exempt bonds and other financings 
we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows from financing activities for the periods presented are summarized below net debt repayments or borrowings 
payments of notes payable and long term debt net of proceeds from notes payable and long term debt and issuance of senior notes were million in versus net borrowing of million and million in and  respectively 
during  we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due the primary use of proceeds from the notes together with draws on our credit facilities was to purchase and retire i million of varied senior notes maturing in and pursuant to our september tender offer  ii million of of senior notes due  iii million of senior notes due  iv million of senior subordinated convertible debentures due and  v repurchase certain of our senior notes maturing in and in the secondary market 
additionally  our senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of matured during we repaid the remaining principal balance of million in may net borrowings reflected in our cash flows provided by financing activities in were primarily related to the merger with allied 
we used proceeds from our revolver to refinance extensions of credit under allied s senior credit facility  to pay 
table of contents fees and expenses in connection therewith  and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger 
premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior notes 
in connection with the issuance of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in  we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling million 
purchase of common stock for treasury 
from through  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock 
as of december   we had paid billion to repurchase million shares of our common stock  of which million was paid during to repurchase million shares and million was paid during to repurchase million shares of our common stock 
the stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of due to the pending merger with allied 
we expect that the share repurchase program will continue to be suspended until at least cash dividends paid 
we initiated a quarterly cash dividend in july the dividend has been increased each year thereafter  with the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of our current quarterly dividend per share is 
dividends paid were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

in april  we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility from million to billion and extended the term from to in conjunction with the merger with allied  in september  we entered into an additional billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility was used initially at the time of the merger to refinance extensions of credit under allied s senior credit facility  to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith  and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger 
we also amended our existing billion credit facility to conform certain terms of the facility to those included in our new billion credit facility 
we did not change the maturity date of the billion credit facility 
the billion revolving credit facility due april and the billion revolving credit facility due september collectively  credit facilities bear interest at a base rate  or a eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 
as of december  and  the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was and  respectively 
our credit facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments  regardless of usage

we had billion and billion of eurodollar rate borrowings  and billion and billion of letters of credit utilizing availability under our credit facilities  leaving billion and billion of availability under our credit facilities at december  and  respectively 
the agreements governing the credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
we have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants 
compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity 
at december   our ebitda to interest ratio was compared to the minimum required by the covenants

in november  we issued million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of due in a private placement transaction 
the notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on november  interest is payable semi annually on may and november  beginning may  these senior notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our credit facilities 
these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes

also during  we completed the required divestitures under the consent decree with the doj 
proceeds from the sales of the divested assets were primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 
additionally  our senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of matured during we repaid the remaining principal balance of million in may in the first quarter of we called million of our senior notes due we expect to incur a loss upon extinguishment of the debt of approximately million

this restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to repay debt  which may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity date using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 
credit rating we have received investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   our senior debt was rated bbb  baa  and bbb by standard poor s rating services  inc  moody s investors service  inc 
and fitch  inc  respectively 
fuel hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices 
we have entered into multiple swap agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
the swaps qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges 
we have the following fuel hedges outstanding at december  and notional amount in gallons contract price inception date commencement date termination date per month per gallon january  january  december   january  january  december   november  january  december   march  january  december   march  january  december   september  january  december   july  january  december   july  january  december   july  january  december   if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price as published by the department of energy exceeds the contract price per gallon  we receive the difference between the average 
table of contents price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counter party 
if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counter party 
the fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third party counter parties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level in the fair value hierarchy 
the aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at december  and were current assets of million and million  respectively  and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december  and  net of tax  of million and million  respectively  have been recorded in stockholders equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income

realized losses gains of million  million and million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
commodity hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities 
we have entered into multiple agreements related to certain forecasted commodity sales 
the swaps qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales commodity hedges

if the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton  we pay the difference to the counter party 
the fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from third party counter parties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level in the fair value hierarchy 
the aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges at december  and were current assets of million and million  respectively  and current liabilities of million and nil  respectively  and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december  and  net of tax  of million and million have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions maturities of notes payable  capital leases final capping  unconditional year ending operating and other long closure and purchase december  leases term debt post closure remediation commitments total thereafter total the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated remaining final capping  closure and post closure expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december  unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments  host agreements and take or pay and put or pay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 
in addition to the above  we have unrecognized tax benefits at december  of million  of which we expect to settle approximately million to million within the next twelve months 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 
we also have letters of credit of billion  of which billion utilize availability under our credit facilities at december  debt covenants our credit facilities contain financial covenants 
we have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities 
we were also in compliance with the non financial covenants of the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during on december   we received the requisite consents for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt securities of allied waste north america  inc awna 
the amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing reporting obligations required of allied 
under the amended supplemental indentures  the ongoing reporting obligations may be satisfied by republic 
the collateral that had secured the awna senior notes and the bfi debentures equally and ratably with the allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of the merger with allied and the repayment of that facility 

table of contents failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements 
this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes  and  therefore  our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
financial assurance we are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurance required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow 
table of contents for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow  you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere herein 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the period the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
contingencies for a description of our contingencies  see note  income taxes  and note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas 
residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 
accounting for the acquisition of allied acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition  with the 
table of contents excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill 
the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition  and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business 
these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed  or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 
we have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of allied 
adjustments  if any  to our estimates of fair values and the resulting purchase price allocation in future periods will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment  other intangible assets  landfill asset retirement obligations  legal and environmental reserves  self insurance reserves  income taxes  other non current assets and long term obligations  and assets held for sale 
our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december   a portion of which will be paid in future periods 
residual risks the residual risks identified below related to critical accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair value estimation processes for acquisitions 
for discussion of other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for acquisitions  see item a 
risk factors 
landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories  each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 
landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping  closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 
landfill development costs we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are also capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
site permits 
in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal levels 
the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 
studies performed could be inaccurate  which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit 
denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 

table of contents actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain  maintain or expand permits could result in denial  revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project  which could result in an asset impairment 
technical landfill design 
upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
the technical designs  which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill  including the types and quantities of materials that will be required  are reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs  difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity 
included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  such as the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste 
development costs 
the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 

table of contents landfill development asset amortization 
in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill s operating life 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 
on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill asset retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure 
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
landfill capping 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 
closure and post closure 
closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate  and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
the initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time 
during  we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding our remediation sites  and as a result increased the fair value of our closure and post closure reserves by million 
any further adjustments to our reserves 
table of contents resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods in which such adjustments become known 
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets 
estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in 
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities 
this accretion expense is charged to operating expenses 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care  could cause changes in our cost estimates 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 
on an annual basis  we update our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets 
changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
in connection with the annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations  we made a change in estimate  which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle 
this change  which we believe is preferable  was made to better 
table of contents align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills 
the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event 
this change resulted in a million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets 
these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate 
this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
permitted and probable disposal capacity 
as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement  we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  progress is being made on the project  the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and we believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced  which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business 
under current laws and regulations  we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate  including sites that we have acquired  or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste 
our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater  surface water and soil contamination  as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs 
to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites  we evaluate several factors  including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site  the required remediation methods  the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
table of contents in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies 
we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known 
adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 
we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 
the environmental liabilities assumed from allied relate to impacts at both owned and unowned sites 
in the case of owned sites  we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory entity under the applicable regulations typically rcra or cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues 
at unowned sites  we are working within the regulatory and procedural framework established by cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues  in conjunction with other potentially liable parties at each location 
pursuant to the purchase method of accounting  we have recorded the environmental remediation liabilities assumed from allied based upon estimates of their fair value  using an estimate of future cash flows or settlement 
previously  and consistent with our method of accounting  allied recorded remediation liabilities based upon accounting for loss contingencies  however  amounts recorded under this method are generally not at fair value 
since the date of acquisition  our process for deriving fair value for the environmental liabilities assumed from allied included first identifying the population of remediation sites where we are either fully or partially responsible for remediation or potential remediation 
the population of remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on i the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages in the applicable regulation typically cercla or rcra and ii the extent of our participation in the remediation activity 
using these categories  we applied one of the following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value for sites with established responsibility but a high level of uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process  we developed multiple remediation scenarios 
we then probability weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value estimate 
for sites where the level of responsibility was less defined  we developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel 
for sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the remedial process  we identified the most applicable standard remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of each technique to develop a fair value estimate 
for the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty  we developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to determine the fair value of the liability 
the initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time 
during  we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding allied s remediation sites 
in certain situations  we used external engineers and attorneys to assist in the development of our fair value estimates 
as a result of the process  we increased the fair value of our remediation reserves by million 
any further adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known 
residual risks we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities 
our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain 
consequently  our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination  the required remediation methods  the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified  the financial viability of those parties  and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 

table of contents an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income 
self insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverage  ranging from million to million 
residual risks incident rates  including frequency and severity  and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change  which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 
it is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
residual risks actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons  including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
asset impairment valuation methodology 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 
residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 

table of contents evaluation criteria 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill which is discussed below relates to our landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments  revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit  or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity  could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill recoverability we annually test goodwill at december for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern  midwest  southern  and western 
in determining fair value  we primarily utilize discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 
significant estimates used in our fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include  but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit  which we estimate to range from to  ii future estimated effective tax rates  which we estimate to be  iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital  iv estimated discount rates  which we estimate to range between and  and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit  which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but are not limited to i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit  ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay  and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
in addition  we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests  indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold  iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit  v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value  or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 
we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit s fair value 
in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december   we determined that the aggregate sum of our reporting unit fair values exceeded our market capitalization 
we determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market price on december  we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between fair value and our market capitalization is due to a 
table of contents control premium 
we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control  and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 
as of december   we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units by a range of to and  as such  we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 
we will continuously monitor market trends in our business  the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment 
if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment  we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis  which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill 
additionally  we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment 
our operating segments  which also represent our reporting units  are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses 
when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested  goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 
residual risks future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values  which could trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted new guidance which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this new guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
this new guidance also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  and accounting in interim periods 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents residual risks income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters 
such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings  unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill 
changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan  the bfi retirement plan the plan 
the plan covers certain employees in the united states  including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the plan s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied s acquisition of bfi in our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of and irc  as amended by the pension protection act of no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are required for the plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds  equity funds and cash 
we annually review and adjust the plan s asset allocation as deemed necessary 
residual risk changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
assumptions 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates  expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases 
our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 
we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability 
if the discount rate increases by  our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately million 
if 
table of contents the discount rate were to decrease by  our benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the plan assets  giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
less than of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits 
residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 
our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return 
new accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and  accordingly  approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities 
the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 
the table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement

fuel price risk fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renewal contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in 
table of contents an increase in our cost of operations  a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage  because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our cost of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenue and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities 
as a result  changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations 
revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively
