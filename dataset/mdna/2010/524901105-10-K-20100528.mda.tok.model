table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview legg mason  inc  a holding company  with its subsidiaries which collectively comprise legg mason is a global asset management firm 
acting through our subsidiaries  we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients  company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles 
we offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries 
we have operations principally in the united states of america and the united kingdom and also have offices in australia  bahamas  brazil  canada  chile  china  dubai  france  germany  italy  japan  luxembourg  poland  singapore  spain and taiwan 
we operate in one reportable business segment  asset management 
we manage our business in two divisions or operating segments  americas and international  which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage 
our division management reports directly to our chief executive officer 
the americas division consists of our us domiciled fund families  the separate account businesses of our us based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization 
similarly  the international division consists of our fund complexes  distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the us we believe this structure provides greater focus and allows us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad 
our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees  from separate accounts and funds  and distribution and service fees 
investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage 
in addition  performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios  and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio 
our revenues  therefore  are dependent upon the level of our assets under management  and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions  our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel  and investment performance 
our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance 
client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management  and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services  may be based on one or more of a number of factors 
these factors include our reputation in the marketplace  the investment performance  both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products  of our products and services  the fees we charge for our investment services  the client or potential client s situation  including investment objectives  liquidity needs  investment horizon and amount of assets managed  our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment  including market conditions 
the fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management  and the type of services and investment objectives that are provided 
fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services 
accordingly  our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we may reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
as such  our net income attributable to legg mason  inc  operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues  and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
the most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits  of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits 
the next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees  which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset 
table of contents management products and services and are largely variable in nature 
certain other operating costs are fixed in nature  such as occupancy  depreciation and amortization  and fixed contract commitments for market data  communication and technology services  and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or  conversely  usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity 
our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states  but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the amount and composition of our assets under management  and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  among other things 
sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely 
in addition  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance  access to distribution channels  reputation in the market  attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients 
the recent economic downturn contributed to a significant contraction in our business  although we have experienced improvement over the past year 
the financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive 
our competition includes numerous global  national  regional and local asset management firms  broker dealers and commercial banks 
the industry has been dramatically impacted by the recent economic downturn  and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  the fixed income markets endured substantial turmoil 
one effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles sivs became substantially reduced 
as a result  and to protect our clients  we entered into several arrangements during fiscal and to provide support to liquidity funds  managed by a subsidiary  that had invested in siv securities 
there were no arrangements remaining as of march  the industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal  state  and foreign laws 
like most firms  we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes 
responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability 
all references to fiscal  or refer to our fiscal year ended march of that year 
terms such as we  us  our  and company refer to legg mason 
business environment and results of operations the financial environment globally and in the united states rebounded during fiscal  but challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform and mixed economic data 
the equity markets increased due to steady improvement in consumer confidence  stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates  and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors 
during fiscal  the federal reserve board held the discount rate at  the lowest in history 
our results were positively impacted by many of these factors and the cost saving measures that began last fiscal year 
the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal we cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the company s results

aum at march  were billion  an increase of billion or from march  the increase in aum was attributable to market appreciation of billion  of which approximately resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation  which was partially offset by net client outflows of billion 
the majority of outflows were in fixed income with billion  or of the outflows  followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of billion and billion  respectively 
the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset management company western asset and brandywine global investment management  llc brandywine that had experienced past investment underperformance  although their performance improved significantly during fiscal we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at clearbridge advisors llc clearbridge  batterymarch financial management  inc batterymarch  the permal group  ltd 
permal and legg mason capital management  inc lmcm 
due in part to investment performance issues  we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal  although recent performance improved significantly during fiscal and the rate of outflows in this asset class has generally been lower in recent quarters 
we generally earn higher fees and profits on equity aum  and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes 
our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice  and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in our reputation in the marketplace  changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships  loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance

revenue by division operating revenues by division in millions for the years ended march were as follows of total of total change americas international total the decrease in operating revenues in the americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by western asset  lmcm  and clearbridge  decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by western asset and clearbridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from us retail equity funds 
the decrease in operating revenues in the international division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at permal 
results of operations operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march  were billion  down from billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum 
the shift in the mix of average aum from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to million 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets at clearbridge  private capital management  lp pcm  lmcm and brandywine  and million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset

table of contents investment advisory fees from funds decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at permal  lmcm  and clearbridge  million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by western asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors  and million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at western asset 
performance fees increased  or million  to million during fiscal  driven by fees earned on assets managed at western asset and permal 
distribution and service fees decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund aum and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by western asset 
operating expenses as a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal due to challenging market conditions  actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure 
these cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions  significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects  and substantial curtailment of promotional costs 
operating expenses in fiscal continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal  with many of the more significant actions implemented in the december quarter 
the discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal and  where applicable 
compensation and benefits decreased to billion 
this decrease was driven by a million decrease in revenue share based compensation  primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal  the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates 
the net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately million 
these reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  which are offset by gains in other non operating income expense 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a million reduction in technology consulting fees  telecommunications and market data services 
reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense  which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal  of million and million  respectively  also contributed to the decrease 
occupancy expense decreased to million  primarily due to the recognition of million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year  offset in part by a million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal amortization of intangible assets decreased to million  primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal  which reduced amortization expense by million 
impairment charges were billion in fiscal approximately billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former wealth management division as a result of significant declines in the aum and projected cash flows within that division 
the remaining million related to certain acquired management contracts  as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition  and the impairment of a trade name 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charges 
other expenses decreased million to million  primarily as a result of cost savings 
table of contents initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of million  and advertising costs of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors 
in may  we announced a plan to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates where they are closer to the actual client relationships and can be delivered with greater effectiveness  and our americas distribution group sharing in revenue on retail based aum growth 
this plan involves headcount reductions in operations  technology and other administrative areas at the corporate location  which may be partially offset by headcount increases at the affiliates  and will ultimately enable us to eliminate a portion of our corporate office space that was dedicated to our operations and technology employees 
we project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately to million  and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal the initiative is projected to involve restructuring and transition related costs that will primarily include transition payments to affiliates primarily compensation to temporarily offset the cost of absorbing the services  charges for severance and retention incentives  and may also include costs for early contract terminations and asset disposals 
the total expected costs are in the range of to million and will be incurred over the next two fiscal years 
however  the achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements  as well as the amount of restructuring and transition related costs  will be subject to many factors  including market conditions and other factors affecting the financial results of the company and our affiliates and the rate of aum growth 
in addition  our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business 
non operating income expense interest income decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances  which reduced interest income by million and million  respectively 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the exchange of our equity units in august  which reduced interest expense by million  and a million decrease due to the repayment of million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march  the repayment of our senior notes in july  the repayment of the million outstanding balance on our million term loan in january  as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in amortization of debt issuance costs  primarily related to the early repayment of our million term loan 
due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds  in fiscal we reversed unrealized  non cash losses recorded in fiscal of million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve sivs 
during fiscal  fund support losses were billion  primarily as a result of siv price deterioration and our elimination of siv exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on fund support 
other non operating income expense increased million to income of million  primarily as a result of an increase of million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above  and million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products  which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our equity units in fiscal income tax benefit the provision for income taxes was million compared to a benefit of billion in the prior year  primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges 
the effective tax rate was compared to a benefit rate of in the prior year 
the current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
the prior year s benefit rate was driven by the impact of the siv related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge  offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary 

table of contents supplemental non gaap financial information as supplemental information  we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap for cash income  cash income  as adjusted  and operating margin  as adjusted that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of legg mason  inc and its subsidiaries 
cash income loss  as adjusted we define cash income as net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill  and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
we define cash income  as adjusted as cash income plus less net money market fund support losses gains and impairment charges less net losses on the sale of the underlying siv securities 
we believe that cash income and cash income  as adjusted  provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items as indicators of value that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions  issued contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions  including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments 
we also believe that cash income and cash income  as adjusted  are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business 
these measures are provided in addition to net income  but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of cash earnings or cash income  of other companies 
further  cash income and cash income  as adjusted  are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under gaap 
legg mason considers cash income and cash income  as adjusted  to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies  as indicators of value that facilitate comparisons of legg mason s operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions  significant acquisitions  or issued contingent convertible debt 
in calculating cash income  we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  such as management contracts  to net income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of legg mason s operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under gaap absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business 
because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangibles and goodwill over time  we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income 
conversely  we subtract the realized income tax benefits on impairment charges that have been recognized under gaap 
we also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt  which is a non cash expense  as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under gaap 
in calculating cash income  as adjusted  we add subtract net money market fund support losses gains net of losses on the sale of the underlying siv securities  if applicable and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of legg mason s operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions  including any related impairments 
should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangibles or goodwill occur  its impact on cash income and cash income  as adjusted  may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm 
also  realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm 
accordingly  we monitor these items and their related impact  including taxes  on cash income and cash income  as adjusted  to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures 
although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses  we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income  as adjusted  because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement 

table of contents a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc to cash income loss  as adjusted in thousands except per share amounts is as follows for the years ended march  net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc plus less amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets deferred income taxes on impairment charges imputed interest on convertible debt cash income loss plus less net money market fund support gains losses impairment charges net loss on sale of siv securities cash income loss  as adjusted net income loss per diluted share attributable to legg mason  inc common shareholders plus less amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets deferred income taxes on impairment charges imputed interest on convertible debt cash income loss per diluted share plus less net money market fund support gains losses impairment charges net loss on sale of siv securities cash income loss per diluted share  as adjusted includes related adjustments to operating expenses  if applicable  and income tax provision benefit 
the increase in cash income loss  as adjusted  was primarily due to the impact of net realized losses of billion on the sale of siv securities in the prior fiscal year 
operating margin  as adjusted we calculate operating margin  as adjusted  by dividing i operating income  adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans  the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements and  impairment charges by ii our operating revenues less distribution and servicing expenses that are passed through to third party distributors  which we refer to as adjusted operating revenues 
the compensation items are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in other non operating income expense  and thus have no impact on net income 
we use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products 
legg mason believes that operating margin  as adjusted  is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what legg mason s operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our 
table of contents products 
this measure is provided in addition to the company s operating margin calculated under gaap  but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under gaap and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted margins  of other companies

the majority of these siv securities were supported under capital support arrangements  letters of credit or a total return swap trs prior to the purchase 
these transactions  along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than sivs  resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of billion 
also  during fiscal  impairment charges of billion were recorded  related to goodwill and intangible assets  primarily in our former wealth management division  as a result of declines in the aum and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division  and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name

the markets were significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions  the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention

in the fixed income markets  the economic crisis deepened  but the government s numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery  causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the march quarter 
the fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy  and the government s intention to issue more public debt for financing  caused yields to rise during the quarter 
for the year period  treasury yields decreased significantly while long term rates increased resulting in a steeper yield curve

table of contents revenue by division operating revenues by division in millions for the years ended march were as follows of total of total change americas international total the decrease in operating revenues in the americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by lmcm  clearbridge  and royce  decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by pcm  clearbridge and lmcm  and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from us retail equity funds 
the decrease in operating revenues in the international division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at permal  lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by western asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from international balanced and fixed income funds 
results of operations operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march  were billion  down from billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an decrease in average aum  due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately and fixed income assets of approximately 
the shift in the mix of aum from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline 
operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately million  or 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets at pcm  clearbridge  lmcm and brandywine  million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset  and million was the result of the sale of the legg mason private portfolio group lmppg business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the sale 
investment advisory fees from funds decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  approximately million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at lmcm  clearbridge  permal  and royce  approximately million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset  offset by approximately million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed  primarily at western asset 
performance fees decreased  or million  to million during fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at permal 
distribution and service fees decreased to million primarily as a result of a decline in average aum of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds  which resulted in a decrease of million 
operating expenses compensation and benefits decreased to billion 
this decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal  the impact of cost savings initiatives  such as reductions in headcount  discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans  which are largely offset by losses in other non operating income expense 
these decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held siv issued securities 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to from in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of 
table of contents administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an million decrease in technology consulting fees  offset in part by a million increase in market data costs for services previously included in other expenses  and a million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure 
occupancy expense increased to million  primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of million 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million  primarily as a result of the sale of the lmppg business  which reduced amortization expense by million  and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year  which reduced amortization expense by million 
impairment charges increased to billion 
approximately billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former wealth management division as a result of significant declines in the aum and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division 
the remaining million relates to certain acquired management contracts  as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition  and a related trade name 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charges 
other expenses decreased million to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of million  lower professional fees of million and lower advertising costs of million 
in addition  the sale of the lmppg overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately million 
non operating income expense interest income decreased to million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances  which decreased interest income by million  offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt  which increased interest income by million 
interest expense increased to million as a result of higher debt levels 
we raised billion in may by issuing equity units  and billion in january by issuing convertible senior notes which resulted in an increase of approximately million in interest expense  of which million relates to the impact of a full year of imputed interest on our convertible senior notes 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of million principal amount of senior notes in july and lower interest rates paid on our term loan  which together resulted in a decrease of million 
fund support losses increased billion  primarily as a result of continued siv price deterioration and our elimination of siv exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other non operating income expense decreased million to a loss of million  primarily as a result of an increase of million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans  which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above  and million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit was billion compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the effective tax rate was a benefit of in the current year compared to a provision in the prior year 
the current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the siv related charges with lower state tax benefits 
in addition  the current year includes approximately million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary  offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge

liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations 
our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses 
we intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business 
these opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require  among other things  and  subject to existing covenants  the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt 
our assets consist primarily of intangible assets  cash and cash equivalents  goodwill  investment securities  and investment advisory and related fee receivables 
our assets have been principally funded by equity capital  long term debt and the results of operations 
at march   our cash  total assets  long term debt and stockholders equity were billion  billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended march in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows used for investing activities cash flows used for from financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year cash flows from operating activities were  million during fiscal compared to cash flows of million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to approximately billion of income tax refunds received during fiscal cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to cash payments of million made in connection with the acquisition of permal  and payments for fixed assets of million  principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters  partially offset by fund support collateral received of million due to the 
table of contents amendment  termination and expiration of certain capital support agreements 
cash outflows for financing activities were million  primarily due to the repayment in january of the remaining million outstanding balance on our million year term loan and million of cash consideration paid in the equity units exchange offer  as described below  and the payment of cash dividends 
we expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs 
we received approximately million in tax refunds during the june quarter  primarily attributable to tax benefits from the utilization of billion of realized losses incurred in fiscal on the sale of securities issued by sivs 
federal legislation  enacted in november to extend the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years  enabled us to utilize an additional billion of net operating loss deductions  and as a result  we received an additional million in tax refunds in january federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and future deductions for purchased goodwill and intangible assets aggregating approximately billion will reduce future taxable income and related us federal tax payments 
we may elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities  including share repurchases  seed capital investments in new products  repayment of outstanding debt  or acquisitions 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately million 
it had been anticipated that these earnings would be used for the contingent acquisition payment in the us to the former owners of permal 
we repatriated approximately million of these funds during fiscal we intend to repatriate these remaining earnings in order to create lower taxed foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized 
no further repatriation beyond the million of foreign earnings is contemplated 
as described above  we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
we also currently have approximately billion in free cash in excess of our working capital requirements  a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase common stock 
accordingly  we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect  currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity  such as an acquisition opportunity  or market conditions might significantly worsen  affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash 
if this were to occur  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting  reducing our expected expenditures on investments  selling assets such as investment securities  repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries  or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees 
should these types of actions prove insufficient  we may seek to raise additional equity or debt 
in connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model  we expect to incur restructuring and transition related costs in the range of to million over the next two fiscal years 
a portion of the restructuring and transition related costs  approximately  will be paid in shares of restricted stock or the acceleration of other equity awards 
we expect that  approximately of these costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal and the remainder in fiscal we project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately to million  and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal  excluding costs incurred to achieve these savings 

table of contents financing transactions the table below reflects our primary sources of financing in thousands as of march  amount outstanding at march  face amount at march  type interest rate maturity convertible senior notes    january senior notes from equity units    june revolving credit agreement    libor february year term loan   libor repaid january in may  we issued million equity units for billion  of which million was used to pay issuance costs 
each unit consists of a interest in  principal amount of senior notes due june  and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by june  the notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments  but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance 
the holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment 
the net proceeds from the equity units offering of approximately billion have been used for general corporate purposes  primarily the purchase of siv securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt 
during the september quarter  we completed an exchange offer for our equity units in the form of corporate units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense 
we exchanged of our outstanding corporate units  each for of a share of our common stock and in cash per corporate unit  equating to million shares of legg mason common stock and million of cash  including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs 
the transaction increased the interest coverage ratio under our bank credit facilities as a result of lower interest expense 
in connection with this transaction  we incurred transaction costs of approximately million  of which million was in cash 
during january  we increased our capital base by billion through the sale of convertible senior notes 
the proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of siv securities from our liquidity funds 
the senior notes bear interest at  payable semi annually in cash 
we are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance over its expected life of seven years  resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal and of approximately million and million  respectively 
in connection with this financing  we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes 
these hedging transactions had a net cost to us of million  which we paid from the proceeds of the notes 
these transactions closed on january  during november  we borrowed an aggregate of million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes 
the facility was scheduled to mature on october   however  in fiscal  the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to february  the facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions 
during january  we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from million to billion 
in march  we repaid million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from billion to million and further modified covenants 
in february  we amended the credit agreement to extend the expiration of the 
table of contents commitments and the maturity date of the loans  as discussed above  and further modified covenants  as discussed below 
during fiscal and  we issued approximately million and million common shares  respectively  upon conversion of approximately and shares  respectively  of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the acquisition of citigroup s asset management business in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased shares convertible into million common shares of the convertible preferred stock for approximately million in cash  using capital raised through the sale of the convertible senior notes discussed above 
in october  we borrowed million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the citigroup transaction 
effective with the closing of the citigroup transaction  we entered into a million three year amortizing interest rate swap swap to hedge a portion of the million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 
during the march quarter  this swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding million of the debt 
during fiscal  we repaid million of the debt 
the swap fully matured in december during fiscal  we repaid the remaining million outstanding balance of the debt 
the agreements entered into as part of our january issuance of billion in convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt  with a few exceptions  if our debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the documents exceeds in order to complete the may issuance of the equity units  we received a waiver of the covenant that prevents us from issuing more than million in additional debt at any time when our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds we may not  subject to a few limited exceptions  incur more than million in new indebtedness until we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness or we experience an increase in our trailing twelve month ebitda 
at march   our financial covenants under our bank agreements include maximum debt to ebitda ratio of and minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio of the maximum debt to ebitda ratio was decreased from to in a february amendment 
in february  the maximum debt to ebitda ratio was also revised to reduce the minimum amount of unrestricted cash that is not deducted from outstanding debt in calculating the ratio under the covenant from million to million 
debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money  excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt  and under capital leases 
under these net debt covenants  our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of million  as discussed above 
ebitda is defined as consolidated net income plus minus tax expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangibles  any extraordinary expenses or losses  any non cash charges and up to billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support 
as of march   our debt to ebitda ratio was and ebitda to interest expense ratio was we have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal if our net income significantly declines  or if we spend our available cash  it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants 
if we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure  we may elect to take a number of actions  including reducing our expenses in order to increase our ebitda  use available cash to repay all or a portion of our million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt 
we anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt  should it be necessary 
using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above 
entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments 
our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by three rating agencies moody s investor services moody s  standard and poor s rating services standard and poor s  and fitch ratings 
our current moody s rating is baa with a stable outlook 
our current standard and poor s rating is bbb with a negative outlook and our current fitch rating is bbb with a stable outlook 
in the event of downgrades by moody s and or standard and poor s  the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase

concurrent with the 
table of contents acquisition  permal completed a reorganization in which the residual of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares  resulting in legg mason owning of the outstanding voting common stock of permal 
we had the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and  if that right was not exercised  the holders of those equity interests had the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration 
the maximum aggregate price  including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels  for all equity interests in permal is billion  excluding acquisition costs and dividends

interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at march  the amount of commitments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the agreements 
fiscal includes million related to a put purchase option agreement with the owner of land and a building 
we currently do not intend to purchase this land and building  which could result in the forfeiture of our million escrow deposit 
the amount of contingent payments represents the fair value of the expected payment determined on the closing date of the acquisition  march  the maximum contingent payment that could be due in this fiscal year is million 
the table above does not include approximately million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which legg mason is a general or limited partner 
these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal the table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of million net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 

table of contents market risk the company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of legg mason and its subsidiaries 
under the program  certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk 
revenues and net income the majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our aum 
accordingly  a decline in the value of securities will cause our aum to decrease 
in addition  our fixed income and liquidity aum are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts 
in the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
declines in market values of aum will result in reduced fee revenues and net income 
we generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets 
declines in market values of aum in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues 
in addition  under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
our net income  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
trading and non trading assets and liabilities our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities  including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products  derivative instruments  limited partnerships  limited liability companies and certain other investment products  and previously also included securities issued by sivs and other conduit investments prior to march  trading investments at march  and subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans proprietary fund products and other investments total trading investments approximately million and million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity 
however  it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income expense 
trading investments of million and million at march  and  respectively  relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense  non operating income and net income 
approximately million and million of trading assets at march  and  respectively  are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income 
of these amounts  the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements 
the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  are allocated to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment funds  and therefore do not impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc the fluctuations in market value of approximately million in proprietary fund products as of march  are substantially offset by gains losses on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc we 
table of contents did not hedge risk on proprietary fund products as of march  investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record  has other investors  or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy 
beginning in november  we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds 
these arrangements included locs  csas  a trs arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by sivs and other conduits  all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold  or the funds sold  all remaining securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds  effectively eliminating our exposure 
prior to the purchase  the majority of these siv securities were supported under capital support arrangements  letters of credit and a trs 
the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase 
during fiscal  we also sold canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal during fiscal  the four remaining csas to provide up to million in support expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and no losses were realized 
non trading assets and liabilities at march  and subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities available for sale investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total non trading assets derivative liabilities fund support arrangements investments in partnerships and llcs at march  includes approximately million of investments related to our involvement with the us treasury s public private investment program ppip 
as previously discussed  by march   we effectively eliminated our exposure to sivs 
as of march   we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of million  for which our exposure was limited to approximately million 
after the termination of these remaining fund support arrangements during fiscal  we no longer have any exposure or additional potential losses related to supported securities 
valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within critical accounting policies under the heading valuation of financial instruments 
the elimination of siv exposure from our balance sheet and money market funds as of march  substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions 

table of contents the following is a summary of the effect of a increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at march  carrying value fair value assuming a increase fair value assuming a decrease trading investments investment related to deferred compensation plans proprietary fund products and other total trading investment available for sale investments investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total investments subject to market risk gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability  or noncontrolling interests 
in addition  investments in proprietary fund products of approximately million have been hedged to limit market risk 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings  respectively  as of march  foreign exchange sensitivity we operate primarily in the united states  but provide services  earn revenues and incur expenses outside the united states 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies  principally in brazil  poland  the united kingdom  australia  and canada  may impact our comprehensive income and net income 
certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations 
we do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates 
at march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income 
as of march   we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments 
revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our aum 
the underlying securities within the portfolios we manage  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements  are generally valued as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available  the market value of such securities  and ii with respect to other 
table of contents securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith 
for most of our mutual funds and other pooled products  the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities 
each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which  in turn  may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services  the fund accounting agent  the fund manager  broker dealers  and others or a combination thereof 
the funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate 
management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
as manager and advisor for separate accounts  we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts or may share this responsibility with others and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account aum 
separate account customers typically select the custodian 
valuation processes for aum are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients 
equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade 
debt securities under management are usually valued at bid  or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices  provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations  quotations from bond dealers  market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities 
short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost  which is designed to approximate fair value 
the vast majority of our aum is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services  fund accounting agents  custodians and brokers 
this varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class 
regardless of the valuation process or pricing source  we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
where market prices are not readily available  or are determined not to reflect fair value  value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on  among other things  unobservable inputs 
management fees on aum where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material 
as of march   equity  fixed income and liquidity aum values aggregated billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
as the vast majority of our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our aum 
the recent economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility  however  the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
as of march   less than of total aum is valued based on unobservable inputs 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  except long term debt 
trading investments  investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
for investments  we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations  when available 
fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices 
we evaluate our non trading investment securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 

table of contents in fiscal and  we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions 
the fair values of these derivative instruments were based on management s estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds  effectively eliminating our exposure to sivs  and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase 
as of march   four capital support arrangements  which supported investments in non asset backed securities  remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of million was included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
no derivative asset was recorded as of march  during fiscal  these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of million were recovered 
none of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the related gains and losses are included in fund support in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal  and for trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry 
as of march  and  we owned approximately million and million  respectively  of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs 
at march  and  we also have approximately million and million  respectively  of other investments  such as investment partnerships  that are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method  with the exception of million of investments  as of march   related to our involvement with the us treasury s ppip  which are recorded at fair value 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
the accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of non performance 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets  which  for us  include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets 
level financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or prices are based on observable inputs  other than quoted prices  such as models or other valuation methodologies 
for us  this category may include repurchase agreements  fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products 
level financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs  including those for which there is little or no market activity 
this category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships  limited liability companies  and private equity funds 
previously  this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by sivs 
this category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions 

table of contents the valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
proprietary fund products are valued at nav determined by the fund administrator 
these funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices 
their valuations may be classified as level  level or level based on whether the fund is exchange traded  the frequency of the related nav determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities private equity and investment partnerships for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available  management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value 
these valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require management s judgment and are therefore classified in level as a practical expedient  we rely on the nav of certain investments as their fair value 
the navs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date 
as of march   approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and no liabilities meet the definition of level any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
intangible assets and goodwill balances as of march  are as follows americas international total asset management contracts indefinite life intangible assets trade names goodwill our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts  contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions 
asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
similarly  trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows  which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates  projected net client flows and market performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed 
the discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below 
for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill  we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation depreciation on cash flows for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our past experience  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 

table of contents beyond five years  our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values 
triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business  legal or regulatory environment  loss of key personnel  significant business dispositions  or other events 
if a triggering event has occurred  we perform tests  which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions  to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
at a minimum  we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at december we completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of december   and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of december  further  no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended march   as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values 
we have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of march   therefore  no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary 
amortizable intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts 
projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current aum for the applicable contracts 
contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset 
the remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates 
if the amortization periods are not appropriate  the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from to years with a weighted average life of approximately years 
indefinite life intangible assets for intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite  fair value is determined from a market participant s perspective based on projected discounted cash flows 
we have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets proprietary fund contracts and  to a lesser extent  trade names 
we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows  which take into consideration estimates of profit margins  growth rates and discount rates 
an asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward years  assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance 
contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit  such as contracts within the same family of funds  are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions 
similarly  cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 

table of contents the domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the citigroup asset management cam acquisition of  million and the permal funds of hedge funds contracts of million account for approximately and  respectively  of our indefinite life intangible assets 
for our december  annual impairment test  cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual rate of approximately thereafter 
cash flows on the permal contracts were assumed to have a year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual rate of approximately thereafter 
the projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and permal funds were discounted at and  respectively 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to and  respectively  for the asset to be deemed impaired 
the approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by million and million  respectively 
trade names account for of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to permal 
we tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows  similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
we have defined the reporting units to be the americas and international divisions  which are the same as our operating segments 
allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure  acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to business segments 
significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit  including profit margins  expected current and long term cash flow growth rates  and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows 
cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity  by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon  among other things  historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources 
the impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our experience  our internal financial projections  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective 
we estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates 
we estimate the cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk and size premiums  peer group betas and unsystematic risk 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values 
goodwill in the americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of cam and royce 
the value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our us mutual funds  closed end funds and other proprietary funds  in addition to separate account assets of our us managers 
goodwill in the international reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of permal and the international cam businesses 
for our december  annual impairment test  the projected cash flows were discounted at and  respectively  for the americas and international divisions to determine the present value of cash flows 
as of december   the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the americas and international divisions 
projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the americas division  were assumed to have a year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a longterm annual growth rate of approximately 

table of contents projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the international division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 
cash flow growth for the americas and international divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity  fixed income  and liquidity products 
equity product growth projections were based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods  in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions 
fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and market influences relevant to their business 
long term growth of for both divisions was based on our historical experience  available historic market statistics  and estimates of future expectations 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the americas and international reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately and percentage points  respectively  for goodwill to be considered for impairment 
as of december   considering relevant prices of our common shares  our market capitalization  along with a reasonable control premium  exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation plans include stock options  employee stock purchase plans  market based performance share awards  restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock 
under our stock compensation plans  we issue equity awards to directors  officers  and key employees 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  compensation expense for the years ended march   and includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method 
unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
also under the accounting guidance  cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows 
we granted million  million  and million stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
for additional information on share based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model  except for market based grants  for which we use a monte carlo option pricing model 
both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables 
the inputs for the black scholes model include stock price on the date of grant  exercise price of the option  dividend yield  volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate  all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions 
we calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options 
we estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant 
the expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled  based upon our historical option exercise experience 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued 
if we used different methods to estimate our variables for the black scholes and monte carlo models  or if we used a different type of option pricing model  the fair value of our option grants might be different 
income taxes legg mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal  state and local jurisdictions of the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction 
due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation 
table of contents of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes 
management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision 
substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to us and united kingdom uk taxing jurisdictions 
as of march   uk federal deferred tax assets aggregated million  realization of which is expected to require billion of future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
based on estimates of future taxable income  using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing  it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time 
to the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities  we have considered the timing  nature and jurisdiction of reversals 
while tax planning may enhance our positions  the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies 
as of march   us state deferred tax assets aggregated million 
due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and  taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies  a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of million for fiscal year due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates  the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary 
as of march   uk deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  are not material 
an additional valuation allowance was recorded on million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions 
in the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable  we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made 
depending on the facts and circumstances  the charge could be material to our earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
consolidation special purpose entities spes are trusts  partnerships  corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose 
spes generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement  derive continued benefit  exhibit control or have recourse 
we do not utilize spes as a form of financing or to provide liquidity  nor have we recognized any gains or losses from the sale of assets to spes 
in accordance with accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  spes are designated as either a voting interest entity or a vie  with vies subject to consolidation by the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary  if any 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  either contractual or implied  or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
generally  limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also considered vies 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  or if there is no such entity  the entity that will receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  if any 
in accordance with the accounting guidance  our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker 
under current guidance  it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for vies created to manage assets for clients unless our ownership interest  including interests of related parties  in a vie is substantial  unless we may earn significant performance fees from the vie or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest 
the accounting guidance also requires the disclosure of vies in which we are a sponsor or are considered to have a significant variable interest 
in determining whether a variable interest is significant  we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary 
in 
table of contents determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of vies  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders  economic participation of all parties  including how fees are earned by and paid to us  related party ownership  guarantees and implied relationships 
in determining the primary beneficiary  we must make assumptions and estimates about  among other things  the future performance of the underlying assets held by the vie  including investment returns  cash flows and credit and interest rate risks 
these assumptions and estimates have a significant bearing on the determination of the primary beneficiary 
if we  together with our related party relationships  are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a vie  the entity is consolidated within our financial statements 
if our assumptions or estimates were to be materially incorrect  we might be required to consolidate additional vies 
consolidation of these vies would result in an increase in assets with a corresponding increase in noncontrolling interests or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  and a decrease in investment advisory fees and an increase or decrease in other non operating income expense with a corresponding offset in noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations  but would have no impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc as further discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  there are amendments and proposed amendments to consolidation accounting that may require us to consolidate additional vies or voting interest entities 
as of march   we are the primary beneficiary of one sponsored investment fund vie  which resulted in consolidation 
this vie had total assets and total equity of million as of march   and million as of march  our investment in this vie was million and million as of march  and  respectively  which represents our maximum risk of loss
