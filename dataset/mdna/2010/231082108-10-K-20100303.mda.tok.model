risk factors 
highlights during and overview the advertising environment for lagged behind the rab has reported that trends in radio advertising revenue mirrored fluctuations in the current economic environment yielding declining results over the last three years 
in  advertising revenues decreased  after decreasing in and in during the third quarter of  we reviewed the triggering events and circumstances detailed in asc  property  plant and equipment to determine if an interim test of impairment of goodwill might be necessary 
in july  we revised our revenue forecast downward for the last two quarters of due to the sustained decline in revenues attributable to the current economic conditions 
as a result of these conditions  we determined it was appropriate and reasonable to conduct an interim impairment analysis 
in conjunction with the interim impairment analysis we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
in addition  as part of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and broadcast licenses conducted in the fourth quarter  we further revised our revenue forecast downward for certain markets due to a larger than forecasted decline in overall operating results for those markets  and  as a result  we recorded a further impairment charge of approximately million to further reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
on june   we entered into the amendment to the credit agreement 
the credit agreement maintains the preexisting term loan facility of million  which  as of december   had an outstanding balance of approximately million  and reduced the preexisting revolving credit facility from million to million 
additional facilities are no longer permitted under the credit agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources amended credit agreement for further discussion of the credit agreement 
on april   we completed an asset exchange agreement with clear channel 
as part of the asset exchange  we acquired two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio in consideration for five of our radio stations in green bay  wisconsin 
in conjunction with the exchange  we and clear channel entered into an lma whereby we will provide programming  sell advertising  and retain operating profits for managing the five green bay radio stations 
in consideration for these rights  we will pay clear channel a monthly fee of approximately million over the term of the agreement 
the term of the lma is for five years  expiring on december  in conjunction with the lma  we have included the net revenues and station operating expenses associated with operating the green bay stations in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the lma april  through december  additionally  clear channel negotiated a written put option that allows them to require us to repurchase the five green bay radio stations at any time during the two month period commencing july  or earlier if the lma agreement is terminated prior to this date for million the fair value of the radio stations as of april  
we accounted for the put option as a derivative contract and accordingly  the fair value of the put was recorded as a liability at the acquisition date and offset against the gain associated with the asset exchange 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the derivative are recorded through earnings 
see liquidity and capital resources completed acquisitions green bay and cincinnati swap 

table of contents liquidity considerations we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our debt covenants through at least december   based upon actions we have already taken  which included i the amendment to the credit agreement  the purpose of which was to provide certain covenant relief in and  ii employee reductions of during coupled with a mandatory one week furlough during the second quarter of  iii a new sales initiative implemented during the first quarter of  which we believe will increase advertising revenues by re engineering our sales techniques through enhanced training of our sales force and greater focus on broadening our revenue base beyond traditional advertisers  and iv continued scrutiny of all operating expenses 
we will continue to monitor our revenues and cost structure closely and if revenues do not exceed forecasted growth or if we exceed our planned spending  we may take further actions as needed in an attempt to maintain compliance with our debt covenants under the credit agreement 
the actions may include the implementation of additional operational efficiencies  cost reductions  further renegotiation of major vendor contracts  deferral of capital expenditures  and sales of non strategic assets 
as of december   the effective interest rate on the borrowings pursuant to the credit facility was approximately 
as of december   our average cost of debt  including the effects of our derivative positions  was 
we remain committed to maintaining manageable debt levels  which will continue to improve our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
our business we engage in the acquisition  operation  and development of commercial radio stations in mid size radio markets in the united states 
in addition  we  along with three private equity firms  formed cmp  which acquired the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna in may as a result of our investment in cmp and the acquisition of susquehanna s radio operations  we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations and believe we are the fourth largest radio broadcasting company based on net revenues 
as of december   directly and through our investment in cmp  we owned or operated stations in united states markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to one additional station 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by various ratings agencies on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million in  million in and million in our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
local advertising represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year as advertising generally declines following the winter 
table of contents holidays  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  which follows in this section

our management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december   and have been presented on a historical basis 
year ended december  versus year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million decrease in political revenue and the impact the recent economic recession has had across our entire station platform 
we believe that advertising revenue in our markets will have no significant growth at least through the first quarter of with modest growth in certain categories throughout the remainder of we believe two areas of potentially strong growth for radio advertising in could be cyclical political advertising and automotive advertising fueled by a general recovery in that sector 

table of contents station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
station operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our continued efforts to contain operating costs  such as employee reductions  a mandatory one week furlough  and continued scrutiny of operating expenses 
we will continue to monitor all our operating costs and  to the extent we are able to identify any additional cost saving measures we will implement them  in an attempt to remain compliant with current and future covenant requirements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully depreciated coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures 
lma fees 
lma fees totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lma fees in the current year were comprised primarily of fees associated with stations operated under lmas in cedar rapids  iowa  ann arbor  michigan  green bay  wisconsin  and battle creek  michigan 
corporate general and administrative including non cash stock compensation expense 
corporate operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to non recurring severance costs and other professional fees associated with corporate restructuring of approximately million  an increase of million in professional fees associated with our defense of certain lawsuits  transaction costs associated with an asset exchange and the amendment to the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities  and a million increase in franchise taxes resulting from one time prior period credits  partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock compensation  with the remaining million increase attributable to miscellaneous expenses 
realized loss on derivative instrument 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million related to our recording of the fair market value of the green bay option 
we entered into the green bay option in conjunction with an asset exchange in the second quarter of  therefore  there is no amount related to the green bay option recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the green bay option declined in value primarily due to the continued decline in the market operating results 
gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during the second quarter of we completed an exchange transaction with clear channel to swap five of our radio stations in green bay  wisconsin for two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million during the second quarter 
we did not complete any similar transactions in the prior year 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we recorded approximately million and million of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impairment loss related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded during the third and fourth quarters of was primarily due to changes in certain key assumptions and estimates used to determine fair value 
the primary drivers of the change were decreases in advertising revenue growth projections for the radio broadcasting industry see note  fair value measurements in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this report 
costs associated with terminated transaction 
we did not incur any costs associated with a terminated transaction for the year ended december  as compared to million in these costs were attributable to a going private transaction that was terminated in may interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended year ended december  interest expense associated with outstanding debt decreased by million to million as compared to million in the prior year s period  primarily due to lower average levels of bank debt  as well as a decrease in the interest rates associated with our indebtedness 
this decrease was offset by a million 
table of contents increase in the yield adjustment associated with our interest rate swap  due to a decrease in the libor rate 
we fixed million of our term loan assuming interest rates would continue to increase  however  in light of the recent economic downturn our borrowing rates have significantly decreased and remain extremely low 
thus  this fluctuation in the derivative increased our interest expense

we recorded a tax benefit of million as compared with a million benefit during the prior year 
the income tax benefit in both periods is primarily due to the impairment charge on intangible assets 
equity loss in affiliate 
in and our share of cmp s accumulated deficit exceeded our investment in cmp and as a result we did not record a gain or loss in in  the equity losses in affiliate were limited to our investment in cmp  which totaled million

table of contents in light of the overall economic environment  we continue to monitor whether any impairment triggers are present and we may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods 
our impairment testing requires us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth of our businesses 
additionally the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairments tests are performed 
the recent general economic pressures that impacted both the national and a number of our local economies may result in non cash impairments in future periods 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
we continue to monitor whether any impairment triggers are present and may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods 
the recent economic crisis has reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations 
as such  revenue projections for the industry were down  which impacted our calculation by virtue of reducing our future cash flows  resulting in a proportionate reduction in our discounted cash flow valuation 
likewise  the combination of a decline in current revenues and future projected revenues coupled with frozen capital markets have contributed significantly to a decline in transactions to acquire or sell companies within the industry  the result of which has been a compression in the multiples on the radio station transactions that have been completed in recent years 
in the aggregate  these recent economic developments have resulted in significant downward pressures on valuations across the radio industry as a whole 
therefore  as a company that has experienced significant synthetic growth at historically greater multiples than those currently utilized in our valuation model  we are experiencing relatively large write downs associated with our impairment calculation

we recorded approximately million of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended december  the impairment loss in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note  goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used  a decrease in station transaction multiples  and a decrease in advertising revenue growth projections for the broadcasting industry

seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and repayments of bank borrowings interest payments capital expenditures repurchases of common stock acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets funding needs on a long term basis will include capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations  implementing hd radio tm technology and potential future acquisitions 
in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology on up to of our stations 
under the terms of our original agreement with ibiquity  we agreed to convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our agreement with ibiquity to reduce the number of planned conversions  extend the build out schedule  and increase the license fees to be paid for each converted station 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between million and million 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or  audience tastes  and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us 
management has taken steps to mitigate this risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancements to our credit approval process 
as discussed further below  borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
in addition  pursuant to the june amendment to the credit agreement  we are required to repay excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis beginning september  through december   while maintaining a minimum balance of million of cash on hand 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined  based on our financial condition as of december   that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and  if necessary  further financing activities  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and debt service payments and potential acquisitions and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations through december  however  given the uncertainty of our markets cash flows  pending litigation and the impact of the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that cash generated from operations will be sufficient or financing will be available at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
consideration of recent economic developments and the outlook for the economic crisis in has reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations 
in consideration of current and projected market conditions  we expect that overall advertising revenues will have no growth at least through the first quarter of with modest growth in certain categories throughout the remainder of therefore  in conjunction with the development of the business plan  we assessed the impact of the current year market developments in a variety of areas  including our forecasted advertising revenues and liquidity 
in response to these conditions  we have forecasted maintaining cost reductions achieved in with no significant increases in while preparing our business plan  we assessed future covenant compliance under our credit agreement  including consideration of market uncertainties  as well as the incremental cost that would be required to potentially 
table of contents amend the terms of the credit agreement 
we believe we will continue to be in compliance with all of our debt covenants through at least december  based upon actions we have already taken  as well as through additional paydowns of debt we will be required to make during from existing cash balances and cash flow generated from operations 
further discussion of our debt covenant compliance considerations is included below 
if our revenues were to be significantly less than planned due to difficult market conditions or for other reasons  our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements would become increasingly difficult without remedial measures  such as the implementation of further cost abatement initiatives 
if our remedial measures were not successful in maintaining covenant compliance  then we would need to negotiate with our lenders for relief  which relief could result in higher interest expense or other fees or costs 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our credit agreements and failure to negotiate relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million and increased million  respectively 
excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels of operating income for and as compared with the prior years 
as a result  the movement in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
at december  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures  a million decrease in proceeds from the sales of radio assets year over year 
net cash used in investing activities increased million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures as well as a decrease of million in proceeds from the sales of radio assets year over year and a decrease of million cash used to fund acquisition costs 
cash flows used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased million  primarily due to repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased million  due to repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
during  net cash used in financing activities decreased million  primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with share repurchases offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the refinancing as compared to the refinancing 
completed acquisitions green bay and cincinnati swap on april   we completed an asset exchange agreement with clear channel 
as part of the asset exchange  we acquired two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio in consideration for five of our radio stations in the green bay  wisconsin market 
the exchange transaction provided us with direct entry into the cincinnati market notwithstanding our current presence in cincinnati through our investment in cmp  which 
table of contents was ranked at that time by arbitron 
larger markets are generally desirable for national advertisers  and have large and diversified local business communities providing for a large base of potential advertising clients 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with guidance for business combinations 
the fair value of the assets acquired in the exchange was million refer to the table below for the purchase price allocation 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs related to this transaction and expensed them as incurred through earnings within corporate general and administrative expense 
the results of operations for the cincinnati stations acquired are included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date 
the results of the cincinnati stations were not material 
prior to the asset exchange  we did not have a preexisting relationship with clear channel within the green bay market 
in conjunction with the exchange  we entered into an lma with clear channel whereby we provide programming  sell advertising  and retain operating profits for managing the five green bay radio stations 
in consideration for these rights  we pay clear channel a monthly fee of approximately million over the term of the agreement 
the term of the lma is for five years  expiring december  in conjunction with the lma  we included the net revenues and station operating expenses associated with operating the green bay stations in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the lma april  through december  additionally  clear channel negotiated the green bay option  which allows them to require us to repurchase the five green bay radio stations at any time during the two month period commencing july  or earlier if the lma agreement is terminated prior to this date for million the fair value of the radio stations as of april  
we accounted for the green bay option as a derivative contract and accordingly  the fair value of the green bay option was recorded as a liability at the acquisition date and offset against the gain associated with the asset exchange 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the derivative are recorded through earnings 
in conjunction with the transactions  we recorded a net gain of million  which is included in gain on exchange of assets in the statement of operations 
this amount represents a gain of approximately million recorded on the green bay stations sold  net of a loss of approximately million representing the fair value of the green bay option at acquisition date

the transaction was accounted for in accordance with the guidance for business combinations 
this transaction was not material to our results

table of contents pending acquisitions at the beginning of  we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which we would exchange one of our fort walton beach  florida radio stations  wyzb fm  for another owned by star  wtke fm 
specifically  the parties agreement provided for the exchange of wyzb fm plus million in cash for wtke fm 
following the filing of the assignment applications with the fcc  the applications were challenged by qantum  which had a contract with star to acquire wtke fm 
although star represented to us that the qantum contract had been terminated  qantum contended that star s termination was void and that its contract was still in effect 
qantum submitted a complaint to the fcc that our proposed swap with star would give us an unfair competitive advantage because the station we would acquire reaches more people than the station we would be giving up 
qantum also initiated litigation in the united states district court for the southern district of florida against star and secured a court decision that required star to sell the station to qantum instead of us 
that decision was affirmed on appeal of the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit  and qantum consummated its acquisition of wtke fm on november  therefore  we will not be implementing our proposed swap with star for wtke fm 
amended credit agreement amendment we experienced revenue declines in late and throughout in line with macro industry trends and consistent with our radio peer group  particularly when compared to groups with similar market sizes and portfolio composition 
in anticipation of significant revenue declines and in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these declines on profitability  in early we engaged in an aggressive cost cutting campaign across all of our stations and at corporate headquarters as well 
however  even with these cost containment initiatives in place  our rapidly deteriorating revenue outlook left uncertainty as to whether we would be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in the then existing credit agreement 
as an additional measure  in june we obtained an amendment to the credit agreement that  among other things  temporarily suspended certain financial covenants  as further described below 
the credit agreement maintains the preexisting term loan facility of million  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million immediately after closing the amendment  and reduced the preexisting revolving credit facility from million to million 
incremental facilities are no longer permitted as of june  under the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted including fcc licenses held by its subsidiaries  including  without limitation  intellectual property and all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including broadcast software international  inc  which prior to the amendment  was an excluded subsidiary 
our obligations under the credit agreement continue to be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains terms and conditions customary for financing arrangements of this nature 
the term loan facility will mature on june  the revolving credit facility will mature on june  borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate defined as the higher of the bank of america  na prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus

events of default in the credit agreement include  among others  a the failure to pay when due the obligations owing under the credit facilities  b the failure to perform and not timely remedy  if applicable certain covenants  c cross default and cross acceleration  d the occurrence of bankruptcy or insolvency events  e certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries  f the loss  revocation or suspension of  or any material impairment in the ability to use of or more of  any of our material fcc licenses  g any representation or warranty made  or report  certificate or financial statement delivered  to the lenders subsequently proven to have been incorrect in any material respect  and h the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may terminate the loan commitments  accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the credit agreement and the ancillary loan documents as a secured party 
as discussed above  our covenants for the year ended december  were as follows a minimum trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda of million  a million minimum cash on hand  and a limit on annual capital expenditures of million annually 
the trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda and cash on hand at december  were million and million  respectively 
if we had been unable to obtain the june amendments to the credit agreement  such that the original total leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants were still operative  those covenants for the year ended december  would have been as follows a maximum total leverage ratio of  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 
table of contents at december   the total leverage ratio was and the fixed charge coverage ratio was for the fiscal quarter ending march  the first quarter after the covenant suspension period  the total leverage ratio covenant will be and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be company outlook management believes that the company will continue to be in compliance with all of its debt covenants through at least december   based upon actions the company has already taken  which include i the amendment to the credit agreement  the purpose of which was to provide certain covenant relief in and see note  long term debt  ii employee reductions of in coupled with a mandatory one week furlough during the second quarter of  iii a new sales initiative implemented during the first quarter of  which we believe will increase advertising revenues by re engineering the company s sales techniques through enhanced training of its sales force  and iv continued scrutiny of all operating expenses 
however  the company will continue to monitor its revenues and cost structure closely and if revenues do not exceed expected growth or if the company exceeds planned spending  the company may take further actions as needed in an attempt to maintain compliance with its debt covenants under the credit agreement 
the actions may include the implementation of additional operational efficiencies  additional cost reductions  renegotiation of major vendor contracts  deferral of capital expenditures  and sales of non strategic assets 
as discussed further in note  long term debt  we amended the credit agreement in june  whereby the total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for the covenant suspension period have been suspended 
during the covenant suspension period  our loan covenants require us to maintain a minimum trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of million for fiscal quarters through march   increasing incrementally to million for fiscal quarter ended december   subject to certain adjustments  and maintain minimum cash on hand defined as unencumbered consolidated cash and cash equivalents of at least million 
for the fiscal quarter ending march  the first quarter after the covenant suspension period  the total leverage ratio covenant will be and the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be at december   our total leverage ratio was and the fixed charge coverage ratio was in order to comply with the leverage ratio covenant at march   we estimate that we will be required to reduce a significant amount of debt by march  we plan to fund these debt payments from cash flows generated from operations 
if we are unable to comply with our debt covenants  we would need to seek a waiver or amendment to the credit agreement and no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so 
if we were unable to obtain a waiver or an amendment to the credit agreement in the event of a debt covenant violation  we would be in default under the credit agreement  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
if the company were unable to repay its debts when due  the lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
the company has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral under the credit agreement 
if the lenders accelerate the maturity of outstanding debt  the company may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of the senior secured credit facilities  and the company cannot be assured that sufficient assets will remain after it has paid all of the its debt 
the ability to liquidate assets is affected by the regulatory restrictions associated with radio stations  including fcc licensing  which may make the market for these assets less liquid and increase the chances that these assets will be liquidated at a significant loss 
warrants we issued warrants to the lenders in connection with the execution of the amendment to the credit agreement which allow the holders to acquire up to million shares of our class a common stock 
each warrant is immediately exercisable to purchase our underlying class a common stock at an exercise price of per share and has an expiration date of june  
table of contents accounting for the modification of the credit agreement the amendment to the credit agreement was accounted for as a loan modification and accordingly  we did not record a gain or a loss on the transaction 
for the revolving credit facility  we wrote off approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs  based on the reduction of capacity 
with respect to both debt instruments  we recorded million of fees paid directly to the lenders as a debt discount which are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
we classified the warrants as equity at million at fair value at inception 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a debt discount and is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method 
as of december   prior to the effect of the forward starting libor based interest rate swap arrangement entered into in may may swap  the effective interest rate of the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities was approximately 
as of december   the effective interest rate inclusive of the may swap was approximately 
refinancing on june   we entered into an amendment to our then existing credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided for a replacement million term loan facility and maintained the million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds were used to repay the prior term loan and revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the replacement term loan facility bore interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus a margin ranging between and or the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging between and in either case dependent upon our leverage ratio 
in may  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement that became effective in march  following the termination of our previous swap agreement 
this swap agreement effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our floating rate bank borrowings through march as of december   prior to the effect of the may swap  the effective interest rate of the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement was approximately  inclusive of the may swap  the effective interest rate was

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
all past due balances are reviewed for collectability  particularly those over days 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although our management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
we are required to review the carrying value of our goodwill and certain intangible assets annually  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  for impairment and record any impairment to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we had million in intangible assets and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach and discounted cash flow methodology 
as part of our overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill  we have determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the reporting units are based on currently available data and management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed the triggering events and circumstances detailed in asc  property  plant and equipment  to determine if an interim test of impairment of goodwill was warranted 
in july  we revised our revenue forecast downward for the last two quarters of due to the sustained decline in revenues attributable to the current economic conditions 
as a result of these conditions  we determined it was appropriate and reasonable to conduct an interim impairment analysis 
in conjunction with the interim impairment analysis we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
in addition  as part of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and broadcast licenses conducted during the fourth quarter  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to further reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill in certain markets to their respective fair market values 
the additional impairment charge was primarily due to the changes in key variables incorporated in the discounted cash flow methodology and a larger than expected decline in overall operating results in those markets compared to management s prior forecasts 

table of contents we generally conducted our impairment tests as follows step goodwill test in performing our interim impairment testing of goodwill  the fair value of each market was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  an income approach 
the discounted cash flow approach requires the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate 
we used an approximate eight year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant level 
we made certain assumptions regarding future audience shares and revenue shares in reference to actual historical performance 
we then projected future operating expenses in order to derive operating profits  which we combined with working capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows 
for our third quarter interim impairment test and our annual impairment test  we performed the step test and compared the fair value of each market to its carrying value as of august  and december   respectively 
for markets where a step indicator of impairment existed  we then performed step test in order to determine if goodwill was impaired on any of our markets 
for our third quarter interim and annual analyses  we determined that  based on our step goodwill test  the fair value of of our markets containing goodwill balances was below its carrying value  respectively 
for the remaining markets  since no impairment indicator existed  we determined that goodwill was appropriately stated as of the relevant testing date 
step goodwill test as required by the step test  we prepared an allocation of the fair value of the markets identified in the step test as if each market was acquired in a business combination 
the presumed purchase price utilized in the calculation is the fair value of the market determined in the step test 
the results of the step test and the calculated impairment charge for the third quarter interim test follows in thousands reporting unit implied goodwill august  market id fair value value carrying value impairment market the results of the step test and the calculated impairment charge for the fourth quarter annual test follows in thousands reporting unit implied goodwill december  market id fair value value carrying value impairment market 
table of contents the following table provides a breakdown of the goodwill balances as of december   by market market id goodwill balance market market market market market market market market market market market market market market market market to validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of the impairment charge related to goodwill  we conducted an overall reasonableness check of our fair value calculations by comparing the aggregate  calculated fair value of our markets to our market capitalization as of august  for our third quarter interim test and as of december  for our fourth quarter annual test  prepared a market fair value calculation using a multiple of adjusted ebitda as a comparative data point to validate the fair values calculated using the discounted cash flow approach  reviewed the historical operating performance of each market with impairment  the discount rate employed in the market fair value calculation ranged between and for our third quarter interim test 
as a result of changes to variables used to estimate the cost of equity such as the year t bond and the discount rate for market risk  we employed a discount rate range of to for our fourth quarter annual test 
we believe that the discount rate ranges were appropriate and reasonable for goodwill purposes at the time of each test due to the resulting implied times exit multiple for both the interim and annual periods 
for periods after  we projected a median annual revenue growth of and median annual operating expense to increase at a growth rate of for our third quarter interim test 
we increased this projection to and  respectively  for our fourth quarter annual test  primarily because of changes in market revenue forecasts as of december  compared to september  for each test we derived projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical financial performance and expected future revenue growth 
our projections were based on then current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the markets 
after completing our third quarter interim test  as compared with the market capitalization value of million as of august   the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately million was approximately million  or  higher than market capitalization 
after completing our fourth quarter annual test  as compared with the market capitalization value of million as of december   the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately million was approximately million  or  less than market capitalization 

table of contents key data points included in the market capitalization calculations were as follows shares outstanding of million as of august  and december   average closing price of the company s class a common stock over days for august  and december  and per share  respectively  and debt discounted by and gross million and million  net million and million  on august  and december   respectively 
utilizing the above analysis and data points  we concluded the fair values of our markets  as calculated  are appropriate and reasonable 
indefinite lived intangibles fcc licenses we perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles our fcc licenses during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
consistent with the guidance set forth in asc  we have combined all of our broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes 
as part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite lived intangibles test  we determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing 
in august  we reviewed for potential issues or circumstances that might require us to test our fcc license assets for impairment on an interim basis 
in july  we revised our revenue forecast downward for the last two quarters of due to the sustained decline in revenues for attributable to the current economic conditions 
as a result of these conditions  we determined it was appropriate and reasonable to conduct an interim impairment analysis 
during the fourth quarter  we performed our annual impairment testing 
as a result of the interim and annual impairment tests  we determined that the carrying value of certain reporting units fcc licenses exceeded their fair values 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million and million as a result of the interim and annual impairment tests  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
we note that the following considerations continue to apply to the fcc licenses in each market  the broadcast licenses were purchased to be used as one combined asset  the combined group of licenses in a market represents the highest and best use of the assets  and each market s strategy provides evidence that the licenses are complementary 
for the interim and annual impairment tests we utilized the three most widely accepted approaches in conducting our appraisals the cost approach  the market approach  and the income approach 
in conducting the appraisals  we conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued 
the cost approach measures value by determining the current cost of an asset and deducting for all elements of depreciation ie  physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence 
in its simplest form  the cost approach is calculated by subtracting all depreciation from current replacement cost 
the market approach measures value based on recent sales and offering prices of similar properties and analyzes the data to arrive at an indication of the most probable sales price of the subject property 
the income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject property  which is then analyzed and projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value 
we relied on both the income and market approaches for the valuation of the fcc licenses  with the exception of certain am and fm stations that have been valued using the cost approach 
we estimated this replacement value based on estimated legal  consulting  engineering  and internal charges to be  for each fm station 
for each am station the replacement cost was estimated at  for a station licensed to operate with a one tower array and an additional charge of  for each additional tower in the station s tower array 

table of contents the estimated fair values of the fcc licenses represent the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties ie other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
a basic assumption in our valuation of these fcc licenses was that these radio stations were new radio stations  signing on the air as of the date of the valuation 
we assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date  except that these stations were just beginning operations 
in doing so  we bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly valued the fcc licenses 
we estimated the values of the am and fm licenses  combined  through a discounted cash flow analysis  which is an income valuation approach 
in addition to the income approach  we also reviewed recent similar radio station sales in similarly sized markets 
in estimating the value of the am and fm licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis  in order to make the net free cash flow to invested capital projections  we began with market revenue projections 
we made assumptions about the stations future audience shares and revenue shares in order to project the stations future revenues 
we then projected future operating expenses and operating profits derived 
by combining these operating profits with depreciation  taxes  additions to working capital  and capital expenditures  we projected net free cash flows 
we discounted the net free cash flows using an appropriate after tax average weighted cost of capital ranging between approximately and for the interim test and to for the annual test  and then calculated the total discounted net free cash flows 
for net free cash flows beyond the projection period  we estimated a perpetuity value  and then discounted to present values  as of the valuation date 
we performed discounted cash flow analyses for each market 
for each market valued we analyzed the competing stations  including revenue and listening shares for the past several years 
in addition  for each market we analyzed the discounted cash flow valuations of its assets within the market 
finally  we prepared a detailed analysis of sales of comparable stations 
the first discounted cash flow analysis examined historical and projected gross radio revenues for each market 
in order to estimate what listening audience share and revenue share would be expected for each station by market  we analyzed the arbitron audience estimates over the past two years to determine the average local commercial share garnered by similar am and fm stations competing in those radio markets 
often we made adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on its stations signal coverage of the market and the surrounding area s population as compared to the other stations in the market 
based on management s knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets  we determined that approximately three years would be required for the stations to reach maturity 
we also incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model the stations gross revenues through  the projected operating expenses and profits over the same period of time we considered operating expenses  except for sales expenses  to be fixed  and assumed sales expenses to be a fixed percentage of revenues  the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital  depreciation on start up construction costs and capital expenditures we calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines over five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on the air  and amortization of the intangible asset the fcc license we calculated amortization on a straight line basis over years 

table of contents we performed the following sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a change in certain variables contained within the impairment model increase in license impairment at august  at december  assumption change in millions decline in revenue growth rates decline in station operating income increase in discount rate after federal and state taxes are subtracted  net free cash flows were reduced for working capital 
according to recent editions of risk management association s annual statement studies  over the past five years  the typical radio station has an average ratio of sales to working capital of 
in other words  approximately of a typical radio station s sales go to working capital 
as a result  we have allowed for working capital in the amount of of the station s incremental net revenues for each year of the projection period 
after subtracting federal and state taxes and accounting for the additions to working capital  we determined net free cash flows 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of asc  the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
we have a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of these net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense recognized under asc  compensation share based payment asc  for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million respectively  before income taxes 
upon adopting asc  for awards with service conditions  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for restricted stock awards with performance conditions  we have evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and have adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases digital radio capital obligations other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents under the credit agreement  the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants 
based on long term debt amounts outstanding at december   scheduled annual principal amortization and the current effective interest rate on such long term debt amounts outstanding  we would be obligated to pay approximately million of interest on borrowings through june million due in less than one  year  million due in years two and three  million due in years four and five  and million due after five years

while reaffirming the existing definition of fair value  the asu reintroduces the concept of entry value into the determination of fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in may  we entered into a forward starting effective march libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
in may  the company also entered into an interest rate option agreement the may option  which provides for bank of america to unilaterally extend the period of the may swap for two additional years  from march  through march  this option was exercised on march  by bank of america 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  that are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk none of our operations are measured in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are not subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
