cc  
tv  
name  
jobs and 
edu domain names 
as of december   we had approximately million domain names registered under the 
com and 
net registries  which are our principal registries 
the number of domain names registered is largely driven by internet usage and broadband penetration rates 
although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in mature markets such as the united states us and western europe  growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us and western europe where internet penetration has demonstrated the greatest potential for growth 
we are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for 
com and 
net registrations are in us dollars 
verisign internet defense services provide infrastructure assurance to organizations and is comprised of verisign idefense security intelligence service idefense and verisign internet defense network vidn 
revenues from verisign internet defense services are not significant

the major factors 
table of contents impacting the growth and performance of our business authentication services are the penetration and adoption of the internet  especially through broadband services  the spread of e commerce  the utilization of electronic means for executing financial transactions such as credit card payments  and the extent to which advertising through search engines encourages consumers to engage in e commerce

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates related to both the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
as our naming services and authentication services are provided over time  the associated revenues from these services are generally recognized over the contractual term 
however  certain revenues are recognized over an estimated relationship period determined based on an analysis of historical performance and customer usage 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain revenue transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenues on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
fair value determination of acquired net assets  especially intangible assets  requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgment 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  c unanticipated competition  d loss of key personnel  e a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  f testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and their effect on any impairment determination 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the transaction approach is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices on actual transactions and asking prices for businesses currently available for sale 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows  operating trends  discount rates  control premiums  and other variables of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
given the significant excess of fair value over our reporting units carrying value  the goodwill valuations were not overly sensitive to valuation methodologies or assumptions 
further  a hypothetical change of in the fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in goodwill impairments as of december  our other long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the group containing the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

table of contents valuation of assets held for sale disposal groups classified as held for sale were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and were not depreciated or amortized 
classification of our disposal groups as held for sale occurred when sufficient authority to sell the disposal group had been obtained  the disposal group was available for immediate sale  an active program to sell the disposal group had been initiated and its sale was probable within one year 
if at any time these criteria were no longer met  the disposal group would have been reclassified as held and used 
we evaluated the held for sale classification and the fair value of such disposal groups at each reporting period 
the fair value of assets held for sale was determined considering active bids from potential buyers and also using the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
the fair value analysis using the income  market and transaction approach for assets held for sale was similar to the fair value analysis of reporting units for goodwill impairment described above and required significant judgment 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and one time severance costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
severance costs associated with our standard restructuring plans are recorded once the costs are determined to be both probable and estimable 
excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
fair value of financial instruments our junior subordinated convertible debenture due the convertible debentures have contingent interest payments that are required to be accounted for separately from the debt instrument and marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize a valuation model based on simulations of stock prices  interest rates  credit ratings and bond prices to estimate the value of the derivative 
the inputs to the model include risk adjusted interest rates  volatility and average yield curve observations and stock price 
several significant inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service and or performance condition 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those 
table of contents estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we use the monte carlo simulation option pricing model to determine the fair value of market based awards 
the monte carlo simulation option pricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the black scholes model  however  it also further incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 
if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the stock based compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss  net income loss and net income loss per share 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal  state  and international tax audits 
we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

the slower growth rate in domain name registrations is primarily due to the impact of the macro economic environment 
however  we started seeing improved revenue growth rates towards the end of resulting from an increase in new domain name registrations and renewals

authentication services our authentication services revenues are derived from our business authentication services and user authentication services 

table of contents business authentication services revenues related to our business authentication services are derived from licensing and service fees charged to our customers for the issuance of ssl certificates that authenticate their identity to the third parties with whom they carry out secured transactions 
revenues in business authentication services are related to fees charged per certificate  which are based upon a number of factors  including i the brand name under which the certificate is issued  which determines the level of encryption and rigor of authentication  ii the number of servers authenticated  and iii the duration of the certification 
we issue ssl certificates for periods ranging from one to five years 
the average certification issued by our business authentication services business is approximately sixteen months 
the following table compares the approximate installed base of ssl certificates in our business authentication services and annualized average unit revenue aur for the installed base of ssl certificates december  change december  change december  installed base of ssl certificates annualized aur annualized aur represents business authentication services revenues recorded for the period  excluding revenues from our affiliates and our majority owned subsidiary verisign japan  over the installed base of ssl certificates as of the end of the corresponding period 
the installed base includes all ssl certificates including our affiliates and verisign japan 
during  the growth in the number of installed base of ssl certificates was primarily driven by continued growth in e commerce  communication  and interactions for websites 
our installed base of ssl certificates from our geotrust and thawte brands increased at a higher rate than our higher priced verisign brand  and as a result  our annualized aur decreased compared to prior periods 
we expect that the number of our ssl certificates issued will continue to increase at a higher rate than the revenues recognized from our business authentication services in as compared to as we have a market share leadership position at the high end of the ssl certificates market  our unit growth rate for the high end is limited by the overall segment growth 
in the mid and low segments  we expect to see good growth opportunities for market share gains as these markets are growing faster than the high end market 
we expect revenues to remain consistent in as compared to user authentication services revenues related to our user authentication services are derived from one time credential sales to customers seeking network services and one time set up fees 
we also charge an annual service fee based upon the number of individual users authorized by the customer to access its network and a customer support fee 
we expect user authentication services revenues to continue to grow in primarily from growth in our pki services driven by increased sales to our existing customers and demand from new customers 
our authentication services revenues increased by million in  as compared to  primarily due to a year over year increase in the installed base of ssl certificates  although this increase was offset by a decline in annualized aur  and increased demand for our managed pki services

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  and other general operating expenses  as well as payments related to taxes and facilities 
compared to cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues  including decreased revenues from discontinued operations  coupled with the timing of receipts from customers  and a decrease in interest income that resulted from investments in lower interest rate securities and an increase in income tax payment resulting from higher pre tax income in the decrease in cash receipts was partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from lower average headcount in compared to cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers resulting from an increase in consolidated revenues  inclusive of revenues from discontinued operations  coupled with an increase in cash collections from customers due to an improved collection process implemented in the increase in cash receipts was partially offset by an increase in payments for interest on our convertible debentures  and a decrease in interest income received due to lower average invested cash balances and lower interest rates in net cash provided by investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses  timing of purchases  maturities and sales of investments  purchases of property and equipment  and investments in unconsolidated entities 
compared to net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses  and an increase in distributions received from the primary fund and the international fund in the increase is partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in our mountain view  california location in and proceeds received upon the termination of the trust established for our directors and officers liability self insurance coverage in 
table of contents compared to net cash provided by investing activities decreased primarily due to the reclassification of certain cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in  because of liquidity concerns  the company reclassified its actively traded money market investments in the primary fund and the international fund from cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the decrease is also due to lower cash proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and cash spent on our acquisition of the global name registry business 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of certain businesses  proceeds received from the sale of certain property and equipment related to a portion of our mountain view facility and the termination of the trust established for our director s and officer s liability self insurance coverage and lower cash spent on purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in provided by financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations  as well as stock repurchases and stock option exercise activities 
compared to net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in stock repurchases offset by a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan and a decrease in excess tax benefits on stock based compensation 
compared to net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to stock repurchases in without corresponding proceeds from financing activities  as compared to when stock repurchases were primarily funded by proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible debentures 
the remaining increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases in and a decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan 
we believe existing cash and cash equivalents  together with funds generated from operations and the availability of financing  if necessary  from our facility should be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next months 
our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses  related acquisitions  and share repurchases 
we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during  and property and equipment expenditures our planned property and equipment expenditures for are anticipated to be in the range of million to million and will primarily be focused on productivity  cost improvement and market development initiatives for our is segment

tv agreement convertible debentures principal and interest total as of december   we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through we enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors 
our significant purchase obligations primarily consist of firm commitments with telecommunication carriers and other service providers 
we do not have any significant purchase obligations beyond we have entered into agreements with the buyers of certain divested businesses  for which we continue to be responsible for certain contingent liabilities and transition services after the divestitures 
we might incur costs and expenses associated with the resolution of these contingent liabilities 
in addition  the transition services may be required for periods longer than initially anticipated by management and may be costlier to complete when compared to the payments that will be received from the buyers for these transition services 
in  we issued billion principal amount of convertible debentures 
we will pay cash interest semiannually to the holders of the convertible debentures on february and august of each year until maturity 
we paid interest of million on the convertible debentures in both and in  we entered into a contractual agreement with icann to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the 
com top level domain through november  under the agreement  we paid icann fixed registry level fees of million in and million in beginning in  the agreement provides for contingent payments upon meeting certain criteria based on growth in the number of annual domain name registrations 
we have met the criteria  and as a result  our contractual payments will increase to the amounts as listed in the table above for the respective future periods 
in  we entered into an amended contractual agreement with the government of tuvalu to be the sole registry operator for 
tv domain names through december  pursuant to the terms of this agreement  in and in  we paid the tuvalu government a total of million annually in registry fees 
we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly 
due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements

stock options and restricted stock units grants of stock options and or restricted stock units are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we recognize that options and restricted stock units dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock units granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year  calculated as the average annualized new options and restricted stock units granted  net of options and restricted stock units forfeited by employees during the calculation period for example  upon leaving the company  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
at december   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding options and restricted stock units  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options and restricted stock units where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all restricted stock units vest and are settled 
at december   of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants of stock options and restricted stock units before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and restricted stock unit programs  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 
options and restricted stock units activity from through is summarized as follows shares in millions options and restricted stock units outstanding at december  options and restricted stock units granted from through options exercised and restricted stock units settled from through forfeitures  cancellations and expiration from through options and restricted stock units outstanding at december  average annualized options and restricted stock units granted  net of forfeitures average annualized stock repurchases shares outstanding at december  basic weighted average shares outstanding from through options and restricted stock units outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at december  in the money options and restricted stock units outstanding based on our december  price as a percent of shares outstanding at december  weighted average annualized options and restricted stock units granted  net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases  as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from through weighted average annualized options and restricted stock units granted  net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases  as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from through

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and market risks 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we invest our cash primarily in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds 
foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
as of december   our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations was not significant 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would result in a decrease increase in income of approximately million 
however  this would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 

table of contents market risk management the fair market value of the convertible debentures issued by us and due august  is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately billion  based on quoted market prices 
the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk 
generally  the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures
