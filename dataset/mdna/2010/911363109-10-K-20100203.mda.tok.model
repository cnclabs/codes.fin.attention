item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states  canada and mexico 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because  as a larger company  we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors 
these advantages include greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment  and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 
we offer approximately  classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners  government entities and others 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of used rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
in  equipment rental revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
as expected  and consistent with the recent decline in non residential construction activity  was challenging for both our company and the us equipment rental industry 
in particular  and as discussed elsewhere in this report  because of this environment  we have experienced deterioration in the prices we charge our customers rental rates  the utilization of our equipment  and the gross margins we realize from the sale of used equipment 
as a consequence  our revenues and profitability have deteriorated 
in anticipation of these challenges  however  we have developed and executed a strategy that we believe has positioned us to weather the economic downturn and will enable us to improve our returns to stockholders once economic conditions improve 
for the past several years  our strategy has focused on establishing a superior standard of customer service  particularly with larger accounts  while generating significant free cash flow and positioning the business to grow our earnings at higher margins 
three key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core rental business  the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network  both in terms of composition and management  and greater efficiency with significant reductions in our operating costs 
although was challenging for both our company and the us equipment rental industry  our achievements in pursuing this strategy included an increase in the proportion of our revenues that is derived from national accounts from percent in to percent in  full year free cash flow generation of million in  compared with million in  continued improvement in fleet management  including a record average billion oec of fleet per quarter transferred among branches to deploy it in areas of greater earning potential  a reduction in our employee headcount from approximately  at december   to approximately  at december   a reduction in our network of rental locations  from branches at december   to branches at december   a year over year reduction in cost of rentals  excluding depreciation  of  or percent  which partially offset the impact of lower equipment rental revenue in a weak construction environment  a year over year reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or percent  and an improvement in the gross margin on sales of contractor supplies to percent for  compared to percent for 
table of contents in  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core rental business  strengthening our customer service capabilities  implementing disciplined cost controls  and generating free cash flow 
additionally  we will focus on further increasing the proportion of our revenues that is derived from national accounts and other large customers 
to the extent we are successful at increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from national accounts and other large customers and industrial accounts  we believe that over the long term we can improve our equipment rental gross margins and overall profitability as these accounts tend to have higher utilization levels and can be serviced more cost effectively than transactional customers  accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace  where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage 
moreover  industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand  and is under penetrated in terms of rental potential  leveraging technology and training to improve rental rate performance  and optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness 
although the depth and duration of the current economic downturn has been more pronounced than previous recessions  we believe our strategy  coupled with our competitive advantages of size  disciplined purchasing power  industry experience  superior customer service capabilities and strong balance sheet  has positioned us to navigate the economic downturn in a manner that will strengthen our leadership position in a recovery and improve our returns to stockholders 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report  the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters  and we have not accrued any amounts related to their ultimate disposition 
any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred 
other costs associated with the sec inquiry  the us attorney s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits  including reimbursement of attorneys fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors  are expensed as incurred 
financial overview despite the challenges posed by an extremely weak economy and the credit market crisis  we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in related to our capital structure  and have substantively improved our financial flexibility and liquidity 
these actions include in june  united rentals north america urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes  which are due june   and received net proceeds of in november  urna issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes the percent notes  which are due december   and received net proceeds of in november  contemporaneous with the issuance of the percent notes  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent convertible senior notes  which are due november   and received net proceeds of as discussed elsewhere in this report  proceeds from these offerings  as well as cash on hand  were used to repurchase a portion of our outstanding percent senior notes due as well as our remaining percent senior notes due these actions have improved our debt maturity profile and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantages of opportunities in an economic recovery

as discussed below see goodwill impairment charge  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment 
substantially all of the impairment charge relates to goodwill arising out of acquisitions made between and as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  this non cash charge primarily relates to the impact of impairing certain rental equipment and leasehold improvement write offs 
this charge  which relates to the june repurchase of our series c and series d preferred stock  reduces income available to common stockholders for earnings per share purposes  but does not affect net income loss 
primarily relates to the establishment of a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credits that  as a result of the preferred stock redemption  were no longer expected to be realized

these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time  as well as with those of other similar companies 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda  when viewed with the company s results under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the accompanying reconciliation  provide useful information about operating performance and period over period growth  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

for the year ended december   ebitda increased primarily reflecting the absence of the  non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  the ebitda decline reflects lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment  lower new and used equipment sales and reduced sales of contractor supplies  consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business 
on an adjusted basis  our ebitda declined  or percent  and our ebitda margin decreased by percentage points to percent  also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business 
for the year ended december   ebitda decreased  primarily due to the  non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment  and the absence of the merger termination benefit that enhanced our results

revenues 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenue total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion decreased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decrease in equipment rental revenue  a percent decline in new equipment sales  a percent decline in contractor supplies sales  and a percent decline in used 
table of contents equipment sales 
the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects an percent decrease in rental rates and a percentage point decrease in time utilization on a smaller fleet 
the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines 
the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold  consistent with a weak construction environment  partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 
the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects lower pricing due to general softness in the used equipment market and an increased proportion of used equipment sold through the auction channel  partially offset by a higher number of units sold 
in  based on our analysis of industry forecasts and with consideration given to the broader economic and credit environment  we expect our total revenues to decline further  albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in total revenues of billion decreased percent  compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decrease in equipment rental revenue  a percent decline in contractor supplies sales  a percent decline in used equipment sales  and a percent decline in new equipment sales 
the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects a percent decline in rental rates and a percentage point decrease in time utilization 
the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects the strategic shift we began in the second half of to reposition our contractor supplies business as a complementary offering to our core rental business 
the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects volume declines as we focus on selling older assets  in line with our life cycle management strategy 
the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by the monthly term of days 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
in any given accounting period  we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
for instance  continuing the above example  if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december and returned it at the close of business on january  we would recognize incremental revenue on january of in actual dollars  representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straight line basis 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we had deferred revenue of and as of december  and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off 
table of contents experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to percent of cost 
costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related equipment 
the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues  such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness 
in addition  the salvage value  which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness  is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
similarly  to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual non rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  including rental equipment and property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized asset impairment charges of  and  respectively  in our general rentals segment 
the impairment charge includes reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  as well as primarily related to leasehold improvement write offs which are reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge of is reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and relates to certain rental equipment 
our estimates of the impairment charges for the rental fleet were calculated by comparing the proceeds estimated to be realized from the expected disposition of these rental assets to their carrying values 
the impairment of the rental fleet  as well as the leasehold improvement write offs  followed from our decision to close branches in as of december  and  there were and of held for sale assets reflected in rental equipment  net in our consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business  each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets that have both time and dollar utilization below a specified threshold 
we select these assets  which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december   as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment 
as part of this impairment review  we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization 
table of contents levels  the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives 
additionally  we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition 
based on our most recently completed december  quarterly review  there was no impairment associated with these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships and non compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
evaluation of goodwill impairment 
we have made numerous acquisitions over the years  principally during the period between and  which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
in and  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses 
we believe this approach  which utilizes multiple valuation techniques  yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment 
the following assumptions are significant to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are 
table of contents derived using our internal business plans over a ten year planning period that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors  long term growth rates beyond the planning period  we also determine an assumed long term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit s earnings stream is projected to grow 
these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units  and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten year planning period  and discount rates our combined future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 
during the fourth quarter of  and in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we recognized an aggregate non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment 
the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle  as well as the broader economic and credit environment  and includes billion  reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october  testing date  as well as an additional as of december   reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter of substantially all of the impairment charge related to goodwill arising from acquisitions made between and as of our october  testing date  we had of goodwill on our balance sheet and  of this amount  substantially all related to our trench safety  pump and power reportable segment and three of our reporting units within the general rentals reportable segment southwest  northwest and east 
our october  impairment testing indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values  thereby resulting in no indication of impairment 
the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below reporting unit goodwill balance at october  carrying value at october  estimated fair value at october  trench safety  pump and power southwest northwest east the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment related to our outlook of the business long term performance  which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate 
in connection with our october  impairment test  we utilized a discount rate of nine percent and a long term terminal growth rate of two percent beyond our planning period 
we also performed sensitivity analyses on our assumptions  and noted that increasing the discount rate by one percent still resulted in fair values in excess of the carrying values 
we also stress tested the long term growth rate by reducing it to percent  noting that the fair values for all reporting units were still in excess of the carrying values 
we also stress tested the analysis to increase the discount rate to percent and reduce the long term growth rate to percent as well as in several other combinations for reasonably possible scenarios noting that the carrying values were exceeded by the fair values 

table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and tax planning strategies 
the most significant evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is reversal of temporary differences resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet 
we also evaluate projected taxable income over a period generally ranging from one to five years  depending on the relevant tax jurisdiction  to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts 
this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused due to restrictive carryback carryover rules in various states that would limit realization of tax benefits  and our history of certain state operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
effective january   we adopted an accounting principle which addresses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling 
table of contents our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  pump and power 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico 
the trench safety  pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  pump and power segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we aggregate our seven geographic regions the southwest  gulf  northwest  southeast  midwest  east  and the northeast canada as well as the aerial west region into our general rentals reporting segment 
historically  there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions 
for instance  for the five year period ended december   our midwest region s equipment rentals gross margin varied by more than percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
although the margin for the midwest region exceeded a percent variance level for this five year period  prior to the significant economic downturn in that negatively impacted all our regions  the midwest region s margin was converging with those achieved at the other general rentals regions  and  given management s focus on cost cutting  improved processes and fleet sharing  we expect further convergence going forward 
although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate  to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge  we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments 
any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 
our revenues  operating results  and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers  with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter

the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce  subject to a limit  the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the percent convertible senior notes 
the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately per share from the initial conversion price of approximately per share  equal to an approximately percent premium over the closing price of our common stock on november  however  in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds per share  the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution

the net carrying amounts of the securities are less than the principal amounts due to capitalized debt issuance costs and any original issue discount 
aggregate debt issuance costs and original issue discount of were written off in the year ended december  in connection with the purchases

in january  we announced that we will redeem the remaining aggregate principal amount of outstanding percent senior notes due at par in february our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity  net of of letters of credit  available under the abl facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of cash equivalents at december  consist of direct obligations of aa rated financial institutions 
we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next months 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate  the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment and  if required  borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
we estimate that our net rental capital expenditures  which we define as purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment  will be between and in as compared to in loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility  the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior notes and the 
table of contents quips 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
the only financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility 
both of these covenants were suspended on june  because the availability  as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility  had exceeded percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility 
since the june  suspension date and through december   availability under the abl facility has exceeded percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and  as a result  these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable 
subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility  these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility 
as of december   primarily due to our goodwill impairment charge  urna no longer had any restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness 
although this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings  we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings ability to meet its cash obligations due to certain intercompany arrangements 
sources and uses of cash continuing operations 
during  we i generated cash from operations of and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii fund payments  net of proceeds  on debt of and iii pay aggregate financing costs and costs associated with the convertible hedge transactions of during  we i generated cash from operations of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received proceeds  net of payments  on debt of  principally related to the abl facility 
we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii repurchase common stock of and iii redeem our preferred stock of free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements free cash flow in  we generated free cash flow of  compared to in this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in  consistent with our expectation for reduced construction activity  and a challenging

in november  prior to the issuance of urna s percent senior notes and uri s percent convertible senior notes  and in recognition of the deteriorating economic environment  moody s downgraded the company to a corporate rating of b and placed the company on stable outlook 
both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings  which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies 
our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the non investment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities insofar as such ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor 
there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant

as of december   we had outstanding purchase orders  which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business  with our equipment and inventory suppliers 
these purchase commitments can be cancelled by us  generally with days notice and without cancellation penalties 
the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout and includes interest payments 
this information excludes of unrecognized tax benefits  which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
it is not possible to estimate the time period during which these unrecognized tax benefits may be paid to tax authorities 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
we lease real estate and non rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity 
as part of some of our non rental equipment operating leases  we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero  then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees  however  we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated 
in accordance with gaap  this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 
relationship between holdings and urna

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt  ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had an aggregate of of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  comprised of of borrowings under the abl facility and of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the abl facility and ii percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

table of contents the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates  including our subordinated convertible debentures 
a one percentage point change in market interest rates as of december  would change the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately four percent 
for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt  see notes see fair value of financial instruments and to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings 
we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december  we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
equity price risk 
in connection with the november issuance of aggregate principal amount of percent convertible senior notes  holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties 
the convertible note hedge transactions cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments  million shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce  subject to a limit  the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the percent convertible notes 
the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately per share  equal to an approximately percent premium over the closing price of our common stock on november  however  in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds per share  the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution 
for example  if  at the time of exercise of the conversion right  the price of our common stock was or per share  on a net basis  we would issue million or million shares  respectively
