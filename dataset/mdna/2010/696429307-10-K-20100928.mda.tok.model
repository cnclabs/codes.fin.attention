c non cash working capital at july  has been impacted by the adoption of accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
consistent with the provisions of this guidance  the company has reclassified certain tax related assets and liabilities from current to non current 
such reclassifications had the effect of increasing non cash working capital at july  by approximately item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k 
the discussion under the subheading review of operating segments below is in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year unless otherwise indicated 
company management considers local currency change to be an important measure because by excluding the impact of volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume change is clearer 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the company utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial information as well as to quantify the impact o f various significant factors that contribute to the changes in the company s periodic results included in the discussion below

all statements regarding future performance  earnings projections  earnings guidance  management s expectations about its future cash needs and effective tax rate  and other future events or developments are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other relev ant factors 
they are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ materially from those envisaged by the company s forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in part i item a

the company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure and undertakes no obligation to update them  whether as a result of new information  future developments or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on company management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses the company s critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that requi re judgment 
see also the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding the company s accounting policies 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and appropriate segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the peri od in which a final determination is made 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of the future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while company management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company performs detailed impairment testing for goodwill at least annually during the company s fiscal third quarter  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
the company s two reportable operating segments  life sciences and industrial  are also deemed to be its reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  the overall fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the event that the overall fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the b ook value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the overall fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of march  and march  the estimated fair values of both the life sciences and industrial reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units  and as such  step two was not performed 
the company reorganized its operating segments  such that the food beverage market  previously managed by and reported in the industrial segment  is now managed by and reported in the life sciences segment 
the reorganization was effective may  as a result of this reorganization the company re performed the goodwill impairment test as of may  on both a pre and post reorganization basis 
the estimated fair values of both the life sciences and industrial reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units  and as such  step two was not performed 
when testing for impairment  the company uses significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair values of its reporting units 
fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using market multiples derived from trailing twelve month revenue  earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  of publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the company s reporting units 
these various market multiples are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to determine a range of fair values for the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting units is then determined using the average of the fair values derived from the minimum and median market multiples 
the min imum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
to further substantiate the reasonableness of the fair value of its reporting units  the company compares enterprise value outstanding shares multiplied by the closing market price per share  plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents to the aggregate fair value of its reporting units 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled  except for certain long term contracts  whereby revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method see below 
transfer of title and risk of loss occurs when the product is delivered in accordance with the contractual shipping terms 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i the company has previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  revenue is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts company management evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  company management records in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the factors used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the company s expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when company management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
company management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether company management intends to retain the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
defined benefit retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing marke t and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense and pension assets liabilities recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with the company s defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for ea ch of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies company management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
segment and market reorganization effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reorganized its operating segments and markets in order to better align its technologies  market channel and management to customer needs 
the changes are as follows the food beverage market is now integrated within the life sciences segment 
it was previously managed by the industrial segment and reported within the energy  water and process technologies market ewpt 
the aerospace transportation market has been renamed aeropower 
aeropower now includes industrial manufacturing  previously reported as part of ewpt  which was combined with transportation to form the machinery equipment submarket 
the power generation  fuels chemicals and municipal water submarkets remaining within ewpt are now being reported as energy water 
segment and market information for prior periods has been restated to reflect these changes 
all discussions and amounts reported in this report are based on the reorganized segment and market structure 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales in fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates used to translate foreign subsidiary results into us dollars increased reported sales by  primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen jpy  australian dollar  euro  korean won  and canadian dollar

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal year increased by  or an increase of  or  in local currency 
sg a in local currency in life sciences and industrial increased  while corporate sg a was down 
the overall increase in sg a in local currency reflects the impact of strategic and structural investments and company wide inflationary increases in payroll and employee benefit costs partly offset by cost savings resulting from headcount reductions in the industrial segment and reductions in discretionary spending company wide 
the strategic and structural investments made include costs incurred for changes in sales channels from distribution to direct that primarily impacted the life sciences segment  costs related to the establishment of the life sciences european headquarters in switzerland  costs related to the purchase of a biotechnology company  geographic expansion in latin america  middle east and asia  primarily impacting industrial  and investments in information technology  impacting both life sciences and industrial 
it is estimated that these strategic and structural investments accounted for approximately of the local currency increase in sg a

in fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring and other charges rotc of  rotc in the year was primarily comprised of severance and other costs related to the company s on going cost reduction initiatives and an increase to previously established environmental reserves 
in fiscal year  the company recorded rotc of  rotc in the year was primarily comprised of severance and other costs related to the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives  a charge to write off in process r d acquired in the acquisition of genesystems  sa  a charge primarily for the other than temporary diminution in value of certain equity investment securities held by the company s benefits protection trust  a charge for the impairment of capitalized software  increases to previously established environmental reserves  net of receipt of an insurance claim payment  and legal and other professional fees in connection with the federal securities class actions  shareholder derivative lawsuits and other proceedings see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  net of receipt of insurance claim payments 
such charges were partly offset by the reversal of excess restructuring reserves that were previously recorded in the company s consolidated statements of earnings in fiscal years and the details of rotc for the years ended july  and july  as well as the activity related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in those years can be found in note  restructuring and other charges  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal year  the company refinanced most of its long term debt  which included the redemption of its  senior notes due august  the prior notes 
in connection with the redemption of these notes as well as the termination of the company s  revolving credit facility due in fiscal year the prior facility  the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling  primarily comprised of a redemption premium and the write off of other deferred financing costs

excluding these items  net interest expense decreased  compared to fiscal year  reflecting the repayment of higher interest bearing foreign debt in fiscal year a decline in interest income  related to lower interest rates  partly offset the above 
in fiscal year  the company s effective tax rate was as compared to in fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of foreign tax audits  partially offset by tax costs associated with the establishment of the company s european headquarters and a higher effective tax rate related to the mix of foreign earnings 
for the year ended july   the effective tax rate varied from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefits of foreign operations and the resolution of foreign tax audits resulting in the recognition of  of income tax benefit 
for the year ended july   the effective tax rate varied from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefits related to foreign operations  the repatriation of foreign earnings  the restructuring of certain foreign operations  the retroactive extension of the federal research credit provided for in the emergency economic stabilization act of and the favorable resolution of a tax audit 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or per share in fiscal year in summary  the increase in net earnings and earnings per share reflect the increase in ebit  the decline in net interest expense and a decrease in the effective tax rate

sales in the pharmaceuticals submarket  which represented approximately of total life sciences sales  increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the growth reflects an increase in consumables sales of all geographies contributing  partly offset by a decline in systems sales of 
consumables sales growth was driven by increased demand in the vaccine marketplace and the use of the company s single use processing technologies 
the western hemisphere also benefited from a change in route to market from distributor to direct 
in addition to growth in india and korea  asia also benefited from strong growth in china as drug producers are increasingly adopting federal drug administration manufacturing standards to facilitate exporting their products to the us and europe 
the decline in systems sales reflects a slowdown in capital investments by customers in the first half of fiscal year growth in the laboratory submarket in all geographies  which represented less than of life sciences sales  contributed to growth in the biopharmaceuticals market as well

industrial sales represented approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the energy water market sells process related products to producers of fuels chemicals  municipal water  and power generation 
the sales results by the submarkets that comprise the energy water market are discussed below sales in the fuels chemicals submarkets  which represented approximately of total industrial sales  were down reflecting a decrease in demand in the chemical and refining sectors 
sales in the oil gas and alternative energy sectors grew  partly mitigating this impact 
consumables sales decreased all geographies were down  while systems sales declined western hemisphere and europe were down 
municipal water submarket sales  which represented slightly less than of total industrial sales  decreased 
by geography  sales in the western hemisphere the company s largest municipal water geographic market were down about  while sales in europe and asia were down and  respectively 
the overall sales decline in the year reflects the slowing of orders in fiscal year order to shipment in the municipal water submarket can be one to two years 
europe was also negatively impacted by a reduction in publicly funded projects related to the fiscal challenges of local governments and overall weak economic conditions in the region 
order activity has been strong in fiscal year in the western hemisphere 
as a result  overall backlog increased over at july  compared to july  sales in the power generation submarket  which represented less than of total industrial sales  increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as growth in asia  fueled by demand in the wind turbine market  was offset by declines in the western hemisphere and europe related to weakness in the turbo machinery sector in light of reduced demand for power 
the aeropower market is comprised of sales of air  water  lubrication  fuel and machinery and hydraulic protection products to oem manufacturers and end user customers in military and commercial aerospace as well as in the machinery equipment submarkets  which consist of a grouping of producers of mobile equipment and trucks  pulp and paper  mining  automotive and metals 
the sales results by the submarkets that comprise aeropower are discussed below sales to the military aerospace submarket  which represented slightly less than of total industrial sales  decreased reflecting delay in orders  and projects in fiscal year that did not repeat this fiscal year 
sales to the commercial aerospace submarket  which represented less than of total industrial sales  decreased primarily reflecting reductions in the western hemisphere related to weakness in the regional and private jet marketplace 
sales in the machinery equipment submarkets  which represented approximately of total industrial sales  increased 
these submarkets  which had been negatively impacted by the global macroeconomic environment  rebounded in the second half of fiscal year as customers began to replenish depleted inventories and oem production rates increased 
by geography  sales in both the western hemisphere and asia grew year over year  while sales in europe were down 
microelectronics sales increased reflecting strong growth in all geographies 
overall  the sales growth in the year reflects a recovery in the semiconductor market as well as an increase in oem activity

in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the accounting for business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this new guidance was effective for the company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal year the impact of adopting this authoritative guidance generally impacts the accounting for future business combinations  specifically  certain asp ects of business combination accounting  such as transaction costs and certain merger related restructuring reserves 
one exception to the prospective application of this guidance relates to accounting for income taxes associated with business combinations that closed prior to the beginning of the company s first quarter of fiscal year once the purchase accounting measurement period closes for these acquisitions  any further adjustments to income taxes recorded as part of these business combinations will impact income tax expense

in october  the fasb issued updated guidance amending existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that have multiple element arrangements 
this guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable  even though such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company or other vendors 
this guidance eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
as a result  some companies may recognize revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables earlier than under current requirements 
this guidance is effective for the company beg inning with fiscal year the company is in the process of assessing the effect this updated guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
because the company operates through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  its earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
company management estimates that foreign exchange translation increased earnings per share by cents in fiscal year most of the company s products are manufactured in the us  puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the euro  the japanese yen the yen  the british pound the pound  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  swiss franc and the singapore dollar  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the e ffect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
in fiscal year  the euro  yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  swiss franc and singapore dollar strengthened by approximately      and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the pound weakened by approximately against the us dollar and the euro strengthened against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  company management does not provide such estimated effects and reports only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen  euro  pound and swiss franc denominated receivables and payables 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by opening forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
the company does not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates as of july   net earnings would have decreas ed by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to its financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
the company s debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the company manages interest rate exposure by portfolio balancing including employing interest rate swaps 
the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical shift in market interest rates for fiscal year eg  if an assumed market interest rate of increased to could have an adverse affect on interest of approximately
