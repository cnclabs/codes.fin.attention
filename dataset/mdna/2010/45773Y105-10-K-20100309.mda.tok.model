it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of print and promotional procurement solutions to corporate clients across a wide range of industries 
we combine the talent of our employees with our proprietary technology  extensive supplier base and domain expertise to procure  manage and deliver printed products as part of a comprehensive outsourced enterprise solution 
our technology is designed to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional print supply chain to obtain favorable pricing and to deliver high quality products and services for our clients 
our proprietary software applications and database  ppm  create a fully integrated solution that stores  analyzes and tracks the production capabilities of our supplier network  as well as quote and price data for each bid we receive and print job we execute 
as a result  we believe ppm contains one of the largest independent repositories of equipment profiles and price data for print suppliers in the united states 
we leverage our technology to match each print job with the supplier that is optimally suited to meet the client s needs at a highly competitive price 
our procurement managers use ppm to manage the print procurement process from end to end 
through our supplier base of over  suppliers  we offer a full range of print  fulfillment and logistics services that allows us to procure printed products on virtually any substrate 
the breadth of our product offerings and services and the depth of our supplier network enable us to fulfill all of the print procurement needs of our clients 
by leveraging our technology platform  our clients are able to reduce overhead costs  redeploy internal resources and obtain favorable pricing and service terms 
in addition  our ability to track individual transactions and provide customized reports detailing print procurement activity on an enterprise wide basis provides our clients with greater visibility and control of their print expenditures 
we maintain sales offices in illinois  new york  new jersey  california  hawaii  michigan  minnesota  ohio  texas  pennsylvania  georgia  wisconsin  missouri and the united kingdom 
we believe the opportunity exists to expand our business into new geographic markets 
our objective is to continue to increase our sales in the major print markets in the united states and europe 
we intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets 
in addition  given that the print industry is a global business  over time we intend to evaluate opportunities to access attractive markets outside the united states 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale of printed products to our clients 
our revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and transactional 
enterprise jobs usually involve higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional jobs 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of printing services on a recurring basis  if the client has signed an open ended purchase order  or a series of related purchase orders  or if the client has enrolled in our e stores program  which enables the client to make online purchases of printing services on a recurring basis 
we categorize all other clients as transactional 
we enter into contracts with our enterprise clients to provide some or a specific portion of their printed products on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients generally have an open ended term subject to termination by either party upon prior notice ranging from days to twelve months 

table of contents several of our enterprise clients have outsourced substantially all of their recurring print needs to us 
we provide printed products to our transactional clients on an order by order basis 
as of december   and  we had  and enterprise clients  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  while transactional clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of the prices paid by our clients for printed products 
these prices  in turn  reflect the amounts charged to us by our suppliers plus our gross profit 
our gross profit margin  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is fixed by contract or  in the case of transactional clients  is negotiated on a job by job basis 
once either type of client accepts our pricing terms  the selling price is established and we procure the product for our own account in order to re sell it to the client 
we take full title and risk of loss for the product upon shipment 
the finished product is typically shipped directly from our supplier to a destination specified by our client 
upon shipment  our supplier invoices us for its production costs and we invoice our client 
our revenue from enterprise clients tends to generate lower gross profit margins than our revenue from transactional clients because the gross profit margins established in our contracts with large enterprise clients are generally lower than the gross profit margins we typically realize in our transactional business 
although our enterprise revenue generates lower gross profit margins  our enterprise business tends to be as profitable as our transactional business on an operating profit basis because the commission expense associated with enterprise jobs is generally lower 
cost of goods sold and gross profit our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the price at which we purchase products from our suppliers 
our selling price  including our gross profit  in the case of some of our enterprise jobs  is based on a fixed gross margin established by contract or  in the case of transactional jobs  is determined at the discretion of the account executive or procurement manager within predetermined parameters 
our gross margins on our enterprise jobs are typically lower than our gross margins on our transactional jobs 
as a result  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for our enterprise jobs is typically higher than those for our transactional jobs 
our gross profit for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
operating expenses and income from operations our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of commissions paid to our account executives  compensation costs for our management team and procurement managers as well as compensation costs for our finance and support employees  public company expenses  and corporate systems  legal and accounting  facilities and travel and entertainment expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in as a percentage of revenue compared to is the result of a decrease in revenue due to poor macroeconomic conditions in and an increase in the fixed portion of our general and administrative expenses 
we accrue for commissions when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our account executives receive a monthly draw to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
the cash paid to our account executives in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our account executives earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our prepaid commission balance was million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  we agree to provide our clients with printed products that conform to the industry standard of a commercially reasonable quality  and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality 
in addition  the quotes we execute with our clients include customary industry terms and conditions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects 
product defects have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we are required to make payment to our suppliers for completed print jobs regardless of whether our clients make payment to us 
our bad debt expense was approximately  million and million in  and  respectively 
our income from operations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from a third party to the customer  which is when title transfers 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  principal agent considerations and other presentation matters  we recognize revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because we bear the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  being responsible for fulfillment of the order  taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and marketing our products  among other things 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identified assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we evaluate recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step  the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
as a result of the analysis performed  no impairment charges were required 
as of december   our goodwill balance was million 
asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators exist 
our intangible assets consist of customer lists  trade names  noncompete agreements and patents 
our customer lists are being amortized over their estimated weighted average useful lives of approximately fourteen years over the period we expect to receive economic benefit 
our noncompete agreements  trade names and patents are being amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives 
as of december   the net balance of our intangible assets was million 
fair value of financial instruments we account for our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value within the financial statements in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosure 
asc requires enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements 
as of december   our financial assets primarily relate to our auction rate securities and available for sale securities 
we utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
asc includes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
the fair value hierarchy is based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value 
observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources 
table of contents while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity s pricing based upon its own market assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market corroborated inputs  which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level inputs that are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable 
as of december   our investment in student loan auction rate securities is our only level asset 
the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis considers  among other items  the collateral underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  and the expectation of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
in accordance with asc  financial instruments  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  we have elected to apply the fair value option to a put option relating to our auction rate securities 
stock based compensation since january   the company has accounted for nonvested equity awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the grant date between the estimated fair value of the company stock and the exercise price of the options to purchase that stock 
the compensation expense is then amortized over the vesting period of the stock options 
all stock based compensation expense is recorded net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate is based upon historical activity and is analyzed annually and as actual forfeitures occur 
using the black scholes option valuation model we recorded million and million in compensation expense  including million and million in compensation expense related to restricted common share grants  in and  respectively
