item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of banking services to our customers  with a primary focus on serving closely held businesses in the chicago metropolitan area and the people who own and manage those businesses 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and december  and the results of operations for the years ended december   december   and december  this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
outlook during  we embarked on a growth strategy and focused primarily on lending to privately held businesses  including expanding our asset based lending capability and opening offices in several additional states 
in connection with that strategy  we added a number of new members to our senior management team  beginning with the hiring of a new president in february  followed by the hiring of over new commercial bankers 
together with our existing bankers  this new team of commercial bankers established new commercial banking relationships in and over in we also originated more than million in new commercial loans in and more than million in new loans in at the same time  we repositioned our loan portfolio in an effort to reduce our exposure to industries and sectors that we no longer considered economically desirable 
in december  we established a new residential mortgage origination line of business by hiring a team of individuals with extensive mortgage banking experience 
we expect that the unit will have offices in several states  with production coming from established relationships with mortgage brokers  retail originations and production from our bank s branch locations 
the operation began originating loans during the first quarter of we expect that this new line of business will be a source of fee income for us and provide additional earnings diversification 
in part to fund growth strategy  we raised approximately million in additional regulatory capital in september to fund asset expansion and improve our regulatory capital position  consisting of a private placement of million of non cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock  series a series a preferred  to certain institutional and individual accredited investors and the sale of million in principal amount of subordinated notes issued by our bank 
in november  we also received million from the us treasury department in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b series b preferred and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share as part of the tarp capital purchase program 
throughout  we focused our efforts on improving our operating results by increasing the level of net interest income and noninterest income while attempting to hold the level of noninterest expense relatively flat by reducing salaries and benefit costs and certain other overhead expenses 
we also improved our loan pricing  including the use of interest rate floors in new loan originations  and increased the size and duration of our investment portfolio to take advantage of higher yields 
on the liability side  we continued to strengthen our liquidity position by obtaining more funding from core customers which allowed us to reduce our reliance on more costly brokered deposits 

table of contents as defined by regulatory guidelines  both the holding company and the bank remain well capitalized 
still  the amount of our losses over the last two years  together with our expansion plans and continuing loan losses as a result of the sustained severe economic conditions confronting our customers  have placed a strain on our capital resources 
in addition  we have repaid all of the million outstanding on our revolving line of credit  and we do not expect to renew this facility with the current lender when it expires on march  during the first quarter of  we also increased the bank s capital levels by making a million capital contribution from the holding company 
in order to maintain sufficient capital to act as a source of strength for our bank  to better align our capital position to our peers and to support our future growth plans  we have developed a capital plan that anticipates increasing our capital levels in the second quarter of accordingly  we intend to commence an offering to issue  shares of our common stock to induce the holders of our series a preferred stock to convert their preferred shares into shares of our common stock 
we also intend to pursue a million private placement of shares of convertible preferred stock and subordinated notes 
results of operations we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share outstanding for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  during the lower net loss applicable to common stockholders in was due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and increases in net interest income of million and noninterest income of million 
these decreases to the net loss in were partly offset by a million increase in income tax expense and a million increase in noninterest expense 
in addition  preferred stock dividends and discounts decreased to million during from million during this decrease was primarily due to a million charge in for an implied non cash dividend to the holders of our non cumulative convertible perpetual series a preferred stock to reflect the beneficial conversion feature upon issuance of this preferred stock 
this decrease was partly offset by higher dividends and discounts as had the full year s impact of the preferred stock issued in september and november noninterest income  without considering the gains and losses from the investment securities portfolio  also increased in as compared to  as increases in service charge revenue and other income were partly offset by lower trust and investment management fees and losses from our mortgage banking activities 
total noninterest expense increased by million  or  during as compared to this increase included million of higher assessments from the fdic and an increase of million in expenses related to our nonperforming assets  which offset a decrease of more than million in other components of noninterest expense 
our total assets remained relatively unchanged at billion at december   compared to billion at december  during  while total assets remained relatively unchanged  the composition of those assets changed 
total investments increased million during to billion at december  from billion at december  our gross loan portfolio declined by million during to billion at december   as compared to billion at december on the liability side  during  we increased our in market deposits by million  or  to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  at the same time  our out of market deposits decreased by million  or  to million at december   from billion at december  we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  of million  or per common share  compared with a net loss of million  or per common share  for the year ended december  the largest component of the net loss in was a million provision for loan losses  compared with a provision of million in the net loss in was also impacted by the establishment of a million  or per common share  valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets and total preferred stock dividends of million in the net loss in included a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share  for the write off of our goodwill 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our policies for the allowance for loan losses  the realizability of deferred tax assets and the valuation of financial instruments such as investment securities and derivatives to be critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories  and an unallocated allowance 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including historical charge off experience  changes in the size of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss on loans to those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the current illiquidity in the real estate market has increased the uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may materially vary from our current estimates 
our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have higher potential losses for each loan 
these larger loans can cause greater volatility in our reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate for any one loan may have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans can cause an increase in uncollectible loans and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  our allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 

table of contents income taxes we maintained net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences  the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes  only net charge offs are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of our deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence  if any  of taxes paid in available carry back years and the likelihood that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include a cumulative loss in the current year and prior two years and negative general business and economic trends 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax asset because it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this determination was based  largely  on the negative evidence of a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused primarily by the loan loss provisions made during those periods 
in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions has increased the likelihood of volatility in our future earnings 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange  floor and collar agreements  and forward loan sale commitments to either accommodate individual customer needs or to assist in our interest rate risk management 
all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change in fair value 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of a formally designated hedge and quarterly thereafter  an assessment is made to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that derivatives are not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivatives flow through the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of certain of our derivative instruments  such as interest rate swap  floors  and collar derivatives  are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate market based valuations 
the valuations are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flow of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
in addition  the fair value estimate also incorporates a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the risk of nonperformance by both us and our counterparties in the fair value measurement 
the resulting fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and  therefore  can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the derivative contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our statement of operations 

table of contents valuation of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities portfolio is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires that we classify financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy 
the determination of fair value is highly subjective and requires management to rely on estimates  assumptions  and judgments that can affect amounts reported in our financial statements 
we obtain the fair value of investment securities from an independent pricing service 
we review the pricing methodology for each significant class of assets used by this third party pricing service to assess the compliance with accounting standards for fair value measurement and classification in the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes  market spreads  cash flows  the us treasury yield curve  live trading levels  trade execution data  market consensus prepayment speeds  credit information  including credit spreads and current rating from credit rating agencies  and the bond s terms and conditions  among other things 
we have determined that these valuations are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
while we use an independent pricing service to obtain the fair values of our investment portfolio  we do employ certain control procedures to determine the reasonableness of the valuations 
we validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values by comparing information obtained from our independent pricing service to other third party valuation sources for selected assets and review the valuations and any differences in valuations with members of management who have the relevant technical expertise to assess the results 
however  we do not alter the fair values provided by our independent pricing service 
at december   our investment portfolio includes billion of mortgage related investment securities consisting of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
we do not have subprime loans in the portfolio 
of the total mortgage related investment securities  billion  or  were issued by government and government sponsored enterprises  such as ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
this portfolio included million of private label mortgage related securities that have received heightened monitoring by management because the company believes the fair values of these securities may have been impacted by illiquidity in the market place and a lack of active trading in these securities 
while none of these securities contain subprime mortgage loans  the portfolio does include alt a loans  adjustable rate mortgages with initial interest only periods  and loans that are secured by collateral in geographic areas adversely impacted by the housing downturn 
while the fair value of these securities may have been impacted by market illiquidity  the company does not modify the fair value determined by the independent pricing service but takes additional steps to review for other than temporary impairment 
each quarter we review our investment securities portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable 
our analysis includes an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based upon the location of the collateral  and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we use other independent pricing sources to obtain fair value estimates and perform discounted cash flow analysis for selected securities 
when the discounted cash flow analysis obtained from those independent pricing sources indicates that we expect all future principal and interest payments will be received in accordance with their original contractual terms  we do not intend to sell the security  and we more likely than not will not be required to sell the security before recovery  the unrealized loss is deemed temporary 
if such analysis shows that we expect not to be able to recover our entire investment  then an other than temporary impairment charge will be recorded in current earnings for the amount of the credit loss component 
the amount of impairment that related to factors other than the credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income 
our assessments of creditworthiness and 
table of contents the resultant expected cash flows are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only the specific security and its underlying collateral but also the severity of the current overall economic downturn 
our cash flow estimates for mortgage related securities are based on estimates of mortgage default rates  severity of loss  and prepayments  which are difficult to predict 
changes in assumptions can result in material changes in expected cash flows 
therefore  unrealized losses that we have determined to be temporary may at a later date be determined to be other than temporary and have a material impact on our statement of operations 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income and fees generated by interest earning assets and total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or incurred on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income increased to million in  compared to million in  up million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income for was million  compared to million for this non gaap presentation is discussed below 
see tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins 
during  net interest income benefited from both a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the net interest margin 
our net interest margin increased to in as compared to in the net interest margin increased in as our funding costs decreased by more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
market interest rates declined during and remained at historically low levels throughout since approximately of the loan portfolio is tied to floating or variable indexes  the declining market rates had an immediate impact on our earning asset yields in  which continued in as higher rate assets were repaid and replaced at lower current market rates 
because of our portfolio of term deposits  our cost of funds can lag changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin increased in  as the low interest rate environment enabled our portfolio of term deposits to continue to reprice to the current market rates 
in addition  our cost of funds decreased in as we improved our funding mix by reducing reliance on more costly out of market funding  increasing noninterest bearing deposit balances from customers  and taking advantage of low cost short term funding opportunities from the fhlb and the frb s term auction facility 
during  the interest earning asset yield declined to from during  a decrease of basis points 
the yield earned on loans decreased to during from in  while the yield on our investment securities portfolio decreased to in from in we took additional steps during to increase net interest income and maintain our earning asset yields by improving loan pricing  including the use of interest rate floors  and increasing the size and duration of our investment portfolio to take advantage of higher yields 
over the same time period  the cost of funds decreased basis points  from during to during the cost of our deposits decreased basis points to during from during in addition  overall borrowing costs benefited from our increased use of attractively priced short term borrowings 
our average interest earning assets during were billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during both an increase in average loans and investment balances produced the overall increase in interest earning assets 
the growth strategy implemented in caused the million  or  increase in average loan balances between the two annual periods 
average loan balances were billion during  compared to billion during 
table of contents we also increased the size of the investment portfolio in an effort to increase average earning assets and enhance net interest margin 
average investment balances increased to billion during from million during  an increase of million or 
the increase in average earning assets was largely funded with short term borrowings and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances remained relatively unchanged at billion during  compared to billion during our average noninterest bearing deposit balances increased million  or  to million during  as compared to million in in addition  average notes payable and other advances increased million and other borrowings increased by million during  as compared to year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  million  or  less than tax equivalent net interest income of million during this non gaap presentation is discussed in a following section captioned tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins 
our tax equivalent net interest margin was during  basis points lower than the net interest margin of during the decline in the net interest margin resulted from the decline in interest earning asset yields outpacing the decline in our interest bearing funding cost 
the yield on our interest earning assets decreased basis points to in from during  primarily as a result of the decline in short term market interest rates driving down the yield on our portfolio of variable rate loans 
the percentage of fixed rate loans declined to of the portfolio at december   as compared to at december  this change in the mix of our loans also contributed to the decline in our net interest margin 
the decline in loan yield was offset by an increase in loan volume and an increase in both volume and yield on the investment portfolio 
over the same time period  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during both average loans and investment balances increased in as compared to average loans were billion in  an increase of million  or  as compared to average loans of billion in average investment securities increased million  or  to million during  as compared to average investment securities of million during average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during most of the increase occurred in average total deposits  which increased million in  or  in to billion from billion 
this increase in average deposits was mainly due to the use of out of market funding sources  such as brokered certificates of deposit to fund asset growth 
in addition  increases in average borrowings of million  fhlb advances of million and equity of million also supported interest earning asset growth in tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  we adjusted the interest earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures 
table of contents and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments 
the following table reconciles the tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations

for additional information concerning this determination  see application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets  impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses totaled million during  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the million provision for loan losses recorded in although the provision for loan losses in was higher than historical levels  the provision was lower than the provision for loan losses in reflected the rapid rise in nonperforming and impaired loans and the increase in the severity of the estimated loss associated with these loans 
although we experienced weakness in all portions of our loan portfolio  our residential construction and land loans produced most of these losses 
a decrease in housing demand and real estate valuations contributed to these losses 
while nonperforming loans and impaired loans remain at historically elevated levels  these amounts decreased during nonperforming loans totaled million at december   compared to million at year end  a decrease of million  or 
in addition  impaired loans decreased to million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
however  as we have dealt with our 
table of contents problem assets  the level of net charge offs increased to million during as compared to million in our provision for loan losses decreased in  as compared to  as the level of nonperforming and impaired loans decreased 
since net charge offs in exceeded the provision for loan losses  the total allowance for loan losses decreased from million at december  to million at december  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses for further discussion of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses of million during was million higher than the million provision for loan losses during increases in nonperforming loans  impaired loans  and net charge offs caused us to increase our allowance for loan losses in net charge offs totaled million  or of average total loans  during compared to million  or of average total loans  in in addition  the level of nonperforming loans increased to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to nonperforming loans of million  or of total loans  at december  noninterest income the following table presents the composition of our noninterest income for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands service charges trust and investment management fees mortgage banking  net gain loss on investment securities loan syndication fees other derivative income letter of credit and other loan fees change in market value of employee deferred compensation plan other noninterest income total noninterest income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  noninterest income during totaled million  up from million during the gain on the sale of investment securities in of million and a million loss due to other than temporary impairment of an investment security in accounted for most of this increase 
higher service charges and letter of credit and other fees  partly offset by a decrease in trust and investment management fees and losses from mortgage banking activities  also contributed to this increase 
we principally derive service charges from deposit accounts 
service charges increased million  or  in to million as compared to million in service charge income is affected by a number of factors  such as the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the increase in service charge revenue in was largely due to increased customer accounts and activity that resulted from the commercial banking growth initiative that we began in in addition  a decrease in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances also contributed to the higher service charge revenue 
trust and investment management fees declined to million during from million during  a decrease of million or 
trust fees totaled  during  compared to million during 
table of contents trust fees were earned in connection with our offering of corporate trust services  primarily our paying agent and escrow services 
trust fees declined during because of a reduced volume of business and a decrease in the spread income we earn on invested trust funds 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell our trust business to a third party 
after the sale is completed  we expect a reduction in trust fees  as well as in noninterest expense  primarily in salaries and benefits  from sale of these operations 
this transaction is scheduled to close during the second quarter of investment management fees in declined to  from million during due to fewer assets under management 
during the second quarter of  the third party investment management firm that had been providing sub advisory services to the bank s clients became the primary investment advisor and assumed all portfolio management responsibilities for our wealth management customers 
the million loss during from mortgage banking activities was primarily due to economic hedges associated with our residential mortgage loans held for sale 
in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with these loans held for sale  we entered into forward loan sale commitments 
the loss resulted from a realized settlement loss on matured forward loan sale commitments and an unrealized gain of  on the unsettled outstanding forward loan sales as of december  in addition  during the fourth quarter we sold approximately million of mortgage loans held for sale and recorded a small gain 
in december  we announced the formation of a residential mortgage loan origination line of business  which began to originate loans in the first quarter of although this new unit did not impact this category of noninterest income in  we expect that its operations will provide mortgage banking fee income during during  we recorded gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities of million from the sale of approximately million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year 
the million loss recorded in was an other than temporary impairment of one private label mortgage backed security 
see investment securities below for a further discussion 
other derivative income totaled million during  compared to million during the income in was primarily attributable to recording the initial fair value from the offering of derivative instruments to our customers 
other derivative income in was comprised of  from customer derivatives and million from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges 
see derivative financial instruments following for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
standby letters of credit and other loan fees totaled million during  compared to  during the increase in fees during was primarily due to our expanded asset based lending operations 
our employees deferred compensation plan allows the participants to direct the investments of their deferred compensation in selected mutual funds 
the investment in these mutual funds are assets of the company and carried at fair value  while an equal and offsetting liability is recorded to reflect the obligation of the company to the plan participants 
the change in the fair value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in our liability to deferred compensation plan participants is included in salary expense and  therefore  has no net impact on the company s operating results 
during  the fair value of these assets increased by  compared to a decline in the fair value of million in other noninterest income includes fees from automated teller machines  safe deposit box rentals  fees from insurance and financial planning services  and gains or losses from investments in limited partnerships 
total other noninterest income was  during as compared to million in 
table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  noninterest income totaled million during  a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the decrease in noninterest income in was due to an impairment loss of million  resulting from the write down to fair value of a private label mortgage backed security  lower loan syndication fees of million  and a million decrease in the market value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan assets 
these decreases were partly offset by increases in service charges of million and other derivative income of million 
service charges increased million  or  in to million  as compared to million in the increase in service charge revenue in was primarily caused by a decrease in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances to offset gross activity charges

trust fees totaled million during both and investment management fee income decreased  or  to million in  compared to million in the decline in fee income resulted primarily from the decline in assets under management  which was the result of both the decline in the general equity markets and fewer investment management customers 
in december  we recorded a million loss for other than temporary impairment on a private label mortgage backed security 
the security was collateralized by adjustable rate loans with an initial fixed interest rate period and interest only payments for the first five years 
these mortgage loans are primarily in california and were scheduled for payment resets in mid we recognized an impairment loss for the amount by which the par value exceeded the fair value as determined by a nationally recognized independent pricing service

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense was million during  an increase of million  or  as compared to noninterest expense of million during the increase in expense was primarily due to higher fdic assessments of million and higher nonperforming asset expense of million 
these increases were partly offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense of million  a million decrease in losses on early extinguishment of debt  and general decreases in other categories of expense 
total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million during  a reduction of million  or 
the decline in expense in was largely due to higher sign on bonuses and severance we incurred in as part of the implementation of our growth strategy 
in addition  lower incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits during  partly offset by an increase in base salaries  also contributed to the decrease in expense 
during  we put in place certain expense control measures to reduce salaries and benefits costs  which included reducing staffing levels  eliminating annual cash based incentive awards and suspending the annual merit increase 
during  we expect that our total salaries and employee benefits expense will increase as the result of the addition of the new residential mortgage loan originations unit 
we also anticipate that the number of full time equivalent employees will increase through as our mortgage loan business grows 
salaries  employment taxes  and medical insurance expenses increased million  or  to million during  as compared to million for most of the increase in salaries was associated with an increase in the liability to our deferred compensation plan participants caused by an increase in the fair value of assets held in the plan

the remainder of the increase was due to higher base salaries associated with our growth strategy and the additional hiring that took place in these increases were partly offset by a decrease in employment taxes and medical insurance 
as part of our expense control measures  we reduced the number of full time equivalent employees by eliminating certain positions in the first quarter of the number of full time equivalent employees was at december   compared to at december  sign on bonuses and severance expense was  in and consisted primarily of severance costs 
sign on bonuses and severance expense was million in  and consisted of severance expense of million and sign on bonuses of million 
the higher expense in was associated with severance related to changes in senior management and certain of our supporting staff and signing bonuses to attract new employees 
incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits also decreased during to million  as compared to million during the decrease was largely due to expenses in for guaranteed bonuses  primarily as a result of our recruiting activities

most of the increase was due to the opening of leased asset based lending offices in other states 
furniture and equipment expense decreased to million during  as compared to million in  a decrease of  or

additional write downs and higher losses on the disposition of other real estate owned assets during also contributed to the increase in expense 
the amount of nonperforming asset expense is impacted by the complexity and number of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned assets and could continue to be significant in future periods 
fdic assessments increased in as compared to  because the fdic imposed an industry wide special assessment and a general increase in premiums for all financial institutions

fdic assessments were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
fdic assessments in included an industry wide special assessment to help recapitalize the fdic s deposit insurance fund  which amounted to million

in addition  in an effort to increase the balance of its deposit insurance fund  during the fourth quarter of  the fdic required all banks to prepay the estimated amount of the next three years premium payments 
at december   the bank s prepaid fdic premiums totaled million and were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
legal fees were million in  as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
legal fees are reported net of reimbursements received from customers 
the increase was primarily due to legal fees incurred as a result of our efforts to address the greater amount of nonperforming assets

table of contents of approximately million of above market rate brokered certificates of deposits in the unamortized issuance costs and other discounts on these deposits were written off at the time of redemption 
as of december   we do not have additional brokered cds that we can call at our option 
other professional fees totaled million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
most of the decrease was associated with lower third party asset management fees paid to the sub advisor for our investment management clients 
during  we expanded the relationship with this third party to become the primary investment advisor going forward and  as part of this arrangement  we were no longer obligated to pay the sub advisor fee 
other noninterest expense was million in  compared to million in other noninterest expense principally includes costs for certain consulting and professional fees  advertising and public relations  business meals and travels  board of directors fees  operational losses and other operating expenses  such as telephone  postage  office supplies  and printing

total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
during  we implemented a strategic growth plan  which included the hiring of a new senior management team and commercial relationship managers 
in addition  we replaced a number of our existing support staff 
our recruiting increased base salary expense  cash sign on bonuses  incentives and stock based awards to attract new employees 
salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance expense increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in base salaries increased million  or  as the number of total full time equivalent employees increased to at december   from at december  in addition  employment taxes and medical insurance premiums also increased 
the increases in salaries  taxes and insurance were partially offset by the million reduction in the market value of the employees deferred compensation plan assets 
sign on bonuses and severance expense totaled million in and was comprised of severance of million and sign on bonuses of million 
in comparison  during  severance costs totaled  and sign on bonuses were  total incentives  commissions and retirement benefits increased  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased stock based awards in associated with the hiring during the year 
equity based compensation increased to million in  as compared to million in while we did not accrue for any annual performance based bonus pool in  we did incur incentive and guaranteed bonus expense  primarily as a result of our recruiting activities in we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in to write off our remaining goodwill 
because of adverse changes in the business climate that impacted the bank and the decline in the market price of our common stock to levels below our book value  we determined that the entire amount of our goodwill was impaired and recorded the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents our occupancy of premises expense was million in  as compared to million in occupancy expenses were higher in because we moved our downtown chicago facility from one leased facility to another  as the lease on the existing facility was set to expire in december as a result  we incurred lease expense for the new facility and the existing facility as we transitioned to the new space 
in addition  we incurred costs to physically move to the new facility 
furniture and equipment expense was million in  compared to million in lower depreciation and maintenance produced the decrease in the yearly comparisons 
an increase in nonperforming assets and loans in our work out area caused an increase in nonperforming asset expense in  as compared to nonperforming asset expense was million in  as compared to  in the higher expense included the recognition of a million liability for unfunded commitments under standby letters of credit associated with certain of our impaired loans 
in addition  we recognized additional provisions of  to reduce the carrying value of certain other real estate owned in fdic assessments were million in  as compared to  in in  the fdic increased the rates paid for deposit insurance and  at the same time  granted assessment credits to qualifying institutions 
the bank utilized its assessment credit throughout and in the first quarter of to offset the increased deposit insurance premiums

the unamortized issuance costs and discounts on these deposits were charged to expense at the time of redemption 
other noninterest expense was million in  compared to million in increases in business entertainment  loan related expenses and board of directors fees  all contributed to the higher level of other noninterest expense in  as compared to the increase in business entertainment was due to the increase in the number of commercial bankers

our efficiency ratio was in  compared to in the increase in the efficiency ratio in was primarily caused by the decrease in net interest income 
income taxes during  despite a pre tax loss of million  we recorded total income tax expense of  because of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
additional contributing factors to the income tax expense recorded in included the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to other comprehensive income 
these residual tax effects  which totaled million during  resulted from changes in the deferred tax liability associated with deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income 
this increase in income tax expense was partly offset by income tax benefits primarily resulting from adjustments to prior years alternative minimum tax liability 
we expect income tax expense of million during associated with the release of the residual tax effects 

table of contents since the third quarter of  we have maintained a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as we have concluded that based upon the weight of all available evidence  it was more likely than not that not all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance increased million during to million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in the required valuation allowance was largely due to the increase in our net deferred tax assets and changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance solely attributable to identifiable events recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily changes in unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities  the tax effects of which were allocated to other comprehensive income 
at december   the net deferred tax asset  after considering the million valuation allowance  was million  which was supported by available tax planning strategies 
we evaluate the valuation allowance each period taking into account our inventory of deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those recorded on items included in equity as other comprehensive income  which are recorded net of tax 
during  we reported an income tax benefit of million for the year on a pre tax loss of million 
we recorded an income tax benefit in because of our ability to carry back the pre tax loss to recover taxes paid in prior years 
this benefit was partly offset by the recording of an after tax  non cash charge of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
after considering the valuation allowance  at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million which was supported by available carry backs of operating losses to taxes paid in previous years and available tax planning strategies 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   notwithstanding the pre tax loss of million  primarily because the goodwill impairment charge of million was not deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  during  the state of illinois passed legislation that increased our effective tax rate beginning in as a result of the enactment of this legislation  we recognized a reduction in income tax expense of  by increasing our deferred tax assets 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
financial condition while our total assets were relatively unchanged at billion at december  and billion at december   the composition of those assets changed in during  total loan balances decreased million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at year end offsetting this decrease was an increase in investment securities  which totaled billion at december   or million higher than from the prior year end

during the year  we purchased million of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
a portion of these securities were funded with the sale of investment securities and proceeds from principal repayments and maturities 
during the year ended december   we received million of proceeds from the sale of investment securities and recorded a gain of million 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and when we took advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year to reposition our portfolio 
the overall weighted average life of our investment portfolio at december  was approximately years  compared to approximately years at december  during  our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to billion at december   compared to million at year end in  we purchased million of securities  the majority of which were ginnie mae mortgage backed securities acquired in the fourth quarter of mortgage related securities include residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  and comprised of our investment portfolio at december   compared to at december  as of december   over of mortgage related securities that we held were securities issued by government and government sponsored enterprises  such as ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
we do not hold subprime loans in our mortgage related investment securities portfolio 
although none of these securities contain subprime mortgage loans  the portfolio does include alt a loans  adjustable rate mortgages with initial interest only periods and loans that are secured by collateral in geographic areas adversely impacted by the housing downturn 
while the fair value of these securities has been impacted by market illiquidity  we do not modify the fair value determined by an independent pricing service  but take additional steps to review for other than temporary impairment

we analyzed each of these securities to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
our analysis included an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings  and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based upon the location of the collateral and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we obtain fair value estimates from additional independent sources and perform cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
of the securities with gross unrealized losses at 
table of contents december   only six securities have been in a loss position for months or more  including one security for which we recognized other than temporary impairment during the fourth quarter of our analysis at december   indicated that these six securities did not have other than temporary impairment or did not have any additional other than temporary impairment 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements investment securities from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
during the first quarter of  we sold three of our private label collateralized mortgage obligations for an aggregate gain of  at december   these three securities had a total amortized cost basis of million and were in an unrealized loss position of million  including one security that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than months 
we did not intend to sell these securities at december   but in early  the market values for the higher tiered tranches of these securities increased and we took the opportunity to further reduce our exposure to private label securities 
each of the three securities was sold at a gain 
the other than temporary impairment charge that the company recorded in was adjusted effective april  when the company adopted amended accounting guidance on investments in debt and equity securities which modified the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment and changed the model used to determine the amount of impairment 
under the revised guidance  declines in fair value of investment securities below their amortized costs basis that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as a realized loss to the extent the impairment is related to credit loss 
the amount of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
upon adoption  we recorded the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income for one private label mortgage related security for which an other than temporary impairment was recognized in the fourth quarter of through earnings 
the amount of the anticipated credit loss on this investment security was  upon adoption and no additional credit loss has been recorded since the adoption

currently  the fhlbc is under a formal written agreement with its regulator requiring the regulator s prior approval for the payment of dividends or redemptions of capital stock 
we assessed the ultimate recoverability of our fhlbc stock and we believe no impairment has occurred

approximately of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans  which includes commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  and real estate construction loans 
total commercial loans decreased million  or  to billion at year end  compared to billion at december  although we actively originated new loans during  including the funding of approximately million of new commercial loans  this growth was offset as we repositioned our portfolio to reduce our exposure in industries and sectors that we no longer considered economically desirable 
in addition to these portfolio management activities  gross loan charge off and lower line usage by our customers combined to produce the lower commercial loan balances in during  the implementation of our growth strategy resulted in the million  or  increase in commercial loans during the year 
the commercial loans portfolio at december  was billion as compared to million at december  commercial and industrial c i loans consist of loans to businesses or for business purposes that are either unsecured or secured by collateral other than commercial real estate 
total c i loans decreased million  or  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  these loans are generally made to operating companies in a variety of businesses  but do not include commercial real estate investment loans 
we continue to actively develop new customer relationships and originate c i loans  as part of a larger  strategic realignment of our balance sheet 
at the same time  we began to reduce our credit exposure to certain types of customers where we did not feel the risk return characteristics were consistent 
table of contents with new opportunities in the market place 
this realignment  along with a decline in the usage rates on available lines of credits  reduced our c i loan balances during our c i portfolio did increase in as part of our growth strategy  which focused on the origination of c i loans  thereby reducing the impact of real estate construction loans on our results of operations

most of the increase in non owner occupied was in the specialized other category  which includes loans on properties such as nursing homes  gas stations and convenience stores  churches  and hotels motels 
our growth strategy also produced the increase in commercial real estate secured loans during during  these loans increased by million  or  with the increase occurring in both owner and non owner occupied real estate our real estate construction and land portfolio includes loans for the development of both residential and commercial properties

in the first quarter of  we began operations of our new residential mortgage loan origination unit 
we plan on selling the loans originated by this unit to institutional investors rather than hold the loans for portfolio 
our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit also continues to decline as a result of our decision to discontinue the origination of third party sourced home equity products in at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
this portfolio as a percentage of total loans decreased to at year end other consumer loans were million at december   million at december   and million at december  and represented less than of our total loans at december  of 
table of contents our total consumer loans at december   were indirect manufactured home loans  were indirect auto and boat loans  and the remaining were other personal secured and unsecured loans

demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december  loans held for sale at december   we held million of commercial and residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale 
in an effort to reduce the level of nonperforming loans  we decided to sell certain of our commercial nonaccrual loans in in connection with this decision  during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of a group of loans and also transferred certain other nonaccrual commercial loans into the held for sale category as we actively marketed these loans for sale 
upon transfer into the held for sale category  we recorded a charge off to reduce the loans to their estimated net fair value 
we recorded an additional write down of million in the fourth quarter 
the additional write down was included in nonperforming asset expense in noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
we also have residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale at december  which we had the intent to sell to third party institutional investors 
during the third quarter of  we purchased a participation interest in pools of residential single family mortgages totaling approximately million 
these loans were to have been pooled into pass through certificates to be issued by a mortgage originator and guaranteed by the government national mortgage association  otherwise known as ginnie mae  and sold to third party investors 
the mortgage originator completed the securitization of a portion of these loans in early august and we received payment for the sale of these loans 
however  the mortgage loan originator was not able to securitize the remaining single family loans because ginnie mae removed the originator from its list of eligible issuers  so we took possession of the underlying collateral and are now working to dispose of those loans 
we completed a sale of approximately million of these loans in the fourth quarter of at a small gain  and we are working to complete another sale during the first quarter of subsequent to december   we are currently re evaluating our disposition strategy in order to obtain the highest economic value from these loans 
as a result  we may continue to pursue the sale of certain of these loans or we may transfer other loans into portfolio 

table of contents nonperforming assets our lending officers and their managers are responsible for the ongoing review of present and projected future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  a loan review function independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee about the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level 
the committee evaluates whether the loan is appropriately risk rated and determines if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
most loans rated substandard or below are transferred to a separate loan work out department  staffed by collection professionals 
we have enlarged our loan work out department to effectively handle the increased volume of nonperforming assets 
when the loan is transferred to work out  an independent legal review of the loan documents is performed and current appraisals are obtained for loans secured by real estate 
the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned and repossessed assets total nonperforming assets restructured loans not included in nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets the following table presents loans past due to days and still accruing as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due through days and still accruing days past due to total loans nonperforming loans nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
we evaluate all loans on which principal or interest is contractually past due days or more to determine if they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
if sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest on a loan  we place it on nonaccrual and we discontinue recognizing interest income 
after a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any current period interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
interest is included in income subsequent to the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status only as interest is received and so long as management is satisfied that there is a high 
table of contents probability that principal will be collected in full 
the loan is returned to accrual status only when the borrower has made required payments for a minimum length of time and demonstrates the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
the following table presents the composition of nonaccrual loans as of december for the periods indicated as of december  loan category commercial and industrial commercial real estate secured residential construction and land commercial construction and land total commercial loans consumer loans total nonaccrual loans after increasing in  nonaccrual loans decreased during to million at december  as compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
nonperforming loans at december  were million 
the decrease in total nonperforming loans during was largely due to million of gross loan charge offs during the year  transfers into other real estate owned of million  and repayments and other resolutions of certain assets 
these decreases were partly offset by new nonaccrual loans 
residential construction and land loans continue to be our largest category of nonaccrual loans and comprise approximately of all nonaccrual loans at december  nonaccrual residential construction and land loans were million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in these nonperforming loans during was largely due to net charge offs and the transfer to other real estate owned 
commercial real estate secured loans were our second largest category of nonaccrual loans 
this category increased to million at december   from million at december and million at december  new nonaccrual loans  partly offset by charge offs  resulted in the increase in this category 
c i nonaccrual loans decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  and million at december  commercial construction and land nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   as compared to million at year end and  at the end of charge offs and transfers to other real estate owned  partly offset by new nonaccrual loans  primarily caused the decrease in each of these categories during the level of nonaccrual loans in our consumer portfolio increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  approximately half of the consumer nonaccrual loans are residential mortgage loans and the other half are from our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit 

table of contents other real estate owned and repossessed assets other real estate owned and repossessed assets increased from million at december  to million at december  the following table provides a rollforward  for the periods indicated  of other real estate and repossessed assets for the period ended december  balance at beginning of period transfers from loans additional investment in foreclosed properties dispositions additional impairment balance at end of period during  we transferred million from loans into other real estate and repossessed assets 
of this amount transferred  million was from our residential construction and land portfolio  million was from our c i portfolio and the remainder was divided equally between our commercial real estate secured and commercial construction and land portfolios 
we capitalized costs totaling  to improve certain properties to prepare them for sale 
during  we also received net proceeds of million on the sale of other real estate owned assets that had a carrying value of million  resulting in a net loss of  which was included as additional nonperforming asset expense in noninterest expense 
we also wrote down the carrying value of certain other real estate owned and repossessed assets by million during to reflect a decrease in the estimated fair value of those assets 
the level of other real estate owned and repossessed assets increased during and we expect that these assets may continue to increase in the future as we work through the elevated level of nonperforming assets 
impaired loans similar to nonperforming loans  after increasing in  the level of impaired loans decreased during at december   impaired loans totaled million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
total impaired loans were million at december

the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans also decreased during and totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for losses on impaired loans in was primarily due to net charge offs during the period  partially offset by an increase in the estimated impairment on these loans 
residential construction and land loans comprise nearly half of all impaired loans and comprised of the allowance for loan losses on impaired loans 
at december   we determined that million of our loans were impaired and had related allowances for loan losses of million 
we also held million of impaired loans  for which the individual analysis did not result in a measure of impairment  and  therefore  no related allowance for loan losses was provided 
at december   impaired loans with no related allowance for loan losses included the commercial nonaccrual loans classified as held for sale that were charged down to their estimated net fair value upon transfer to held for sale 
once we determine the loan is impaired  we perform an individual analysis to establish the amount of the related allowance for loan losses  if any  based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based upon the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
generally  since the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent real estate loans  the fair value is determined by a current appraisal 
the individual impairment analysis also takes into account available and reliable borrower guarantees and any cross collateralization agreements 
certain other loans are collateralized by business assets  such as equipment  inventory  and accounts receivable 
the fair value of these loans is based upon estimates of realizability and collectability of the underlying collateral 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the impairment analysis may not result in a related allowance for loan losses for each individual loan 

table of contents impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans  accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal  as well as troubled debt restructurings 
unless modified in a troubled debt restructuring  certain homogenous loans  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and are  therefore  excluded from impaired loans 
as of december   we had four commercial loans  totaling million which were considered to have a higher risk of noncompliance with the present loan terms 
even though these loans were still accruing interest  we report the loans as impaired loans 
in addition  during  we completed the modification of certain consumer orientated loans  primarily home equity loans  with a remaining total principal balance of million  which were considered troubled debt restructurings 
these loans are reported as impaired loans and evaluated for impairment 
at december   we held million of loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
total troubled debt restructurings included consumer loans of million and a commercial loan of million 
the commercial loan is now considered nonaccrual and included in nonperforming loans 
at december   we did not have additional commitments to lend on loans considered troubled debt restructurings 
a reconciliation of million of nonaccrual and million of impaired loans as of december  is presented below nonaccrual loans impaired loans dollars in thousands commercial nonaccrual loans commercial loans on accrual but impaired n a  consumer oriented loans n a not applicable potential problem loans as part of our standard credit administration process  we risk rate our commercial loan portfolio 
as part of this process  loans that are rated with a higher level of risk are monitored more closely 
we internally identify certain loans in our loan risk ratings that we have placed on heightened monitoring because of certain weaknesses that may inhibit the borrower s ability to perform under the contractual terms of the loan agreement but have not reached the status of nonaccrual loans 
as of december   these potential problem loans totaled million  which included million of commercial loans that are current and still accruing interest  but are considered impaired 
of these potential problem loans at december   million were in our real estate construction portfolio  million were in our commercial and industrial portfolio  and the remaining million were loans in our secured by commercial real estate category 
in comparison  potential problem loans at december  totaled million 
the largest categories of potential problem loans at december  included c i loans of million and residential construction and land loans of million 
we do not necessarily expect to realize losses on potential problem loans  but we recognize potential problem loans can carry a higher probability of default and may require additional attention by management 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories  and an unallocated allowance 

table of contents we calculate the formula portion of the allowance by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  residential real estate construction  commercial real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage  and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification for commercial loans and by delinquency status for consumer loans 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example  home equity loans and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  grouping loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates based upon current and prior year s charge off experience for each separate loan grouping identified 
the historical loss rates are then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
during and  we attributed more weight to our loss experience in the most recent two years 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the loan groupings  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
in recent periods  our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on our evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
we review these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  we estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  we evaluate the probable loss related to such conditions and reflect them in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
however  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 

table of contents the following table shows an analysis of our allowance for loan losses and other related data for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans total loans at end of year allowance for loan losses allowance at beginning of year charge offs commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate mortgages consumer subtotal recoveries commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate mortgages consumer subtotal total net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance at end of year annualized net charge offs to average total loans allowance to total loans at end of year allowance to non performing loans consumer loan charge offs and recoveries include charge offs and recoveries relating to indirect and direct auto loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdrafts and all other types of consumer loans 
our allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of end of year loans and of nonperforming loans 
in comparison  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
our allowance for loan losses decreased during as net charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses 
the level of nonperforming and impaired loans began increasing near the end of and accelerated in  and we increased our provisions for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses during in response to the increase in the number of problem assets 
while nonperforming loans during continue to be at historically elevated levels  the rate of inflows for nonperforming loans in was less than the rate experienced in  and we continue to work aggressively at reducing the amount of nonperforming and impaired loans 
total nonperforming loans decreased from million at december   to million at december   while the level of impaired loans decreased to million at december   from million at december  however  as we continue to work through our nonperforming assets and impaired loans  the level of charge offs increased in  resulting in an overall decrease in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents we charge off loans when the loss is highly probable and clearly identified 
during  net charge offs were million  or of average loans 
in comparison  net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  during net charge offs have increased as we continue to work through the increased volume of nonperforming and impaired loans 
during both and  most of our loan charge offs were from our real estate construction portfolio  primarily residential construction and land loans 
in addition  during  the level of charge offs in our c i portfolio increased as we worked through problem loans from this category 
we expect that net charge offs in will remain higher than historical levels as we continue to work to resolve our impaired and nonperforming loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula or specific allowances 
during  we increased the unallocated portion of allowance for loan losses in response to the increase in problem loans and because of the economic downturn  which increased the uncertainty inherent in our computation of the allowance for loan losses  including the expected loss rates applied to our portfolio 
in increasing the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses in  we considered the uncertainty surrounding current real estate and collateral valuations  the duration of the economic downturn and its impact on business conditions  forecasts of national and local economic conditions  concern about exposure in portions of the loan portfolio that were no longer considered economically desirable  and other factors 
during  we reduced the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses as the level of problem assets declined and the formula portion of our allowance increased as a result of the our historical loss experience rates including the historically high level of net charge offs during the past two years 
in addition to the higher loss experience and the reduced level of nonperforming and impaired loans  our considerations in the determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses included  but were not limited to  the current national and local economic climate  forecasts of economic recovery  proactive reductions to certain exposures in our loan portfolio  and our current lending policies  underwriting standards and loan review system 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have higher potential for losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 

table of contents the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions 
while we allocated the allowance to loan losses to loan categories for analytical purposes  the total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from any category of loans

the program consists of two parts the transaction account guarantee program tagp and the debt guarantee program dgp  both of which the bank elected to participate in 
we did not issue any debt under the dgp 
under tagp  all noninterest bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic through june  during  the fdic assessed us a basis point annual surcharge applied to noninterest bearing transaction and certain low interest bearing transaction deposit amounts over  as part of its normal quarterly assessment process for participation in the tagp 
this assessment increased to basis points in the expiration of this program in may impact the level of our noninterest bearing deposits  and we are working on alternative programs to retain the deposits that could be impacted as this program ends 
in addition to cds from our local market customers  we used other sources of time deposits to help fund our liquidity and funding needs 
in october  we entered the cdars network 
this network allows us to accommodate depositors with large cash balances to seek full deposit insurance protection  by placing these 
table of contents funds in cds issued by other banks in the network 
through a matching system  we receive funds back for cds that we issue for other banks in the network  thus allowing us to retain the full amount of the original deposit 
at december   we had million of deposits in the cdars program 
we also utilize out of market cds to fund the portion of our interest earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts that allow the purchasers to obtain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of cds obtained through this channel was million at december   as compared to million at december   and million at december  we also issue brokered cds to support our asset growth  but we have reduced our reliance on this source of funding in the balance of our brokered cds was million at december   million at december   and million at december  total brokered money market balances also decreased in and totaled million at december   million at december   and million at december  at december  and  the scheduled maturities of brokered cds were as follows maturity in thousands within one year after one year but within two years after two years but within three years after three years subtotal unamortized broker placement fees and other discounts total brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and other discounts and are amortized to the maturity date of the related brokered cds and included in deposit interest expense 
a portion of our brokered cds had options that allowed us to call the brokered cds at par prior to their scheduled maturity date 
during  we called million of brokered cds and recognized  of early extinguishment of debt expense for the amount of unamortized broker placement fees and fair value adjustments 
there are no remaining brokered cds callable by us at december  other borrowings our other borrowings totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  other borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the increase in total other borrowings was largely a result of increases of million in federal funds purchased and million in overnight repurchase agreements 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos include overnight and term agreements 
the overnight securities sold under agreement to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
overnight repos totaled million at december  and million at december  our term repos totaled million at both december  and december  all of these are currently callable at the counterparty s option  but million are scheduled to mature in and the remaining 
table of contents million are scheduled to mature in in addition  the repo agreements allow the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to the call date if the bank were to lose its well capitalized status 
at december  and december   subject to available collateral  the bank had available pre approved total repurchase agreement lines of million and million  respectively 
available collateral totaled million at december   compared with million at december  at december   our federal funds purchased totaled million  an increase of million as compared to the million purchased at december  all of these borrowings were unsecured and provided on an overnight basis

under the us treasury tax and loan note option  the bank is authorized to accept us treasury department deposits of excess funds along with deposits of customer taxes 
these borrowings are collateralized by investment securities

notes payable and other advances at both december  and december   we had million outstanding on our million revolving credit facility  which matures march  the underlying loan agreement requires that the bank remain well capitalized and the holding company remain adequately capitalized as defined by regulatory 
table of contents guidelines 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we repaid all amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility in march  and we do not expect to renew this facility with the current lender when it expires on march  at december   we had outstanding borrowings under the frb s term auction facility of million 
we had pledged million of securities and million of commercial loans as collateral for these borrowings and had additional maximum borrowing capacity of million 
the frb has indicated that this temporary program will be phased out in early we believe we have adequate sources  such as fhlb advances and repurchase agreements  available to replace these borrowings as they mature  subject to the transfer of collateral made available by the maturity of these frb borrowings 
we had no borrowings outstanding from the frb at december  our fhlb advances consist of borrowings from the fhlbc 
at december   total fhlb advances were million  compared to million at december  as of december   these advances were collateralized by million of investment securities and a blanket lien on million of qualified first mortgage residential and home equity loans 
based on the value of collateral pledged  we had additional borrowing capacity of million at december  during  we decreased our borrowing from the fhlb due to our ability to borrow from the frb at a more favorable interest rate 
as of december   all of the fhlb advances are either callable or scheduled to mature within the next months

junior subordinated debentures at december  and december   we had million of junior subordinated debentures that was comprised of million issued to tayc capital trust i and million issued to tayc capital trust ii 
each of the trusts is a wholly owned statutory trust formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
each of the trusts used proceeds from the sale of its trust preferred securities  along with proceeds it received from the purchase of its common equity securities  to invest in the related junior subordinated debentures issued by us 
we reported a liability for the total balance of the junior subordinated debentures issued to the trusts 
we reported the equity investments in the trusts of million in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets at both december  and interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures is reported in interest expense 
for tayc capital trust i  interest on both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures are payable quarterly at a rate of per year 
the interest rate on both the trust preferred securities and the junior subordinated debentures related to tayc capital trust ii equals the three month libor plus and re prices quarterly 
the interest rates on both were and at december  and december   respectively 
each of these trust preferred securities are currently callable  at our option 
unamortized issuance costs would be recognized as an expense if the debentures were called 
total unamortized issuance costs related to both trusts were million on december  our obligations with respect to each of the trust preferred securities and the related debentures  in the aggregate  constitute a full  irrevocable and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by us of the obligations of each of the trusts under the respective trust preferred securities 

table of contents subordinated notes in september  the bank issued million of eight year  subordinated notes  pre payable at the bank s option after three years 
in addition  a warrant to purchase shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share was issued for every  in principal amount of the subordinated notes 
the warrants represent an aggregate of  shares of common stock and will expire on september   the fifth anniversary of issuance 
the proceeds received from this transaction were allocated to the subordinated notes and the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
at december   the subordinated notes reported on the consolidated balance sheets totaled million  which was net of million of unamortized discount 
in comparison  at december   the subordinated notes were reported at million  which was net of million of the unamortized discount 
the discount consists primarily of the fair value allocated to the warrants and was reported as an addition to surplus in the equity portion of the consolidated balance sheets 
the discount is being amortized as an additional interest expense of the subordinated notes over the remaining contractual life of the notes 
preferred stock during  the holding company issued two series of preferred stock 
both the series a preferred and series b preferred qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
we sold million shares of series a preferred to private investors in september for gross proceeds of million 
holders of the series a preferred are entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of of the total liquidation preference 
dividends on the series a preferred are non cumulative 
each share of series a preferred can be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per common share 
the non detachable conversion right was determined to constitute a beneficial conversion feature because the conversion price was less than the market price of the company s stock on the commitment date 
therefore  the preferred stock was recorded upon issuance net of the million beneficial conversion feature and then its stated value increased through the recording of a million one time  implied non cash dividend in to the holders of the preferred stock 
during  the company s board of directors declared dividends to the series a preferred stockholders in the amount of million compared to million in as part of our plan of increasing our capital levels  we intend to commence an offering to issue  shares of our common stock to induce the holders of series a preferred to convert their shares of series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
if all of the holders of series a preferred accept this exchange offer  the effect would be that the series a preferred would cease to exist and we would have an additional shares of common stock outstanding 
we sold shares of series b preferred to the us treasury department under tarp in november for gross proceeds of million 
holders of the series b preferred are entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of for the first five years and thereafter 
dividends on the series b preferred are cumulative 
in connection with the series b preferred stock  the company also issued a ten year warrant for the us treasury to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at december   the recorded balance of the preferred stock totaled million  which is equal to the liquidation amount  net of million of unamortized discount plus accumulated but undeclared dividends 
in comparison  the amount reported at december  was million  was net of million of unamortized discount and accumulated but undeclared dividends 
the discount consists primarily of the fair value allocated to the warrants and was reported as an addition to surplus in the equity portion of the consolidated balance sheets 
the discount is being accreted as a non cash dividend on the series b preferred  and the total discount accretion was million and  during each of and  respectively 
the discount accretion increased the net loss applicable to common stockholders and the net loss per common share during each of and accumulated but undeclared dividends totaled  and  at december  and december   respectively 
during  we declared and paid dividends in the amount of million on the series b preferred 
since the series b preferred were issued in november  there were no dividends declared on the series b preferred during 
table of contents before the third anniversary of the treasury s purchase of the series b preferred  unless the series b preferred has been redeemed or the treasury has transferred all of the series b preferred to third parties  the treasury will have to consent to the company paying any dividend on its common stock or repurchasing its common stock or other equity or capital securities except in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the series b preferred purchase agreement

common stock in september  we increased our authorized common stock to million shares from the prior authorization of million shares to accommodate the issuance of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
our series a preferred is convertible into an aggregate of million shares of common stock at the option of the preferred stockholders at any time  and convertible at the company s option on or after september  as part of our plan to increase capital levels  we intend to commence an offering to issue  shares of our common stock to induce the holders of our series a preferred stock to convert their preferred shares into shares of our common stock 
in addition  warrants for the purchase of million shares of common stock currently are exercisable by the holders 
as of december   no warrants had been exercised 
for additional details on our warrants to purchase common stock  see notes to consolidated financial statements stockholders equity from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we did not declare or pay any common stock dividends in during  we declared common stock dividends of per share during the first quarter and paid dividends on common shares totaling million 
currently  the series b preferred requires the consent of the us treasury department to pay any dividend on our common stock 
in addition  under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities and under the terms of the series a preferred  any deferral of the payment of interest or dividends results in a defined restriction in the payment of common dividends 
regulatory capital we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
bank regulators  however  also specifically approved the series b preferred for inclusion in tier capital in spite of its cumulative dividend feature 
total capital represents tier i capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan loss up to certain limits  subordinated debt and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at each december   december   and december   the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
all of the holding company s regulatory capital ratios declined in  largely due to a decline in regulatory capital caused by our net loss applicable to common stockholders 
the ratio of tier i capital to average assets declined by more than the ratios of total capital and tier i capital to risk weighted assets because our average assets increased during while our risk weighted assets declined 
total risk weighted assets declined as we increased lower risk weighted investment balances and decreased the higher risk weighted loan balances 
all of 
table of contents the holding company s regulatory ratios at december  increased as compared to that at december   primarily as a result of our issuance of preferred stock and the warrants to purchase common stock 
this increase in capital was partly offset by an increase in both risk weighted assets and average assets 
at each of december   december   and december   the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
the bank s total and tier i capital to risk weighted asset ratios increased during primarily due to the decrease in risk weighted assets caused by a shift in the composition of assets towards the lower risk weighted investment balances from the higher risk weighted loan balances 
this increase was partly offset by a decrease in the bank s regulatory capital during  as the bank s net loss was partly offset by a million capital contribution 
the bank s tier i capital to average asset ratio declined in  due to both an increase in average assets and the decrease in regulatory capital 
during  all of the bank s capital ratios decreased as the increase in risk weighted assets and average assets outpaced the increase in regulatory capital 
regulatory capital increased in as a result of capital injections from the holding company of million and the issuance of subordinated debt and common stock warrants for million 
the subordinated debt qualifies as tier ii capital under regulatory guidelines 
the bank did not pay dividends to the holding company in either or while both us and our bank continues to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory capital guidelines  our regulators could require us to maintain capital in excess of these required levels 
during the first quarter of  we made an additional million capital contribution to bank to further increase its regulatory capital levels 
in order to maintain sufficient capital to act as a source of strength for our bank  to better align our capital position to our peers and to support our future growth plans  we have developed a capital plan that anticipates increasing our capital levels in the second quarter of accordingly  we intend to commence an offering to issue  shares of our common stock to induce the holders of our series a preferred stock to convert their preferred shares into shares of our common stock 
we also intend to pursue a million private placement of shares of convertible preferred stock and subordinated notes

during  we worked to improve our liquidity position by increasing funding from core customers which allowed us to reduce our reliance on brokered deposits 
we also used available collateral to take advantage of attractively priced short term funding provided by the fhlb and the frb 
we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
at december   subject to available collateral  we had total pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines and repurchase agreement lines of million  and million respectively 
in addition  the bank is able to borrow from the frb under 
table of contents the borrower in custody program and the term auction facility 
at december   the bank maintained million of investment securities and million of commercial loans as collateral at the frb with a lendable value of approximately million 
the bank also has pledged million of investment securities and million of qualified first mortgage residential and home equity loans at the fhlb and had a total borrowing capacity of million at december  the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity 
the term auction facility is a temporary program which will operate at least until early  as the frb has indicated that it intends to phase out this facility in response to continued improvements in financial market conditions 
as this program is phased out  we will likely replace this borrowing with additional advances from the fhlb 
our total assets remained relatively unchanged at billion at december  and billion at december  while total assets remained unchanged  our investment securities portfolio increased by million  or  and our loan portfolio decreased by million  or 
during  the mix of our funding liabilities also changed 
while total deposits decreased by million  or  we increased funding from our core customers  including a million increase in noninterest bearing deposits 
we also reduced our reliance on brokered and out of local market deposits  and increased short term funding from the fhlb and frb to help fund the reduction brokered deposits 
we believe that our current sources of funds at the bank are adequate to meet all of our financial commitments and asset growth targets for interest received  net of interest paid  was the principal source of our operating cash inflows in each of the above periods 
management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows

this increase was partly offset by proceeds from repayments and sales of investment securities of million and a net decrease in loans of million 
in comparison  the outflow from investment activities in was due to a million increase in net loans and million of purchases of investment securities 
these outflows in were partly offset by repayments of investment securities of million 
net outflows from investing activities totaled million during  primarily related to the net increases of million in investment securities and million in loans

we used cash in to fund net deposit outflows of million and to repurchase million of our common stock 

table of contents holding company liquidity historically  the primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
because of the net losses incurred by the bank in recent years  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the holding company in or the bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  under which the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
as of december   the bank could not declare or pay dividends to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities 
in  the bank declared and paid dividends to the holding company of million 
at december   the holding company had cash of million for general corporate purposes and to support future growth 
the primary source of cash at the holding company was from the issuance of series a preferred and series b preferred 
in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of our series a preferred and million from the issuance of our series b preferred and associated warrants 
in addition  during  we drew down million from our million revolving credit facility 
during  cash outflows at the holding company included a million capital contribution to the bank  million of cash dividend payments on the series a and series b preferred  million of interest paid on our junior subordinated debentures and notes payable  and general operating expenses 
during the first quarter of  holding company cash was reduced by a million capital contribution to the bank and million to fully repay our revolving credit facility 
we also used cash to pay recurring operating expense and first quarter interest and dividends on our junior subordinated debentures and preferred stock 
after these outflows  we anticipate that our cash at the holding company would be less than million at the end of march we continue to carefully monitor and manage our holding company liquidity and capital position 
in order to maintain sufficient capital to act as a source of strength for our bank  to better align our capital position to our peers and to support our future growth plans  we have developed a capital plan that anticipates increasing our capital levels in the second quarter of accordingly  we intend to commence an offering to issue  shares of our common stock to induce the holders of our series a preferred stock to convert their preferred shares into shares of our common stock 
we also intend to pursue a million private placement of shares of convertible preferred stock and subordinated notes 
we believe that proceeds from this plan will provide sufficient liquidity at the holding company to continue to support the bank s capital position and allow us to meet our recurring cash needs 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts  and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and december   respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect 
table of contents most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn  and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees to the extent not already recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we established a liability for million for commitments under standby letters of credit for which we believed funding and loss were probable

derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to accommodate customer needs and to assist in our own interest rate risk management 
from time to time  we use interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  and interest rate floors and collars to manage the interest rate risk associated with our commercial loan portfolio and our portfolio of fixed rate brokered cds

at the same time  in order to offset the exposure and manage interest rate risk  we entered into an interest rate swap with a different counterparty with offsetting terms 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value of these instruments  as well as any net cash settlements  are recognized in noninterest income as other derivative income or expense 
as of december  and  we had notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of interest rate swaps with customers in which we agreed to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate 
in addition  as of december  and december   we had offsetting interest rate swaps with other counterparties with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  in which we agreed to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
in january  the company terminated a million notional amount interest rate swap that was not designated as an accounting hedge 
we discontinued hedge accounting in december  when we determined the hedge would no longer be effective 
the unrealized gain of million upon de designation  which had accumulated in other comprehensive income net of tax  is being amortized to loan interest income over what would have been the life of the hedge 
from the date of de designation to december   the change in fair value  along with net settlements attributed to this period  was recorded in other derivative income in noninterest income and totaled  this derivative was terminated in january and the company received a cash payment million  which represented the fair value of the swap at the date of termination 
at december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  in accumulated other comprehensive income related to terminated cash flow hedges 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents the net unamortized portion of the deferred gain that had accumulated in other comprehensive income when the hedging relationship was terminated 
during and  million and million of deferred gains  respectively  from previously terminated cash flow hedges were reclassified into net interest income as additional loan interest income 
we expect that million of these deferred gains will be amortized into loan interest income during for additional details concerning the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments  please see application of critical accounting policies derivative financial instruments from our management s discussion and analysis contained elsewhere in this annual report 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  
table of contents alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors and collars  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts can be designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to decrease by million  or  as compared to the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  in a rising rate scenario  our interest earning asset yield would not immediately benefit from the increased rates because of interest rate floors in our loan portfolio 
at the same  time  our funding costs would increase because of higher rates on short term borrowings and interest bearing demand deposits  resulting in the net decrease in net interest income in comparison to the rates unchanged scenario 
at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was million  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
no simulation for net interest income at risk in a falling rate scenario was calculated because of the low level of market interest rates at both december  and computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and december  change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year n a n a n a n a n a not applicable 
table of contents we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing under the different interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor interest rate risk from an economic perspective with an economic value of equity analysis 
this measure is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk
