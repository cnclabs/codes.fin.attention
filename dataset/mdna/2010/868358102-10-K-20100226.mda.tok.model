critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows allowance for losses on accounts receivable these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
an additional impairment in value of one percent of net accounts receivable would require an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and would result in additional expense of approximately  the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  no customers had an account balance greater than of receivables and the five largest customer account balances totaled  the company advances funds for certain of its suppliers to purchase raw materials 
the company deducts payment for these raw materials from payments made to the suppliers upon completion of the related finished goods 
the company had a receivables balance from one of its suppliers located in haiti totaling approximately  at december  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill impairment the company had  of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet at december   prior to the completion of our year end impairment testing 
the company analyzed various discount rates  transaction multiples and cash flows for the reporting unit 
as a result of these calculations  we determined that the remaining goodwill was fully impaired and the company took a charge as a goodwill impairment loss in the amount of  there is no goodwill remaining on the consolidated balance sheet at december  or insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health insurance programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rates used for the company s pension plans of to  were determined based on the citigroup pension yield curve 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the plans 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  and would have reduced the funded status by  for the company s defined benefit pension plans 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for federal and state jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal and state tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
for the year ending december   we recognized a net increase in total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  as of december   we had an accrued liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  and the related liability is included in the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
share based compensation the company recognizes expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights in the financial statements based on their fair values 
share based compensation expense that was recorded in and includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in those years 
in our share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars that fully vest on the date of grant 
therefore  the fair value of the options and sars granted is recognized as expense on the date of grant 
we used the black scholes merton valuation model to value any share based compensation 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate 
the company determines the assumptions to be used based upon current economic conditions 
the impact of changing any of the individual assumptions by would not have a material impact on the recorded expense

this is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted asc as of september  and thus have incorporated the new codification citations in place of the corresponding references to legacy accounting pronouncements 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure the fair value using one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability or similar liabilities when traded as an asset  which would be considered a level input  or another valuation technique that is consistent with asc this update is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
thus  we adopted this guidance as of september   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
