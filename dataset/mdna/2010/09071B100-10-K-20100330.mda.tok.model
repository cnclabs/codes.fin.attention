item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview on july   our shareholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation  as amended  to change our name from bio imaging technologies  inc to bioclinica  inc 
bioclinica  provides integrated clinical research services including imaging core lab and eclinical technologies and services to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and medical device companies  and other organizations such as contract research organizations cros  engaged in global clinical studies 
our products and services include medical image management  electronic data capture  clinical data management  interactive voice and web response  clinical trial supply forecasting tools  and electronic image transport and archive solutions 
by supplying enterprise class software and hosted solutions accompanied by expert services to fully utilize these tools  we believe that our offerings provide our clients  large and small  improved speed and efficiency in the execution of clinical studies  with reduced clinical and business risk 
market for our services we believe that the short term market for our services has been adversely impacted by pharmaceutical companies response to overall economic conditions  resulting in some contract decisions being delayed and major projects being split into smaller components as part of a revised budgetary approval process 
on a long term basis  we believe that the recognition within the bio pharmaceutical industry of the operational efficiency and scalable reliability of using an independent centralized core laboratory for analysis of medical imaging data and compliance with the regulatory demands for the submission of such data will continue to drive demand for our services 
we also believe that rapidly growing recognition of the inherent advantages of eclinical technology to standardize and accelerate reliable data flow from the clinical trial sites to the clinical trial sponsor will further drive the adoption and growth of our eclinical service offerings 
we believe our eclinical services favorably compare to the traditional process of manual data collection on paper case report forms that are more susceptible to transcription and other data entry errors 
our rebranding to bioclinica continues to be well received  re energizing our marketplace reputation for offering what we believe to be best in class solutions for imaging and eclinical services for clinical trials 
sales and backlog our sales cycle  referring to the period from the presentation by us to a potential client to the engagement of us by such client  has historically ranged from three to months 
in addition  the contracts under which we perform services typically cover a period of to months and the volume and type of services performed by us generally vary during the course of a project 
we cannot assure you that our project revenues will be at levels sufficient to maintain profitability 
our contracted committed backlog  referred to as backlog  is the expected service revenue that remains to be earned and recognized on both signed and verbally agreed to contracts 
our backlog as of december   which includes our medical image management and eclinical services  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  changes in backlog for the period reflect the net effect of new contract signings  addendums  cancellations expansions  and reductions in scope of existing projects  all of which impacted our backlog at december  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination by our clients at any time 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
the duration of the projects included in our backlog range from less than three months to seven years 
we do not believe that backlog is a reliable predictor of future results because service revenues may be incurred in a given period on contracts that were not included in the previous reporting period s backlog and or contract cancellations or project delays may occur in a given period on contracts that were included in the previous reporting period s backlog 
acquisitions and dispositions during the third quarter of  the company acquired two companies that expand the range of products and services the company offers in the clinical trials services sector 
on september   bioclinica acquired substantially all of the assets of tourtellotte solutions  inc  or tourtellotte 
tourtellotte provided software applications and consulting services which support clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry 
the purchase price for tourtellotte was million in cash 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we agreed to pay up to an additional million in cash and  shares of our common stock based upon achieving certain milestones  which include certain product development and revenue targets  hereinafter referred to as the earn out 
the fair value of the cash earn out of million has been recorded as a liability and the fair value of the  shares of million has been classified separately within stockholders equity as contingent consideration for a total purchase price of million as of december  we used cash from operations to fund the cash purchase price for tourtellotte 
the financial results of tourtellotte for the fiscal year are included in the consolidated statement of income for the period ended december  on august   bioclinica acquired the cardionow unit of agfa healthcare  or cardionow 
cardionow has developed a web based system for the secure transmission of medical cardiac images 
the software was specifically developed for and marketed to the invasive cardiology departments of hospitals within the united states 
bioclinica will integrate and enhance the current cardionow software and service to offer our clients a streamlined electronic transport solution to facilitate the blinding  sharing  tracking and archiving of medical images for multi center clinical trials as part of our suite of imaging services 
the purchase price for cardionow consisted of cash consideration paid to agfa healthcare of million 
we paid the purchase price for cardionow with cash from operations 
the financial results of cardionow for the fiscal year are included in the consolidated statement of income for the period ended december  on january   pursuant to the asset aurchase agreement by and among bioclinica and mbi benefits  inc  or mbi  an indirectly owned subsidiary of metavante technologies  inc  or metavante  dated as of january   we sold our capmed division  including the division s personal health record phr software and the patent pending personal healthkey technology  to metavante 
under the terms of the agreement  metavante paid us an upfront payment of five hundred thousand dollars  in cash and will make an earn out payment to us based upon a percentage of the gross revenues recognized by metavante for contracts entered into with certain prospects set forth on a schedule during certain time periods in and we will receive of the gross revenues recognized by metavante during any period ending on or prior to december  from the sale pursuant to any contract mbi enters into with certain prospects during the first six months of additionally  we will receive of the gross revenues recognized by metavante during any period ending on or prior to december  from the sale pursuant to any contract mbi enters into with certain prospects during the period commencing on july  and ending on december  at december   we have not received any earn out payments from metavante 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by  among other things  the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  our statements regarding our projected financial results  the demand for our services and technologies  growing recognition for the use of independent centralized core laboratories  trends toward the outsourcing of imaging services in clinical trials  realized return from our marketing efforts  increased use of digital medical images in clinical trials  integration of our acquired companies and businesses  expansion into new business segments  the success of any potential acquisitions and the integration of current acquisitions  and the level of our backlog are examples of such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the timing of revenues due to the variability in size  scope and duration of projects  estimates made by management with respect to our critical accounting policies  regulatory delays  clinical study results which lead to reductions or cancellations of projects  and other factors  including general economic conditions and regulatory developments  not within our control 
the factors discussed in this form k and expressed from time to time in our filings with the sec  as well as the risk factors set forth in this form k  could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such statements 
the forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this filing  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the proportional performance method of accounting for fixed service contracts  accounting for acquisitions  capitalization of software development costs  income taxes and fair value accounting for stock based compensation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue 
service revenues are recognized over the contractual term of our customer contracts using the proportional performance method 
service revenues are first recognized when we have a signed contract from a customer which i contain fixed or determinable fees  ii collectability of such fees is reasonably assured  and iii services are performed 
any change to recognized service revenue as a result of revisions to estimated total hours are recognized in the period the estimate changes 
we enter into contracts that contain fixed or determinable fees 
the fees in the contracts are based on the scope of work we are contracted to perform  there are unitized fees per service and fixed fees with a total estimated for the contract based upon the estimated unitized service expected to be performed  as well as the service to be delivered under the fixed fee component of the contract 
the units are estimated based on the information provided by the customer  and we bill the customer for actual units completed in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
we  at the request of our clients  directly contract with and pay independent radiologists  referred to as readers  who review the client s imaging data as part of the clinical trial 
the costs of the readers and other out of pocket expenses are reimbursed to us and recognized gross as reimbursement revenues goodwill and other intangible assets  net 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually at december st or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting level unit  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
bioclinica has one operating segment  clinical trial services  which is a single reporting unit 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  tax rates  capital spending  and working capital changes 
we consider market participant assumptions in estimating fair value of the reporting unit 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
at december   we conducted the required annual test of impairment 
in  the estimated fair values of the clinical trial services reporting unit was in excess of its carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
capitalized software development 
we capitalize development costs for a software project once the preliminary project stage is completed  we have committed to fund the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended 
we cease capitalization at such time as the computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
the determination that a software project is eligible for capitalization and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by us with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we consider our future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that  in the future  we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged  thereby decreasing net income in the period such determination was made 
we recognize contingent liabilities for any tax related exposures when those exposures are more likely than not to occur 
stock based compensation costs 
we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with fasb asc compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition of this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of the stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if the actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
foreign currency risks our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially increase the operating costs of our facilities in the netherlands and france  which are euro denominated 
a ten percent increase or decrease in the euro to us dollar spot exchange rate would result in a change of  and  to our net asset position  at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  certain of our contracts are denominated in foreign currency 
we believe that any adverse fluctuation in the foreign currency markets relating to these costs will not result in any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event we derive a greater portion of our service revenues from international operations  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our foreign currency financial assets and liabilities primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  prepaid expenses  fixed assets  trade payables and accrued expenses 
we were in a net asset position at december  and december  an increase in the exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  if we were in a net liability position  a decrease in the exchange rate would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure when and as appropriate to mitigate the adverse impact of fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december   there are no outstanding derivative positions

the results of operations of cardionow and tourtellotte are included in the consolidated statements of income for the period ended december  from the respective acquisition dates 
the results of operations for the year ended december  excludes the results of pds from january  through march  pds was acquired on march  and we did not include the eight days from march  through march  due to immateriality 
service revenues were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in our service revenues was due to a full year of pds service revenue for fiscal versus only nine months of pds service revenue for fiscal offset by an overall decrease in service revenues for fiscal our service revenues have been impacted due to the pharmaceutical companies response to overall economic conditions  resulting in re evaluation of drug programs and some contract decisions being delayed 
we believe as worldwide demand for new drugs grow  our customers will continue to conduct more clinical trials in pursuit of regulatory approval in countries around the world and clinical trials service organizations  such as ours  with an established global presence  depth of services and expertise  will continue to benefit 
reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues consist of payments received from the customer for reimbursable costs 
reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues fluctuate significantly over the course of any given project and quarter to quarter variations are a reflection of this project timing 
therefore  our management believes that reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues are not a significant indicator of our overall performance trends 
at the request of our clients  we may directly pay the independent radiologists who review our client s imaging data 
in such cases  per contractual arrangement  these costs are billed to our clients and are included in reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues 
cost of service revenues was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in cost of service revenues is primarily due to a full year of pds costs in versus nine months of pds costs in and the addition of personnel from the tourtellotte acquisition in the third quarter of the cost of service revenues as a percentage of total revenues also fluctuates due to work flow variations in the utilization of staff and the mix of services provided by us in any given period 
we expect that our cost of service revenues will increase in due to the addition of personnel from tourtellotte from the acquisition on september  offset by the savings of million from the restructuring in q sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily due to a full year of sales personnel from the pds acquisition offset by less marketing costs and tradeshow attendance 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in fiscal general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of  or 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal and consisted primarily of salaries and benefits  allocated overhead  professional and consulting services and corporate insurance 
this increase is primarily due to a full year of finance and administrative personnel from the pds acquisition offset by less professional and consulting service fees 
in the second quarter of  as a result of a potential acquisition which was terminated  we incurred  of acquisition related costs and received  comprised of a  break up fee and  expense reimbursement  from the target company  resulting in a  gain on the transaction 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat for fiscal amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions for fiscal and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions consisted primarily of amortization of customer backlog  customer relationships  software and non compete intangibles acquired from the acquisitions of pds  tourtellotte and theralys 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of tourtellotte 
we expect that the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions may increase as we look to continue to expand our pharmaceutical contract services through potential acquisitions 
in the second quarter of  in order to streamline the operations and reduce costs  management decided to eliminate certain positions and consolidate redundant departments 
this resulted in restructuring charges of  consisting of  in employee severance and  in other close down costs 
we have paid the  in the third and fourth quarters of and nothing is left to be paid from the restructuring at december  we expect to realize annual savings of million from the restructuring 
merger and acquisition related costs of  for fiscal include expenses of  consisting of costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities for the tourtellotte and cardionow acquisitions such as legal  accounting and investment banking fees and other due diligence and integration costs 
also included in this cost is  of earn out accretion from the tourtellotte acquisition due to the difference in the fair value from the purchase price recorded at the date of acquisition to december  on january   we adopted fasb asc which requires acquisition related costs to be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received instead of including such costs as part of the acquisition price 
net interest income was  for fiscal and net interest income was  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
net interest income and expense for fiscal and is comprised of interest income earned on our cash balance and interest expense incurred on equipment lease obligations 
the decrease was due to a decline in market interest rates for short term cash investments  we expect this trend to continue throughout our income tax provision for fiscal was million and million for fiscal our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal the lower effective tax rate in fiscal was due to the mix of pre tax income in the us and in the netherlands  which has a lower corporate income tax rate than the us  and the changes affecting state tax rates

the increase in cost of service revenues was primarily due to the addition of salaries and other labor related costs of million  a increase related to the operations of pds 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to the increase in costs of our european facilities  and an increase in operational personnel to support the increased service revenue

working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  at december  was million as compared to working capital at december  of million 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the primary drivers of the change in cash provided by continuing operations is the decrease in accounts receivable and decrease in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of our investment in capital and leasehold improvements from continuing operations of million and cash paid for the acquisition of tourtellotte solutions and cardionow for million 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million 
these expenditures primarily represent additional upgrades in our networking  data storage and core laboratory capabilities for both the united states and european operations as well as capitalization of software costs 
net cash provided by used in financing activities is primarily attributable to a tax benefit related to stock options of  and proceeds from stock option exercises of  offset by payments on capital leases of  the following table lists our cash contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years facility rent operating leases employment agreements earn outs for tourtellotte acquisition total contractual cash obligations we have neither paid nor declared dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

we anticipate that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs 
however  we cannot assure you that our operating results will continue to achieve profitability on an annual basis in the future 
the inherent operational risks associated with the following factors may have a material adverse affect on our future liquidity our ability to gain new client contracts  project cancellations  the variability of the timing of payments on existing client contracts  acquisition expenses  and other changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we may seek to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources in order to take advantage of opportunities such as more rapid expansion  acquisitions or the development of new services 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available  if at all  on terms acceptable to us 
our fiscal year operating plan contains assumptions regarding revenue and expenses 
the achievement of our operating plan depends heavily on the timing of work performed by us on existing projects and our ability to gain and perform work on new projects 
project cancellations or delays in the timing of work performed by us on existing projects or our inability to gain and perform work on new projects could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our operating plan and maintain adequate cash flow 
in the event actual results do not meet the operating plan  our management believes it could execute contingency plans to mitigate these effects 
considering the cash on hand and based on the achievement of the operating plan and management s actions taken to date  management believes it has the ability to continue to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our operating requirements in the normal course of business for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting statements on september   bioclinica adopted fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles  fasb asc 
fasb asc establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead the fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
accounting standards updates will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the codification 
fasb asc and the codification itself do not change gaap 
other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of fasb asc had no impact on the financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance regarding subsequent events  which was subsequently updated in february this guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this guidance set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after june   and was therefore adopted by us for the second quarter reporting 
the adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that we report  either through recognition or disclosure  in the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events  alleviating conflicts with current sec guidance 
this amendment was effective immediately and we therefore removed the disclosure in this annual report 
on june   bioclinica adopted fasb asc  interim reporting fasb asc  issued by the fasb to fair value disclosures of financial instruments 
fasb asc requires a publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods 
such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position  the related carrying amount of these financial instruments  and the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
other than the required disclosures  the adoption of fasb asc had no impact on the financial statements 
on january   bioclinica adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  fasb asc  issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis 
fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance applies to other gaap that require or permit fair value measurements and is to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of fasb asc  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  had no impact on the financial statements 
on january   bioclinica adopted fasb asc  business combinations fasb asc  issued by the fasb to accounting for business combinations 
while retaining the fundamental requirements of accounting for business combinations  including that the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination  fasb asc defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred 
these changes require an acquirer in a business combination  including business combinations achieved in stages step acquisition  to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
this guidance also applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from certain contingencies and requires i an acquirer to recognize at fair value  at the acquisition date  an asset acquired or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period otherwise the asset or liability should be recognized at the acquisition date if certain defined criteria are met  ii contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination be recognized initially at fair value  iii subsequent measurements of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies be based on a systematic and rational method depending on their nature and contingent consideration arrangements be measured subsequently  and iv disclosures of the amounts and measurement basis of such assets and liabilities and the nature of the contingencies 
additionally  fasb asc requires acquisition related costs to be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received instead of including such costs as part of the acquisition price 
the adoption of fasb asc resulted in a charge of   after tax in mergers and acquisitions related expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for acquisitions completed in the third quarter of these provisions were applied to the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
on january   bioclinica adopted changes to fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc  issued by the fasb to accounting for intangible assets 
the changes to fasb asc amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset in order to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset outside of a business combination and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an intangible asset in a business combination 
the adoption of fasb asc had no impact on the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
management believes the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
existing contracts as of december   we had entered into agreements to provide services with a remaining value of million 
such contracts are subject to termination by us or our clients at any time or for any reason 
in addition  clients clinical trials or other projects are subject to timing and scope changes 
therefore  total service revenue generated by us during the life of these contracts may be less than initial contract values 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in high quality financial instruments  comprised of savings accounts  certificate of deposits and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
foreign currency risk in accordance with our foreign exchange rate risk management policy  we had purchased monthly euro call options in prior years 
these options were intended to hedge against the exposure to variability in our cash flows resulting from the euro denominated costs for our netherlands and france subsidiaries 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we have not purchased any euro call options  because our foreign currency needs are generally being met by the cash flow generated by euro denominated contracts 
the last euro call option expired march   and we have not entered into any new euro call options since that time 
as of december   there were no outstanding derivative positions 
under our current foreign exchange rate risk management policy  and upon expiration or ineffectiveness of any derivatives  we will record a gain or loss from such derivatives that are deferred in stockholders equity to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income based on the nature of the underlying cash flow hedged
