the stock markets and credit markets in the united states and the rest of the world have been experiencing significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
as a result the market prices of many stocks  including ours  have fluctuated substantially and these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the credit markets has caused us to discontinue our development business and may negatively impact our ability to refinance our bank credit facility and our maturities of long term debt due and  of approximately billion  at reasonable terms 
there are also current maturities of venture debt due in of approximately billion 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital  including through the issuance of common stock 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us and our business

liquidity and capital resources overview we had million and million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december  and december   respectively 
since january   we have had no borrowing availability under the bank credit facility 
as a result  during  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations and sales of assets  including the sale of our greystone subsidiary  the sale of our aston gardens equity interest and the sale of communities 
in  we intend to sell i our german communities  ii the liquidating trust assets and  at our discretion  iii certain communities and land parcels  of which any net sales proceeds on the disposition of these assets would be split equally between us  the mortgage holder and the lenders under the bank credit facility 
additional financing resources will be required to refinance existing indebtedness that comes due within the next months 
we have undertaken efforts to reduce expenses and preserve liquidity including  i significantly reducing operating costs  ii seeking to restructure the terms of our indebtedness including extension of scheduled maturity dates  and iii pursuing sales of selected assets 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in achieving any of these efforts 
as of december   we have no projects under development and we do not currently have plans to commence any new projects 
we will reconsider future development when market conditions stabilize and the cost of capital for development projects is in line with projected returns 
debt and bank credit facility debt at december   we had million of outstanding debt as follows in thousands december  december  community mortgages german communities bank credit facility land loans other variable interest entity margin loan auction rate securities the face amount of the debt related to the german communities was million at december  excludes million of accrued interest on the german debt as of december  which is reflected in liabilities associated with german assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet

on february   we extended million of debt that was either past due or in default at december  the debt is associated with an operating community and two land parcels 
in connection with the extension we i made a million principal payment at closing  ii extended the terms of the debt to no earlier than december   iii provided for an additional million principal payment on or before july   and  among other items  iv defaults under the loan agreements were waived by the lenders

thereafter total bank credit facility community mortgages margin loan auction rate securities germany venture we own nine communities two of which have been closed in germany 
the debt related to these communities has partial recourse to us as the debt for four of the communities of million million at december   has a stipulated release price for each community 
with respect to the remaining five communities  we have provided guarantees to the lenders for the payment of the monthly interest payments and principal amortization and operating shortfalls until the maturity dates of the loans 
as a result of the violation of a covenant in one of the loan documents  one of the lenders has asserted that we are effectively obligated to repay a portion of the principal at this time 
however  in connection with the german debt restructuring  we have settled with this lender 
the face amount of the total debt related to the german communities  excluding accrued but unpaid interest  at december  is million 
we also had accrued interest of million and million at december  and  respectively  related to this debt 
at the beginning of  we informed the lenders to our german communities and the hoesel land  an undeveloped land parcel  that our german subsidiary was suspending payment of principal and interest on all loans for our german communities and that we would seek a comprehensive restructuring of the loans and our operating deficit guarantees 
as a result of the failure to make payments of principal and interest on the loans for our german communities  we are in default of the loan agreements 
we have entered into standstill agreements with the lenders pursuant to which the lenders have agreed not to foreclose on the communities that are collateral for their loans 
the standstill agreements stipulate that neither party will commence or prosecute any action or proceeding to enforce their demand for payment by us pursuant to our operating deficit agreements until the earliest of the occurrence of certain other events relating to the loans 
in late  we entered into a restructuring agreement  in the form of a binding term sheet  with three of our lenders electing lenders to seven of the nine communities  to settle and compromise their claims against us  including under operating deficit and principal repayment guarantees provided by us in support of our german subsidiaries 
these three lenders contended that these claims had an aggregate value of approximately million 
the binding term sheet contemplates that  on or before the first anniversary of the execution of definitive documentation for the restructuring  certain other of our identified lenders may elect to participate in the restructuring with respect to their asserted claims 
the claims being settled by the three lenders represent approximately percent of the aggregate amount of claims asserted by the lenders that may elect to participate in the restructuring transaction 
the restructuring agreement provides that the electing lenders will release and discharge us from certain claims they may have against us 
we have issued to the electing lenders million shares of our common stock  their pro rata share of up to million shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the million shares at the time of issuance was million 
this amount is reflected as a deposit on our consolidated balance sheets until such time as all consideration is exchanged upon the execution of the definitive documentation 
in addition  we will grant mortgages for the benefit of all electing lenders on the liquidating trust 
following the first execution of the definitive documentation for the restructuring  we will continue to pursue the sale of the mortgaged properties and distribute the net sale proceeds to the electing lenders 
we have guaranteed that  within months of the first execution of the definitive documentation for the restructuring  the electing lenders will receive a minimum of million from the net proceeds of the sale of the liquidating trust  which equals percent of the most recent aggregate appraised value of these properties 
if the electing lenders do not receive at least million by such date  we will make payment to cover any shortfall or  at such lenders option  convey to them the remaining unsold properties in satisfaction of our remaining obligation to the minimum payments 
in addition  we have been marketing for sale the german assisted living communities subject to loan agreements with the electing lenders and will remain responsible for all costs of operating  preserving and maintaining these communities until the earlier of either their sale or december  in  we engaged a broker to assist in the sale of the nine german communities and at that time  classified the german assets as held for sale 
as the book value of the majority of the assets was in excess of their fair value less estimated costs to sell  we recorded a charge of million in which is included in discontinued operations 
the closing of the transaction  including the execution of the definitive documentation  the release of claims and the issuance of sunrise common stock  was conditioned upon receipt of consent for the transaction from bank of america  na  as the administrative agent under our bank credit facility  which consent was received 
in accordance with the binding term sheet  definitive documentation was to be executed as soon as reasonably possible but no later than days after the receipt of such required consent 
in december  we extended the execution of the definitive documentation to allow the parties additional time to complete the definitive documentation 
we expect to complete this process by the end of february at december   we continue to be liable under operating deficit and repayment guarantees for two communities which are not part of the restructuring 
in addition  we were liable for a principal repayment guarantee for the hoesel land parcel which was not part of the restructuring agreement 
the hoesel land parcel was sold and the liability was released in early we expect to recognize a gain of million on the sale in mortgage financing in  of our wholly owned subsidiaries incurred mortgage indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million from capmark bank capmark as lender and servicer pursuant to separate cross collateralized  cross defaulted mortgage loans 
shortly after the closing  capmark assigned the mortgage loans to fannie mae 
variable monthly interest payments were in an amount equal to i one third of the discount which was the difference between the loan amount and the price at which fannie mae was able to sell its three month  rolling discount mortgage backed securities plus ii basis points times the outstanding loan amount divided by twelve 
in connection with the mortgage loans  we entered into interest rate protection agreements that provided for payments to us in the event the libor rate exceeded 
these loans and interest rate protection agreements were either assigned to the buyer of of the communities in or paid off in connection with that closing 
also in  mortgage loans of million were either assigned to the purchaser or repaid in conjunction with the sale of the underlying assets 
bank credit facility in  we entered into various amendments to our bank credit facility 
these amendments  among other things extended the maturity date to december   removed all existing financial covenants other than the minimum liquidity covenant  renewed existing letters of credit  modified the minimum liquidity covenant to not less than million of unrestricted cash on hand the last day of the month  modified the restriction on the disposal of assets to include disposition of certain assets as long as of the net sale proceeds are allocated to the lenders  and permanently reduced the commitment after future principal repayments or cancellation of letters of credit 
total amendment fees paid were million 
principal payments of million were made during in accordance with these amendments 
in addition  million was placed into a collateral account for the benefit of other creditors from the proceeds of the sale of communities 
million of cash was used to satisfy the obligations of other creditors and million remains in the collateral account at december  this amount is included in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have no borrowing availability under the bank credit facility 
we have million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank credit facility at december  other debt sunrise ventures have total debt of billion with near term scheduled debt maturities of billion in of this billion of debt  there is long term debt that is in default of billion 
the debt in the ventures is non recourse to us with respect to principal payment guarantees and we and our venture partners are working with the venture lenders to obtain covenant waivers and to extend the maturity dates 
in certain cases  we have provided operating deficit and completion guarantees to the lenders or ventures 
we have operating deficit or completion guarantee agreements with respect to ventures in which we are obligated for total debt of billion or of the total venture debt 
under the operating deficit agreements  we are obligated to pay operating shortfalls  if any  with respect to these ventures 
any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the venture s obligations for monthly principal and interest on the venture debt 
we do not believe that these operating deficit agreements would obligate us to make payments of principal and interest on such venture debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness 
we have minority non controlling interests in these ventures 
certain of these ventures have financial covenants that are based on the consolidated results of sunrise 
in all such instances  the construction loans or permanent financing provided by financial institutions is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed community 
these events of default could allow the financial institutions who have extended credit to seek acceleration of the loans 
guarantees we have provided project completion guarantees to venture lenders and the venture itself  operating deficit guarantees to the venture lenders whereby after depletion of established reserves we guarantee the payment of the lender s monthly principal and interest during the term of the guarantee and guarantees to ventures to fund operating shortfalls 
the terms of the guarantees match the term of the underlying venture debt and generally range from three to five years  to the extent we are able to refinance the venture debt 
fundings under the operating deficit guarantees and debt repayment guarantees are generally recoverable either out of future cash flows of the venture or from proceeds of the sale of communities 
we have no projects under construction at december  the maximum potential amount of future fundings for outstanding guarantees  the carrying amount of the liability for expected future fundings at december  and fundings during are as follows in thousands asc asc fundings guarantee contingencies total from topic liability topic liability liability january  for future for future for future maximum potential fundings at fundings at fundings at through amount of future december  december  december  december  guarantee type fundings operating deficit uncapped other total senior living condominium project in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in one condominium venture and one assisted living venture discussed in note  we are obligated to fund operating shortfalls 
the weak economy in the washington  dc area has resulted in lower condominium sales than forecasted and we have funded million under the guarantees through december  in addition  we are required to fund marketing costs associated with the sale of the condominiums which we estimate will total approximately million by the time the remaining inventory of condominiums are sold 
in july  the lender alleged that an event of default had occurred 
the event of default was related to providing certain financial information for the venture that the lender had previously requested 
in october  we received a notice of default related to the nonpayment of interest 
we are in discussions with the lender on these matters 
agreements with marriott international  inc our agreements with marriott international  inc marriott  which related to our purchase of marriott senior living services  inc in  provide that marriott has the right to demand that we provide cash collateral security for assignee reimbursement obligations  as defined in the agreements  in the event that our implied debt rating is not at least b by standard and poors or b by moody s investor services 
assignee reimbursement obligations relate to possible liability with respect to leases assigned to us in and entrance fee obligations assumed by us in that remain outstanding approximately million at december  
marriott has informed us that they reserve all of their rights to issue a notice of collateral event under the assignment and reimbursement agreement 
other generally  the financing obtained by our ventures is non recourse to the venture members  with the exception of the debt repayment guarantees discussed above 
however  we have entered into guarantees with the lenders with respect to acts which we believe are in our control  such as fraud or voluntary bankruptcy of the venture  that create exceptions to the non recourse nature of debt 
if such acts were to occur  the full amount of the venture debt could become recourse to us 
the combined amount of venture debt underlying these guarantees is approximately billion at december  we have not funded under these guarantees  and do not expect to fund under such guarantees in the future 
to the extent that a third party fails to satisfy an obligation with respect to two continuing care retirement communities we manage  we would be required to repay this obligation  the majority of which is expected to be refinanced with proceeds from the issuance of entrance fees as new residents enter the communities 
at december   the remaining liability under this obligation is million 
we have not funded under these guarantees  and do not expect to fund under such guarantees in the future 
contractual obligations our current contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases for our corporate and regional offices  operating leases for our communities  and building and land lease commitments 
in addition  we have commitments to fund ventures in which we are a partner 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our commitments 
principal maturities of debt  equity investments in unconsolidated entities and future minimum lease payments at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period more less than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations debt bank credit facility capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities equity investments in unconsolidated entities total we have various standing or renewable contracts with vendors 
these contracts are all cancellable with minimal or no cancellation penalties 
contract terms are generally one year or less 
in addition to the obligations in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
cash flows our primary sources of cash from operating activities are from management fees  from monthly fees and other billings from services provided to residents of our consolidated communities and distributions of operating earnings from unconsolidated ventures 
the primary uses of cash for our ongoing operations include the payment of community operating and ancillary expenses for our consolidated and managed communities  general and administrative expenses and restructuring expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate based on the timing of payment to vendors 
reimbursement of these costs from our managed communities will vary as some costs are pre funded  such as payroll  while others are reimbursed after they are incurred 
therefore  there will not always be a correlation between increases and decreases of accounts payable and receivables for our managed communities 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
during  net working capital provided cash of million as opposed to using cash of million in discontinued operations provided cash of million in as compared to using cash of million in net cash used in provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
during  net working capital used cash of million as opposed to providing cash of million in in  the use of cash primarily relates to the payment of accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
in addition  distributions of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries were million less in as compared to discontinued operations used cash of million in as compared to providing cash of million in net cash provided by used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of million in capital expenditures and condominium fundings  an increase in cash provided by discontinued operations of million as the result of asset sale proceeds and a decrease in investments in unconsolidated communities of million 
these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease of million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and increase in restricted cash of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  a decrease of million 
in  we slowed our development pace resulting in a decrease in capital expenditures from million in to million in during  we funded million for our senior living condominium project  with no corresponding outflow in in  we had no asset acquisitions  compared to million in restricted cash decreased by approximately million in compared to due in part to the net purchase of million of auction rate securities using restricted cash in our insurance captive and due to refunds made to our venture partners from changes to our self insurance liabilities from reassessment of the actuarial liabilities 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of long term debt of million  a decrease in net borrowings of debt related to discontinued operation of million and repayments of million under our bank credit facility as compared to repayments of million in net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively  resulting primarily from million in net increased borrowings 
the significant sources of new financing in were new mortgage debt related to of our wholly owned subsidiaries million  of which were sold in and the mortgage proceeds from are included in discontinued operations  construction debt for one community under development million  and a margin loan collateralized by auction rate securities million 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through variable rate debt 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
the following table details by category the principal amount  the average interest rate and the estimated fair market value of our debt in thousands maturity date fixed rate variable rate through december  debt debt thereafter total carrying value average interest rate estimated fair market value at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
debt incurred in the future also may bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our interest payment obligations  which would negatively impact earnings 
a one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  a five percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  we are subject to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements 
to date  we have not hedged against foreign currency fluctuation  however  we may pursue hedging alternatives in the future 
at december   our wholly owned subsidiaries have net us dollar equivalent monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currency of million  million and million in canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
we recorded million  net  in exchange gains in million in gains related to the canadian dollar and million and million in losses related to the euro and british pound  respectively 
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates than we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets  long lived assets and investments in ventures intangibles and long lived asset groups are tested for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
a test for recoverability also is performed when management has committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year 
recoverability of an asset group is evaluated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss is measured at the lowest level of cash flows which is typically at the community or land parcel level  by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the fair value of an intangible asset  or asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the intangible asset or asset group could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  eg finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings are projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit  asset  or asset group 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business 
in  we recorded certain land parcels held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we used appraisals  market knowledge and broker opinions of value to determine fair value 
as the carrying value of some of the assets was in excess of the fair value less estimated costs to sell  we recorded a charge of million which is included in operating expenses under impairment of long lived assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain operating communities that are held and used as the carrying value of these assets was in excess of the fair value 
we also recorded impairment charges of million for certain land parcels held and used as the carrying value of these assets was in excess of the fair value 
we used appraisals  recent sale and a cost of capital rate to the communities average net income to estimate fair value of all of these assets 
the charges are included in operating expenses under impairment of long lived assets 
in  upon designation of the german assets as held for sale  we recorded the assets at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we used the bids received to date in the determination of fair value 
as the carrying value of a majority of the assets was in excess of the fair value less estimated costs to sell  during we recorded a charge of million which is included in discontinued operations 
nature of estimates required investments in ventures 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
the equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
our investments in ventures accounted for using the equity and cost methods of accounting are impaired when it is determined that there is other than a temporary decline in the fair value as compared to the carrying value of the venture or for equity method investments when individual long lived assets inside the venture meet the criteria specified above 
a commitment to a plan to sell some or all of the assets in a venture would cause a recoverability evaluation for the individual long lived assets in the venture and possibly the venture itself 
our evaluation of the investment in the venture would be triggered when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable due to loan defaults  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating performance and significant industry or economic trends 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions and approach for the evaluation of the individual long lived assets inside the venture are described above 
our approach for evaluation of an investment in a venture would be based on market prices  when available  or an estimate of the fair value using the market approach 
the assumptions and related risks are identical to those used for goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets described above 
in  based on the receipt of a notice of default from the lender to a venture in which we own a interest and the poor rental experience in the venture  we considered our equity to be other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining equity balance of million 
we determined the fair value of our investment in a venture in which we had a interest had decreased to zero and was other than temporarily impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
in addition  we wrote down our equity investments in two of our development ventures by million based on poor performance and defaults under the ventures construction loan agreements 
in  we wrote down our equity investments in our fountains and aston gardens ventures by million and million  respectively 
in  we wrote down equity investments in four unconsolidated ventures 
the majority of the charge related to our investment in aston gardens  a venture which acquired six senior living communities in florida in september in and into  the operating results of the aston garden communities suffered due to adverse economic conditions in florida for independent living communities including a decline in the real estate market 
these operating results were insufficient to achieve compliance with the debt covenants for the mortgage debt for the properties 
in july  the venture received notice of default from the lender of million of debt obtained by the venture at the time of the acquisition in september later in july  we received notice from our equity partner alleging a default under our management agreement as a result of receiving the notice from the lender 
this debt is non recourse to us  except for monthly principal payments during the term of the debt 
based on our assessment  we determined that our investment was impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of loss reserves for self insured programs nature of estimates required 
we utilize large deductible blanket insurance programs in order to contain costs for certain lines of insurance risks including workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks self insured risks 
the design and purpose of a large deductible insurance program is to reduce the overall premium and claims costs by internally financing lower cost claims that are more predictable from year to year  while buying insurance only for higher cost  less predictable claims 
we have self insured a portion of the self insured risks through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  sunrise senior living insurance  inc sunrise captive 
sunrise captive issues policies of insurance to and receives premiums from sunrise that are reimbursed through expense allocation to each operated community and us 
sunrise captive pays the costs for each claim above a deductible up to a per claim limit 
third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above this limit 
these third party insurers carry an am best rating of a vii or better 
we also offer our employees an option to participate in self insured health and dental plans 
the cost of our employee health and dental benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and the communities based on the respective number of participants working directly either at our corporate headquarters or at the communities 
funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs which include estimated annual claims  third party administrative fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administrative costs incurred by us 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
assumptions and approach used for self insured risks 
we record outstanding losses and expenses for the self insured risks and for our health and dental plans based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and management s judgment 
we believe that the allowance for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but the allowance may ultimately be settled for a greater or lesser amount 
any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
while a single value is recorded on sunrise s balance sheet  loss reserves are based on estimates of future contingent events and as such contain inherent uncertainty 
a quantification of this uncertainty would reflect a range of reasonable favorable and unfavorable scenarios 
sunrise s annual estimated cost for self insured risks is determined using management judgment including actuarial analyses at various confidence levels 
the confidence level is the likelihood that the recorded expense will exceed the ultimate incurred cost 
sensitivity analysis for self insured risks 
the recorded liability for self insured risks was approximately million at december  the expected liability is based on a confidence level 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 
we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on sunrise s income from operations would be much less sensitive than the difference above 
assumptions and approach used for health and dental plans 
for our self insured health and dental plans  we record a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
this liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims and is based on the recommendations of an independent actuary 
the variability in the liability for unpaid claims including incurred but not yet reported claims is much less significant than the self insured risks discussed above because the claims are more predictable as they generally are known within days and the high and the low end of the range of estimated cost of individual claims is much closer than the workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks discussed above 
sensitivity analysis for self insured health and dental plan costs 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims for the self insured health and dental plan is included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but actual claims may differ 
we record any subsequent changes in estimates in the period in which they are determined and will share with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
variable interest entities nature of estimates required 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
our equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
we review all of our ventures to determine if they are variable interest entities vies 
if a venture meets the requirements and is a vie  we must then determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
estimates are required for the computation and probability of estimated cash flows  expected losses and expected residual returns of the vie to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and therefore required to consolidate the venture 
assumptions 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we must make assumptions regarding cash flows of the entity  expected loss levels and expected residual return levels 
the probability of various cash flow possibilities is determined from business plans  budgets and entity history if available 
these cash flows are discounted at the risk free interest rate 
computations are then made based on the estimated cash flows of the expected losses and residual returns to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity and  if so  to determine the primary beneficiary 
changes in estimated cash flows and the probability factors could change the determination of the primary beneficiary and whether there is a requirement to consolidate a vie 
effective january   the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc issued accounting standards update asu asu consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu establishes a qualitative approach to the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity that replaces the previous quantitative approach 
however  asu does not eliminate the need to perform a quantitative analysis in applying other provisions of the asc consolidations topic  including the determination of vie status 
upon adoption of asu  we must reconsider our consolidation conclusions for all entities with which we are involved 
additionally  asu eliminates the primary beneficiary reconsideration concept and effectively requires continuous evaluation as to the determination of the primary beneficiary as facts and circumstances change 
we do not believe asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
considering that we will need to perform quantitative analysis for vie determination under asu  we will continue to make estimates and assumptions referred to above 
valuation of deferred tax assets nature of estimates required 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
asc income tax topic requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not defined by as a likelihood of more than percent such assets will not be realized 
the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
assumptions and approach used 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would be required to establish a valuation allowance 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
as such  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
asc income tax topic states that a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets 
this assessment  which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis  takes into account a number of types of evidence  including the following nature  frequency  and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses a pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is a source of negative evidence 
in certain circumstances  historical information may not be as relevant due to changed circumstances  sources of future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences are verifiable positive evidence 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence but such projections are more subjective and when such projections are combined with a history of recent losses it is difficult to reach verifiable conclusions and  accordingly  we give little or no weight to such projections when combined recent financial reporting losses  and tax planning strategies if necessary and available  tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards 
these strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and  depending on their nature  could be heavily weighted 
we have experienced significant losses in the last three years 
as indicated above  in making our assessment of the realizability of tax assets we assess reversing temporary differences  available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income 
we more heavily weight recent financial reporting losses and  accordingly  as of december  have given little or no weight to subjectively determined projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
tax planning strategies have been considered historically but due to the significant net operating loss carryforwards as of december  we have not considered such strategies to be reasonably viable 
as a result of changes in judgment on the realizability of future tax benefits  a valuation allowance was established on all deferred tax assets net of reversing deferred tax liabilities 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  were million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  and therefore the net deferred tax liabilities recorded were zero and million as of december  and  respectively 
a return to profitability by us in future periods may result in a reversal of the valuation allowance relating to certain recorded deferred tax assets 
liability for possible tax contingencies liabilities for tax contingencies are recognized based on the requirements of asc income tax topic 
this topic requires us to analyze the technical merits of our tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities 
if we determine that it is unlikely that our tax positions will be sustained  a corresponding liability is created and the tax benefit of such position is reduced for financial reporting purposes 
evaluation and nature of estimates required 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step in the evaluation process is recognition 
the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step in the evaluation process is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which a the threshold is met for example  by virtue of another taxpayer s favorable court decision  b the position is effectively settled where the likelihood of the taxing authority reopening the examination of that position is remote  or c the relevant statute of limitations expires 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
interest and penalties 
we are also required to accrue interest and penalties that  under relevant tax law  we would incur if the uncertain tax positions ultimately were not sustained 
accordingly  interest would start to accrue for financial statement purposes in the period in which it would begin accruing under relevant tax law  and the amount of interest expense to be recognized would be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
penalties would be accrued in the first period in which the position was taken on a tax return that would give rise to the penalty 
assumptions 
in determining whether a tax benefit can be recorded  we must make assessments of a position s sustainability and the likelihood of ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
changes in our assessments would cause a change in our recorded position and changes could be significant 
as of december  and  we had recorded liabilities for possible losses on uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
accounting for financial guarantees when we historically entered into guarantees in connection with the sale of real estate  we were prevented from initially either accounting for the transaction as a sale of an asset or recognizing in earnings the profit from the sale transaction 
for guarantees that are not entered into in conjunction with the sale of real estate  we recognize at the inception of a guarantee or the date of modification  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee which require us to make various assumptions to determine the fair value 
on a quarterly basis  we review and evaluate the estimated liability based upon operating results and the terms of the guarantee 
if it is probable that we will be required to fund additional amounts than previously estimated  a loss is recorded 
fundings that are recoverable as a loan from a venture are considered in the determination of the loss recorded 
loan amounts are evaluated for impairment at inception and then quarterly 
assumptions and approach used 
we calculate the estimated loss based on projected cash flows during the remaining term of the guarantee 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  eg finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings is projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible loss  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
litigation litigation is subject to uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not fully predictable 
various legal actions  claims and proceedings are pending against us  some for specific matters described in note to the financial statements and others arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in other instances  we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of uncertainties related to the outcome and or the amount or range of losses 
new accounting standards we adopted the following provisions of the asc at the beginning of we adopted new provisions of asc fair value measurements topic for non financial assets and liabilities 
we had previously adopted the other provisions of fair value measurement for financial assets and liabilities beginning in the provisions are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which the provisions are applied 
adoption of these provisions of the asc did not have a material impact on our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted new provisions of the asc business combination topic beginning in these provisions require most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
transaction costs are no longer to be included in the measurement of the business acquired and instead should be expensed as incurred 
these provisions apply prospectively to business combinations occurring in or after january we adopted new provisions of the asc consolidation topic 
these provisions establish new accounting and reporting requirements for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  these provisions require the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest is now included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
the provisions also clarify that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions 
in addition  the provisions require that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
the provisions also include expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
adoption of the provisions under the consolidation topic regarding non controlling interests on january  did not have a material impact on our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted provisions of the asc derivative and hedging topic which provides guidance on certain disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees 
adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted provisions of the asc investments equity method and joint venture topic 
the intent of these provisions is to clarify the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations related to equity method investments 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the second quarter of  we adopted the following provisions of the asc  none of which had a material impact on our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows asc investments debt and equity securities topic modifies the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities through increased consistency in the timing of impairment recognition and enhanced disclosures related to the credit and non credit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold 
in addition  increased disclosures are required for both debt and equity securities regarding expected cash flows  credit losses  and an aging of securities with unrealized losses 
asc financial instruments topic requires fair value disclosures for financial instruments that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
prior to these provisions  the fair values of those assets and liabilities were disclosed only once each year 
with the adoption of these provisions  we are now required to disclose this information on a quarterly basis  providing quantitative and qualitative information about fair value estimates for all financial instruments not measured in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
asc fair value measurements topic clarifies the methodology used to determine fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
these provisions also reaffirm the objective of fair value measurement  which is to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction 
they also reaffirm the need to use judgment to determine if a formerly active market has become inactive  as well as to determine fair values when markets have become inactive 
asc subsequent events topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
in the third quarter of  we adopted the asc as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of the asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the third quarter of  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu amends the fair value measurement topic by providing additional guidance clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value including how the price of a traded debt security should be considered in estimating the fair value of the issuer s liability 
asu is effective for us for the fourth quarter of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
future adoption of accounting standards in the second quarter  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu requires an analysis to be performed to determine whether a variable interest entity gives an enterprise a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  asu requires ongoing assessments as to whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary and eliminates the quantitative approach in determining the primary beneficiary 
asu is effective for us january  we do not believe that asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
it requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
it eliminated the use of the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognized revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables subject to asu it no longer requires third party evidence 
asu is effective for us for the year beginning january  we are currently evaluating whether asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation management fees from communities operated by us for third parties and resident and ancillary fees from owned senior living communities are significant sources of our revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and community occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of senior living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the communities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of community operations 
employee compensation  including salary and benefit increases and the hiring of additional staff to support our growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable us to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of our communities 
we believe  however  that the short term nature of our resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to us of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident and ancillary fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk appears in the market risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
