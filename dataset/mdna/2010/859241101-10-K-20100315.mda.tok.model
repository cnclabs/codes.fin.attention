item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a leading heavy civil construction company that operates in one segment  heavy civil construction  through its subsidiaries  which specialize in the building  reconstruction and repair of transportation and water infrastructure primarily in large and growing markets in texas  utah and nevada 
transportation infrastructure projects include highways  roads  bridges and light and commuter rail 
water infrastructure projects include water  wastewater and storm drainage systems 
sterling provides general contracting services primarily to public sector clients  including excavating  concrete and asphalt paving  installation of large diameter water and wastewater distribution systems  construction of bridges and similar large structures  construction of light and commuter rail infrastructure  concrete and asphalt batch plant operations  concrete crushing and aggregate operations 
we perform the majority of the work required by our contracts with our own crews and equipment 
our business was founded in and has a history of profitable growth  which we have achieved by expanding both our service profile and our market areas 
this involves adding services  such as concrete operations  in order to capture a greater percentage of available work in current and potential markets 
it also involves strategically expanding operations  either by establishing an office in a new market  often after having successfully bid on and completed a project in that market  or by acquiring a company that gives us an immediate entry into a market 
on december   we acquired an interest in ralph l 
wadsworth construction company  llc rlw and on october   we acquired a interest in road and highway builders  llc rhb  which have primarily performed construction projects in utah and nevada  respectively 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in this document  and conform to the fasb s accounting standards codification or gaap or asc 
we operate in one segment and have only one reportable segment and one reporting unit component  heavy civil construction 
in making this determination  we considered that each project has similar characteristics  includes similar services and similar types of customers and is subject to similar regulatory and economic environments 
we organize  evaluate  and manage our financial information around each project when making operating decisions and assessing overall performance 
even if our local offices were to be considered separate components of our heavy civil construction operating segment  those components could be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment under asc and eitf d because our local offices all have similar economic characteristics and are similar in all of the following areas the nature of the products and services each of our local offices perform similar construction projects they build  reconstruct and repair roads  highways  bridges  light and commuter rail and water  waste water and storm drainage systems 
the nature of the production processes our heavy civil construction services rendered in the construction production process for each of our construction projects performed by each local office is the same they excavate dirt  remove existing pavement and pipe  lay aggregate or concrete pavement  pipe and rail and build bridges and similar large structures in order to complete our projects 
the type or class of customer for products and services substantially all of our customers are federal and state departments of transportation  cities  counties  and regional water  rail and toll road authorities 
a substantial portion of the funding for the state departments of transportation to finance the projects we construct is furnished by the federal government 
the methods used to distribute products or provide services the heavy civil construction services rendered on our projects are performed primarily with our own field work crews laborers  equipment operators and supervisors and equipment backhoes  loaders  dozers  graders  cranes  pug mills  crushers  and concrete and asphalt plants 
the nature of the regulatory environment we perform substantially all of our projects for federal  state and municipal governmental agencies  and all of the projects that we perform are subject to substantially similar regulation under us and state department of transportation rules  including prevailing wage and hour laws  codes established by the federal government and municipalities regarding water and waste water systems installation  and laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health of the us occupational safety and health administration and to the employment of immigrants of the us department of homeland security 
the economic characteristics of our local offices are similar 
while profit margin objectives included in contract bids have some variability from contract to contract  our profit margin objectives are not differentiated by our chief operating decision maker or our office management based on local office location 
instead  the projects undertaken by each local office are primarily competitively bid  fixed unit or negotiated lump sum price contracts  all of which are bid based on achieving gross margin objectives that reflect the relevant skills required  the contract size and duration  the availability of our personnel and equipment  the makeup and level of our existing backlog  our competitive advantages and disadvantages  prior experience  the contracting agency or customer  the source of contract funding  anticipated start and completion dates  construction risks  penalties or incentives and general economic conditions 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  different project scopes and specifications  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits for each project in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost for each project during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can adversely change the estimate of total contract revenue  cost and profit include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the failure of subcontractors to perform as agreed  unusual weather conditions  our failure to achieve expected productivity and efficient use of labor and equipment and the inaccuracies of our original bid estimate 
because we have a large number of projects in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates  particularly on larger  more complex projects  can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
revenue recognition the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
after we are advised that our bid is the winning bid  we enter into firm contracts with most of our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting those contract costs 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as a result  we have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
assuming performance by our suppliers and subcontractors  the principal remaining risks under our fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity levels 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the percentage of completion method of accounting in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to finish uncompleted contracts 
our cost estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of projects of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor and supplier performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  including goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
at december   we had goodwill with a carrying amount of approximately million which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we completed our annual impairment review for historical goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and it did not result in an impairment 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  where necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
we are subject to the alternative minimum tax  or amt  and payments of amt result in a reduction of our deferred tax liability 
our deferred tax assets related to prior year nols for financial statement purposes were fully utilized during in addition to the utilization of those nols  we had available to us the excess tax benefit resulting from exercise of a significant number of non qualified in the money options  which we utilized in the preparation of our and federal income tax returns 
accordingly  because we will no longer have offsets provided by the nols  a comparison of our future cash flows to our historic cash flows may not be meaningful 
results of operations 
backlog at december  at december   our backlog of construction projects was million  including million of our newly acquired operations in utah 
excluding our utah operations  our backlog at december   was million as compared to million at december  our texas and nevada operations were awarded or were the apparent low bidder on million of new contracts in  including million in the fourth quarter of  compared to million of new contracts in our contracts are typically completed in to months 
at december   there was approximately million of our consolidated backlog where we were the apparent low bidder  but had not yet been formally awarded the contract or the contract price had not been finalized 
historically  subsequent non awards of low bids or finalization of contract prices have not materially affected our backlog or financial condition 
consolidated and utah backlog include rlw s million share of the estimated revenues related to a joint venture in which rlw is a participant  which was selected in december by udot as the best fixed price  best design proposal for the expansion and reconstruction of the i corridor near salt lake city  utah 
during the last quarter of  throughout the year and continuing into the first quarter of  the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitive because of the following while our business includes only minimal residential and commercial infrastructure work  the severe fall off in new projects in those markets has resulted in some residential and commercial infrastructure contractors bidding on smaller public sector transportation and water infrastructure projects  sometimes at bid levels below our break even pricing  thus increasing competition and creating downward pressure on bid prices in our markets 
traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins  sometimes at bid levels below our break even pricing  in order to replenish their reduced backlogs 
these factors have limited our ability to maintain or increase our backlog through successful bids for new projects and have compressed the profitability on the new projects where we submitted successful bids 
while we have recently been more aggressive in reducing the anticipated margins we use to bid on some projects  we have not bid at anticipated loss margins in order to obtain new backlog 

table of contents recent reductions in miles driven in the us and more fuel efficient vehicles have reduced federal and state gasoline taxes and tolls collected 
in addition  the federal government has not renewed the safetea lu bill  which provided states with substantial funding for transportation infrastructure projects 
since the safetea lu bill expired on september   the federal government has been extending interim financial assistance on a month to month basis  most recently through march  at approximately of the prior year safetea lu levels 
reductions in federal funding may negatively impact the states highway and bridge construction expenditures for at the end of the third quarter of  we had anticipated these matters would be resolved in late or early in the first quarter of  however  they have not yet been resolved and we are unable to predict when or on what terms the federal government might renew the safetea lu bill or enact other similar legislation 
further  the nationwide decline in home sales  the increase in foreclosures and a prolonged recession have resulted in decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes  which are among the sources of funding for municipal road  bridge and water infrastructure construction 
these and other factors have adversely affected the levels of transportation and water infrastructure capital expenditures in our markets  reducing bidding opportunities to replace backlog and increasing competition for new projects 
assuming that these factors continue to affect infrastructure capital expenditures in our markets in the near term  and taking into account the amount of backlog we had at december  and the lower anticipated margin bid on some projects the company has recently been awarded and expects to start work on in  we currently anticipate that the company s net income and diluted earnings per common share of stock attributable to sterling common stockholders for will be substantially below the results we achieved for we do  however  expect that our markets will ultimately recover from the conditions described above and that our backlog  revenues and net income will return to levels more consistent with historical levels 
however  we cannot predict the timing of such a return to historical normalcy in our markets 
we believe that the company is in a sound financial condition and has the resources and management experience to weather current market conditions and to continue to compete successfully for projects as they become available at acceptable profit margin levels

table of contents revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  from to the decrease was due to the company winning fewer contracts as a result of an increase in the number of competitors bidding at lower prices in our texas and nevada markets for new work bid during and more days of rain in texas during the fourth quarter of than the comparable period 
further  some of our competitors in those markets appear to have been bidding at margins which were less than our break even pricing apparently in order to replenish their backlogs 
this trend has continued into the first quarter of the increase in competitors and consequent lower bid prices are due to the market conditions discussed above under backlog at december  offsetting the decrease in revenues in our texas and nevada markets were december revenues of million of our utah operations which were acquired effective december  during the last half of  we began to reduce the number of our crews as a result of completing certain projects without replacement contracts in backlog 
at december   our employees  excluding people in our utah operations  totaled versus approximately  employees at december  contracts receivables increased million at december  versus december   as a result of the acquisition of the utah operations offset by the effect of the decrease in revenues in texas 
an increase occurred in accounts payable for the same reasons  but to a lesser extent 
revenues in the fourth quarter of were million less than those in the comparable quarter of because of increased competition and adverse weather in texas  which has continued to affect our texas operations during the first quarter of revenues in texas during the fourth quarter of were the lowest revenues we have had in texas since the first quarter of the decrease in fourth quarter revenues was after including revenues for the month of december of our utah operations in consolidated revenues 
gross profit 
during and  our texas and nevada operations have had as many as contracts in progress at any one time  of various sizes  of different expected profitability and in various stages of completion 
the nearer a contract progresses toward completion  the more visibility we have in refining our estimate of total revenues including incentives  delay penalties and change orders  costs and gross profit 
thus gross profit as a percent of revenues can increase or decrease from comparable and sequential years and quarters due to variations among contracts and depending upon which contracts are just commencing or are at a more advanced stage of completion 
at december   our contracts were on average at a more advanced stage of completion than were those in progress at the comparable period end 
the increase in gross profit of million for the year over the year was due primarily to better execution on contracts in progress  differences  as discussed above  in the mix in the stage of completion and profitability of contracts in progress at december  compared to december  and one month of gross profit of million on the revenues earned by our newly acquired utah operations 
the gross margin of in the period is not expected to be indicative of the gross margin that the company will achieve in due to the market conditions discussed above under backlog at december  gross profit for the fourth quarter of of million was million less than the comparable period because of the lower quarterly revenues and adverse weather in texas offset by our utah operation s gross profit 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly financial information 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income  for increased by million over the primary reason for the increase was the g a expenses incurred by our utah operations for the month of december as a percent of revenues  g a expenses were in versus in the higher level of g a as a percent of revenues in vs 
was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in revenues in as g a and other income do not vary directly with the volume of work performed on contracts 
unusual items 
during  the company incurred million in direct cost of the acquisition of rlw which under gaap  effective january   must be charged to expense rather than capitalized as part of the acquisition cost 
also  in january   a jury awarded million to a subcontractor plaintiff against the company which has been recorded as an expense at december  the company plans to appeal the verdict see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate of in versus in is due to higher net income attributable to non controlling interest owners which are taxed to those owners rather than sterling and higher domestic production activities deduction in than net income attributable to non controlling interests 
the net income attributable to non controlling interest owners increased because of increased earnings in in nevada versus and the acquisition of our utah operations in december 
table of contents fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  change dollar amounts in thousands revenues gross profit gross margin general and administrative expenses  net other income loss operating income operating margin interest income interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income net income attributable to non controlling interest inearnings of subsidiary net income attributable to sterling stockholders contract backlog  end of year revenues 
revenues increased million  or  from to a majority of the increase was due to the revenues earned by our nevada operations  acquired on october   which were included in the consolidated results of operations for the full year of versus only two months in the remainder of the increase in revenues is the result of an increase in work performed by our texas operations as a result of better weather throughout than management estimates that revenues would have been to million greater had our houston operations not been interrupted by hurricane ike and it s after effects in september  additionally  one of our oil suppliers in nevada filed for bankruptcy in july and failed to furnish contracted oil for our production of asphalt on two of our jobs in progress  which delayed job performance and deferred approximately million of revenue into the profitability on these contracts was not materially impacted by this matter 
contract receivables are directly related to revenues and include both amounts currently due and retainage 
the increase of million in contracts receivable to million at december  versus is due to the increase in revenue for the year the days revenue in contract receivables is approximately days and days at december  and  respectively 
the days revenue in contract receivables would have been similar for the two years if the revenues of our nevada operations had been included in our revenues for a full year in revenue in the fourth quarter of increased million to million versus for the same reasons as discussed above for the full year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly financial information 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased million in over this was due to the contribution of our nevada operations in and better weather in texas during most of than during other than for the period during hurricane ike  which allowed our crews and equipment to be more productive 
while hurricane ike affected our work in  a hurricane usually does not adversely affect our profitability as much as the consistent rainy periods we had in our gross margin decreased in from because of operating inefficiencies on certain contracts in texas  higher fuel costs and lower profit margins on certain contracts started in the last half of gross profit in the fourth quarter of decreased million or from the same quarter in gross profit was of revenues in the fourth quarter versus in the fourth quarter of as a result of some unusually profitable municipal projects being performed primarily in the fourth quarter 
without those projects  the gross margins for the fourth quarter would have been more in line with normal margins  although still somewhat better than that of the fourth quarter of at december   our backlog of construction projects was million  as compared to million at december  we were awarded approximately million of new projects and change orders and recognized million of earned revenue in approximately million of the backlog at december  is expected to be completed after the decrease in backlog from was due to increased competition and economic conditions in certain of our markets 
general and administrative expenses  net  increased by million in from primarily due to a full year of g a at our nevada operations offset by lower stock compensation expense 
despite the increase in absolute g a expenses  the percentage of g a to revenue decreased to in from in as the nevada operations g a is not as large a percentage of revenues as sterling s g a which includes corporate overhead and expenses associated with being a public company 
other income decreased million and consists of gains and losses on disposal of equipment which depends on  among other things  age and condition of equipment disposed of  insurance recoveries and the market for used equipment 
operating income increased million due to the factors discussed above regarding gross profit and general and administrative expenses and other income 
net interest income was million less for than due to a decrease in interest rates on cash and short term investments combined with the imputed interest expense of million on the put option related to the minority interest in rhb 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due to the portion of earnings of a subsidiary taxed to the minority interest owner partially offset by the revised texas franchise tax which became effective july  the increase of million is due to the minority interest s share of the results of rhb included in the consolidated results of operations for a full year in versus two months in 
table of contents historical cash flows 
the following table sets forth information about our cash flows for the years ended december   and year ended december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents at end of period net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities supplementary information capital expenditures working capital at end of period operating activities 
significant non cash items included in operating activities are depreciation and amortization  which for totaled million  an increase of million from and million from as a result of million of capital expenditures in and million of capital additions in and a full year s depreciation in on equipment purchased in the rhb acquisition in october   deferred tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation methods used on equipment for tax purposes and amortization for tax return purposes of goodwill arising in the acquisition of rhb and rlw 
besides net income of million and the non cash items discussed above  other significant components of cash flows from operations  net of those acquired in the rlw business combination  are as follows contracts receivable decreased by million in the current year due to lower receivables in texas because of the decrease in revenues in  as compared to an increase of million in which was due to an increase in revenues and a higher level of customer retentions than in  the decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million as of december   versus a increase of million as of december   which was due to the decrease in project activity in and an increase in the volume of materials purchased for certain projects at december   but not billed to the customer until and timing of other billings  accounts payable decreased by million in due to lower project activity during the fourth quarter of  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by million also due to the lower project activity during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents investing activities 
expenditures for the replacement of certain equipment and to expand our construction fleet and office and shop facilities totaled million in  compared with a total of million and million in and  respectively 
capital equipment is acquired as needed to support work crews required by increased backlog and to replace retiring equipment 
the decreases in capital expenditures in and were principally due to management s cautious view regarding certain of the company s markets in and  respectively  as a result of current economic uncertainties 
management expects capital expenditures in to be higher than primarily as a result of the recent acquisition of our utah operations and construction of shop facilities in dallas and san antonio 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company had net purchases of short term securities of million and million  respectively versus a net reduction of million in primarily due to the longer term maturity greater than days at the date of purchase of the securities purchased in  and in october  we purchased a equity interest in rhb for a net cash purchase price of million and  in december  we purchased an equity interest in rlw for a net cash purchase price of million  net of cash acquired  in order to expand our construction operations to nevada and utah  respectively 
financing activities 
financing activities in primarily reflect a reduction of million in borrowings under our million credit facility as compared to a reduction of million of borrowings in the amount of borrowings under the credit facility is based on the company s expectations of working capital requirements 
additionally  the company sold common stock in and for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
liquidity 
the level of working capital for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in customer receivables and contract retentions  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings  and the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
as of december   we had working capital of million  an increase of million over december  increasing working capital is an important element in expanding our bonding capacity  which enables us to bid on larger and longer duration projects 
the increase in working capital was the result of the following in millions net income depreciation deferred tax expense proceeds of stock offering capital expenditures debt repayment cash paid for rlw  net of working capital acquired other total increase in working capital the company believes that it has sufficient liquid financial resources  including the unused portion of its credit facility  to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations  including its bonding requirements  and the company expects no material adverse change in its liquidity 
future developments or events  such as an increase in our level of purchases of equipment to support significantly higher backlog or an acquisition of another company could  however  affect our level of working capital 

table of contents sources of capital 
in addition to our available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments balances and cash provided by operations  we use borrowings under our credit facility with comerica bank to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we have a million credit facility with a bank syndicate for which comerica bank is a participant and agent 
the credit facility entered into on october  replaced a similar million revolver that had been renewed in april the credit facility has a maturity date of october   and is secured by all assets of the company  other than proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts which are pledged to our bond surety 
borrowings under the credit facility are used to finance working capital 
at december   the aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million  and the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility was million  which reduces availability under the credit facility 
availability under the credit facility was  therefore  million without violating any of the financial covenants discussed in the next paragraph 
the credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants at quarter end relating to fixed charges  leverage  tangible net worth  asset coverage and consolidated net losses 
the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make distributions and dividends  incur liens and encumbrances  incur further indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party  incur negative income for two consecutive quarters 
making investments in securities 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  the financial markets have experienced substantial volatility as a result of disruptions in the credit markets and the recession 
however  to date we have not experienced any difficulty in borrowing under our credit facility or any change in its terms 
management believes that the credit facility will provide adequate funding for the company s working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including seasonal fluctuations at least through december  the unpaid principal balance of each prime based loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to comerica s prime rate plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable prime margins will be  or  respectively 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under this revolver during the year ended december  was at all times that the company had debt outstanding under this facility 

table of contents at our election  the loans under the new credit facility bear interest at either a libor based interest rate or a prime based interest rate 
the prime based interest rate option plus the applicable prime based margin can be no less than the daily adjusting libor plus  or federal funds rate plus 
the unpaid principal balance of each libor based loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
the pricing leverage ratio is determined by the ratio of our average total debt  less cash and cash equivalents  to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda that we achieve on a rolling four quarter basis 
the pricing leverage ratio is measured quarterly 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable libor margins will be  or  respectively then the applicable prime based margins will be  and  respectively 
interest on libor based loans is payable at the end of the relevant libor interest period  which must be one  two  three or six months 
mortgage 
in we completed the construction of a new headquarters building on land owned by us adjacent to our equipment repair facility in houston 
the building was financed principally through an additional mortgage of million on the land and facilities at a floating interest rate which at december  was per annum  repayable over years 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our fixed  non cancelable obligations at december  payments due by period total year years years years amounts in thousands credit facility operating leases mortgage our obligations for interest are not included in the table above as these amounts vary according to the levels of debt outstanding at any time 
interest on our credit facility is paid monthly and fluctuates with the balances outstanding during the year  as well as with fluctuations in interest rates 
in interest on the credit facility was approximately  the mortgages are expected to have future annual interest expense payments of approximately  in less than one year   in one to three years   in four to five years and for all years thereafter 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  the non controlling interest owners of two of our subsidiaries have the right to require the company to buy their interest in those subsidiaries in and at december   the estimated put liability to those non controlling interest owners was approximately million 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts  we generally obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 

table of contents as is customary in the construction business  we are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and reputation and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
we have pledged all proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety company 
events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future  or being available only at a significantly greater cost 
to date  we have not encountered difficulties or cost increases in obtaining new surety bonds 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during were million  and during were million 
the decrease in from the level was due to management s cautious view regarding certain of the company s markets and current economic uncertainties 
in addition  we acquired of property  plant and equipment with the purchase of our utah operations 
in we expect that our capital expenditure spending will be higher than in  primarily as a result of additional equipment that may be acquired for our utah operations and construction of shop facilities in dallas and san antonio 
inflation until  inflation had not had a material impact on our financial results  however  that year s increases in oil and fuel prices affected our cost of operations 
since september   the prices we have paid for oil and fuel and  generally  for other materials have decreased 
anticipated cost increases and reductions are considered in our bids to customers on proposed new construction projects 
where we are the successful bidder on a project  we execute purchase orders with material suppliers and contracts with subcontractors covering the prices of most materials and services  other than oil and fuel products  thereby mitigating future price increases and supply disruptions 
these purchase orders and contracts do not contain quantity guarantees and we have no obligation for materials and services beyond those required to complete the contracts with our customers 
there can be no assurance that oil and fuel used in our business will be adequately covered by the estimated escalation we have included in our bids or that all of our vendors will fulfill their pricing and supply commitments under their purchase orders and contracts with the company 
we adjust our total estimated costs on our projects when we believe it is probable that we will have cost increases which will not be recovered from customers  vendors or re engineering

new accounting pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  established principles and requirements for how an acquirer of another business entity a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
also  all direct costs of the business combination must be charged to expense on the financial statements of the acquirer as incurred 
the new standard revises previous guidance as to the recording of post combination restructuring plan costs by requiring the acquirer to record such costs separately from the business combination 
we adopted this statement on january   and  in connection with the acquisition of rlw  we recorded million of direct costs as a charge to expense in the statement of operations for the year ended december  in september  the fasb established a framework for measuring fair value which requires expanded disclosure about the information used to measure fair value 
the standard applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value accounting in any new circumstances 
we adopted this standard on january   which did not have a material impact on sterling s financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a standard clarifying previous guidance on how consolidated entities should account for and report non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
the pronouncement standardizes the presentation of non controlling interests formally referred to as minority interests for both the consolidated balance sheet and income statement 
as a result of adopting this standard on january   sterling s financial statements segregate net income as attributable to the company s common stockholders and non controlling owner s interest and equity of non controlling interests in those subsidiaries 
in may  the fasb set forth general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this standard became effective in the second quarter of and did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a standard to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity 
this standard will replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
additionally  this standard will provide more timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity 
this standard will become effective in the first quarter of this standard may have the effect of requiring us to consolidate joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest 
at december   we had no participation in a joint venture where we had a material controlling interest investment 
in june  the accounting standards codification was established as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
this standard was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on sterling s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates are one of our sources of market risks 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness was at floating interest rates 
based on our average debt outstanding during  we estimate that an increase of in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  in to manage risks of changes in material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids for construction contracts  we obtain firm price quotations from our suppliers  except for fuel  and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
during  we commenced a strategy of investing in certain securities  the assets of which are a crude oil commodity pool 
we believe that the gains and losses on these securities will tend to offset increases and decreases in the price we pay for diesel and gasoline fuel and reduce the volatility of such fuel costs in our operations 
for the year ended december   the company had a realized gain of  on these securities and an unrealized gain of  we will continue to evaluate this strategy and may increase or decrease our investment in these securities depending on our forecast of the diesel and gasoline fuel markets and our operational considerations 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful
