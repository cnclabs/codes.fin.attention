item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own and or operate radio stations in markets that reach approximately of the us hispanic population 
in addition  we own and operate two television stations and have various affiliation  distribution and or programming agreements  which allow us to reach approximately million households throughout the us  including puerto rico 
the success of each of our stations depends significantly upon its audience ratings and share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
the broadcasting industry is a highly competitive business  but some barriers to entry do exist 
each of our stations competes with both spanish language and english language stations in its market  as well as with other advertising media  such as newspapers  cable television  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  satellite radio and television  transit advertising and direct mail marketing 
factors which are material to our competitive position include management experience  our stations rank in their markets  signal strength and frequency  and audience demographics  including the nature of the spanish language market targeted by a particular station 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of advertising time on our stations to local and national advertisers 
revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates that our stations are able to charge  as well as the overall demand for advertising time in each respective market 
seasonal net broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising demand from local and national advertisers 
typically for the broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue 
our most significant operating expenses are usually compensation expenses  programming expenses  professional fees  and advertising and promotional expenses 
senior management strives to control these expenses  as well as other expenses  by working closely with local station management and others  including vendors 

table of contents our radio stations are located in six of the top ten hispanic markets of los angeles  new york  puerto rico  chicago  miami and san francisco 
los angeles and new york have the largest and second largest hispanic populations  and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the united states in terms of advertising revenue  respectively 
we format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the us hispanic audience in their respective markets 
the us hispanic population is diverse  consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage 
the music  culture  customs and spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another 
we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various hispanic ethnic groups and customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve 
our radio revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local and national advertising 
our television stations and related affiliates operate under the megatv brand 
we have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment  current events and variety with high quality production 
our programming is formatted to capture shares of the us hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment company  thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional latino channels 
megatv s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs  ranging from televised radio branded shows to general entertainment programs  such as music  celebrity  debate  interviews and personality based shows 
as part of our strategy  we have incorporated certain of our on air personalities into our programming  as well as including interactive elements to complement our internet websites 
we develop and produce more than of our programming and obtain other content from spanish language production partners 
our television revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming 
as part of our operating business  we also operate lamusica 
com  mega 
tv  and our radio station websites which are bilingual spanish english websites providing content related to latin music  entertainment  news and culture 
lamusica 
com and our network of station websites generate revenue primarily from advertising and sponsorship 
in addition  the majority of our station websites simultaneously stream our stations content  which has broadened the audience reach of our radio stations 
we also occasionally produce live concerts and events throughout the united states  including puerto rico

our radio segment net revenue decreased million or  primarily due to lower local  national  and barter sales caused mainly by the decline in economic conditions 
the decrease in local  national and barter sales occurred in all of our markets 
our television segment net revenue decreased million or  primarily due to a decrease in barter and local sales and sponsorship revenue 
engineering and programming expenses the decrease in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of million or was due to the decreases in both our radio and television segment expenses 
our radio segment expenses decreased million or  primarily related to decreases in compensation and benefits for technical and programming personnel and audience research expenses due to headcount reductions 
our television segment expenses decreased million or  primarily due to decreases in original produced programming and compensation and benefits for our technical and programming personnel due to headcount reductions 
selling  general and administrative expense the decrease in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses of million or was primarily due to decreases in both our radio and television segment expenses 
our radio segment expenses decreased million or  primarily due to a decrease in advertising  promotional and marketing costs  barter expenses  sales commissions  special event expenses  compensation and benefits for our selling  general and administrative personnel due to headcount reductions and a reduction of the allowance for doubtful account provision 
our television segment expenses decreased million or  primarily due to a decrease in advertising  promotional and marketing costs  barter expenses and compensation and benefits for our selling  general and administrative personnel due to headcount reductions 

table of contents corporate expenses the decrease in corporate expenses was primarily a result of decreases in professional fees  travel and entertainment expenses and compensation and benefits for our corporate personnel due to headcount reductions 
impairment of assets and restructuring costs as a result of the impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  we recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately million that reduced the carrying values of our fcc broadcasting licenses 
the impairment loss was due to changes in estimates and assumptions which were primarily a lower industry advertising revenue growth projections in our respective markets  and b lower industry profit margins 
in addition  we entered into a sublease of office space and determined that million of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures were impaired 
as a result of the deterioration of the economy and the decrease in the demand for advertising  we began to implement a restructuring plan in to reduce expenses throughout the company 
during  we incurred expenses of million related to the termination of various programming contracts and personnel and a loss on a sublease of office space 
operating income the increase in operating income was mainly due to the decrease in the impairment of assets and restructuring costs 
also contributing to the increase in operating income was a decrease in our operating expenses  offset by a decrease in our net revenue 
interest expense  net in september and october  the counterparty to one of our interest rate swaps  lehman brothers special financing inc  and its parent and credit support provider  lehman brothers holdings inc  each filed for bankruptcy 
based on these bankruptcy filings and the information obtained prior to the filings  this cash flow hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting 
on september   the accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this hedge was million and this amount will be reclassified into earnings interest expense over the remaining life of the hedge  which terminates on june  during fiscal year  million was reclassified and recorded as interest expense primarily causing the increase in interest expense  net 
change in fair value of a derivative instrument the change in fair value of a derivative instrument is related to the aforementioned cash flow hedge that no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
the change in fair value from december  to december  impacted our earnings by million for the fiscal year income taxes the income tax expense of million arose primarily from the tax amortization of our fcc broadcasting licenses  offset by the impact of the reduction of our deferred tax liabilities related to the impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses of approximately million 

table of contents net loss the decrease in net loss was due to the decrease in operating loss related primarily to the decrease in impairment of assets and restructuring costs and the decrease in operating expenses  partially offset by the decreases in net revenue and income tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents million as of december  and cash expected to be provided by operations 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as overall advertising demand  shifts in population  station listenership and viewership  demographics  audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
our ability to raise funds by increasing our indebtedness is limited by the terms of the certificates of designation governing our series b preferred stock and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility 
additionally  our certificates of designation and credit agreement each place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  and consolidations and mergers  among other things 
our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations 
management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities  together with cash on hand  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our operating obligations in the foreseeable future  including  among other things  required quarterly interest and principal payments pursuant to the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility revolver due and senior secured credit facility term loan due  and capital expenditures  excluding the acquisitions of fcc broadcasting licenses 
while not significant to us to date  the disruptions in the capital and credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs associated with our short term and long term debt 
assumptions none of which can be assured which underlie management s beliefs  include the following the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not deteriorate further in any material respect  we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy  and we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities  including but not limited to taxes  environmental liabilities  regulatory matters and legal judgments 
as a result of the decrease in the demand for advertising and the deterioration of the economy  we began to implement a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year to reduce expenses throughout the company 
we incurred expenses related to the termination of various programming contracts and personnel and a loss on a sublease of office space 
during the fiscal year  we incurred restructuring expenses of million  of which million was paid 
as of december   the total accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet related to restructuring activities were million  of which million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million was included in other liabilities 
we evaluate strategic media acquisitions and or dispositions and strive to expand our media content through distribution and affiliations in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top us hispanic markets 
we engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and or dispositions and expansion of our content through media outlets from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions would be financed through funds generated from permitted debt financing  equity financing  operations  asset sales or a combination of these or other available sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if necessary and available  can be obtained on favorable terms for future acquisitions 

table of contents the following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the fiscal years ended december  and  with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity 
the changes set forth in the table are discussed below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
change in thousands capital expenditures radio television corporate consolidated net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents capital expenditures the decrease in our capital expenditures is a result of the completion of various capital projects in  including the build out and furnishing of the sbs miami broadcast center 
net cash flows provided by operating activities changes in our net cash flows from operating activities were primarily a result of the improved operations and a decrease in cash paid to vendors  including interest 
net cash flows used in investing activities changes in our net cash flows from investing activities were a result of the decrease in our capital expenditures due to the completion of various capital projects in  primarily the build out and furnishing of the sbs miami broadcast center 
net cash flows used in financing activities changes in our net cash flows from financing activities were primarily a result of a decrease of million of cash dividends paid on the series b preferred stock and  in fiscal year  the repayment of the non interest bearing promissory note totaling approximately million  which was offset by the proceeds of million related to the draw down of our senior credit facility revolver 
recent developments lehman interest rate swap in september and october  the counterparty to one of our interest rate swaps  lehman brothers special financing inc  and its parent and credit support provider  lehman brothers holdings inc  each filed for bankruptcy the lehman bankruptcy 
as a result of the lehman bankruptcy  a dispute has arisen with respect to payments under the swap agreement 
we have agreed to non binding mediation of our dispute with the counterparty and the mediation session is scheduled to occur at the end of march 
table of contents dividend payment on the series b preferred stock under the terms of our series b preferred stock  the holders of the outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock are entitled to receive  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  dividends on the series b preferred stock at a rate of per year  of the  liquidation preference per share  payable quarterly 
during fiscal year  our board of directors  under management s recommendation  determined that based on  among other things  the then current economic environment and future cash requirements  it would not be prudent to declare or pay the january   october  and july  cash dividends in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
our board of directors has not yet determined whether to pay the scheduled april  dividend 
in determining whether to declare and pay any future cash dividends our board of directors will consider management s recommendation  our financial condition  as well as whether  under delaware law  sufficient surplus or net profits exist to pay such dividends 
nasdaq notification letters nasdaq delisting letters and temporary extension as we initially announced on august   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq on august  indicating that we failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in nasdaq listing rule a formerly marketplace rule a for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market because the bid price of our common stock closed under per share for consecutive business days 
the notice also stated that  in accordance with nasdaq listing rule c a formerly marketplace rule e  we would be provided calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
due to nasdaq s subsequent suspensions of enforcement of the minimum bid price requirement in and  and as disclosed by our filings of various forms k  q and k  our time period for regaining compliance was extended until december  to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock had to remain at or above per share for a minimum of consecutive business days prior to the market close on december  we did not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by december  accordingly  on december   we received written notification from nasdaq the staff determination that unless we requested a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel on or before pm eastern time on december   our common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq global market at the opening of business on december  on december   we requested a hearing before the panel to appeal the staff determination in order to present our plan to address the minimum bid price deficiency the appeal 
a hearing was held on january  at the hearing  we provided nasdaq with a specific plan of how we intended to regain compliance with the minimum bid price deficiency  including a time frame for completion of such plan 
on february   we received notice from nasdaq indicating that nasdaq had granted our request for an extension of time to regain compliance with the rule the nasdaq extension notice 
pursuant to the terms of the nasdaq extension notice  we will be required to  on or before june   evidence a closing bid price of or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
in the event that we do not evidence compliance with the rule and all other requirements for continued listing  our securities may be delisted from the nasdaq global market 

table of contents nasdaq audit committee compliance letter on august   we notified nasdaq that due to the vacancy in our audit committee created by antonio fernandez voluntary resignation as a member of the board  we were no longer in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule rule  which requires that the audit committee be comprised of at least three members  each of whom are independent 
as a result  on august   we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the audit committee requirements as set forth in rule and advising us that  consistent with nasdaq marketplace rule c a  nasdaq will provide us the following cure period to regain compliance until the earlier of our next annual shareholders meeting or august   or if the next annual shareholders meeting is held before february   no later than february  since we intend to hold our next annual shareholders meeting after february  and before august   we will have until our next annual shareholders meeting to regain compliance 
an active search for mr 
fernandez replacement is currently underway and we fully intend to regain compliance with rule within the cure period allowed by nasdaq 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc broadcasting licenses 
fcc broadcasting licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the telecommunications act of the act 
the act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if i it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act of or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations  which taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so 
historically  there has been no material challenge to our license renewals 
in addition  the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we do not amortize our fcc broadcasting licenses 
we test these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs that may indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we test our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market cluster level 
we apply the guidance of fasb asc topic  unit of accounting for purposes of testing for impairment of intangible assets not subject to amortization asc  to certain of our fcc broadcasting licenses  if their market operations are consolidated 

table of contents our valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which assumes the fcc broadcasting licenses are acquired and operated by a third party 
the valuation method used is based on the premise that the only asset that the unbuilt start up station would possess is the fcc broadcasting license 
the valuation method isolates the income attributable to a fcc broadcasting license by modeling a hypothetical greenfield build up to a normalized enterprise that  by design  lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for as part of the build up process 
consequently  the resulting accretion in value is solely attributed to the fcc broadcasting license 
in the discounted cash flow projections  a period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analysis 
the yearly streams of cash flows are adjusted to present value using an after tax discount rate calculated for the broadcast industry as of december of each year 
a risk premium is added to this base rate  in order to reflect the uncertainty associated with a start up operation 
additionally  it is necessary to project the terminal value at the end of the ten year projection period 
the terminal value represents the hypothetical value of the licenses at the end of a ten year period 
an estimated amount of taxes are deducted from the assumed terminal value  which accordingly is discounted to net present value 
the key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow model are market advertising revenue projections  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates 
these assumptions vary based on the market size  type of broadcast of signal  media competition and audience share 
these assumptions primarily reflect industry norms for similar stations broadcast signals  as well as historical performance and trends of the markets 
in the preparation of the fcc broadcasting license appraisals  estimates and assumptions are made that affect the valuation of the intangible asset 
these estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future 
the key assumptions for the respective markets are further described as follows market advertising revenue projections 
revenues are based on estimates of market revenues gathered from various third party sources 
fiscal year total market revenues were determined based on this data and market revenues were forecast over the year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rates for the broadcast industry and each market 
over the year projection period  revenue growth rates have been projected to return to growth rates equal to the expected long term growth rate in each market 
the long term growth rates have been estimated based on historical and expected performance in each market 
in determining revenue growth rates in each market  revenue growth forecasts from various industry analysts are reviewed and analyzed 
market revenue share projections 
market revenue share projections are based upon the most recent average adjusted audience share for comparable stations operating in each market 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to the average competitor  assuming that competitor had similar technical facilities 
anticipated operating profit margins 
operating profits are defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax  and corporate allocation charges 
operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margin 
operating profit margins for each station are projected based upon industry operating margin norms  which reflect market size and station type 
in determining operating profit margins in each market  third party information is utilized 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 

table of contents risk adjusted discount rates 
discount rates of for radio licenses and for television licenses were used to calculate the present value of the net after tax cash flows 
the discount rates are based on an after tax rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital model as of december  the discount rates are not specific to us or to the stations  but are based upon the expected rates that would be used by a typical market participant  which include a risk premium 
these key assumptions are subject to such factors as overall advertising demand  station listenership and viewership  audience tastes  technology  fluctuation in preferred advertising media and the estimated cost of capital 
since a number of factors may influence the determination of the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses  we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future 
any significant change in these factors will result in a modification of the key assumptions  which may result in an additional impairment 
for example  changes in the discount rates will significantly impact our impairment testing 
we note that a basis point increase in the discount rates would result in an additional impairment of million 
as of december   the percentage by which the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses exceeded or equaled their carrying values were as follows market market market market market market market goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
asc requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units under asc  radio and television 
we currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit 
we have aggregated our operating components radio stations into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics  including consideration of the requirements in fasb asc  segment reporting  as required by asc our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment  business model  gross margins  nature of services and the process for delivering these services 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we performed interim and annual impairment reviews of our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
the estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing 
in addition  there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit  therefore we have not performed a step two impairment test 
when evaluating our estimated enterprise value  we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our fcc broadcasting licenses ie our stations and use of a risk adjusted discount rate 
we did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization  including but not limited to our recent nasdaq delisting notices  limited trading volume  the impact of our television segment operating losses  and the significant voting control of our chairman and ceo 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
fasb asc  income taxes asc  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of adopting fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes 
as a result  we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  on the date of adoption  we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions which require that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
interest and penalties on tax liabilities  if any  would be recorded in interest expense and other non interest expense  respectively 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers  age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  a fixed and determinable price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
agency commissions  where applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue 
advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings  less their commission  to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances 
contingencies and litigations we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued asu  transfers and servicing topic 
asu removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe and eliminates the exception from applying fasb asc  consolidation of variable interest entities  to qualifying special purpose entities 
furthermore  asu establishes specific conditions to account for a transfer of financial assets as a sale  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosure 
asu is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november   which for us is our fiscal year beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu is a revision to pre existing guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie  a qualitatively on going re assessment on whether the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie and additional disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
in addition  this statement revises the methods utilized for determining whether an entity is a vie and the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
asu is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november   which for us is our fiscal year beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu on our results of operations and financial position 
impact on inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition
