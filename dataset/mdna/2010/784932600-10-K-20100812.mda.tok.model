table of contents harness ideas and expertise from the extended value chain institutionalize organizational wisdom and make it discoverable by anyone  anytime  anywhere on multiple devices background we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in australia  canada  france  germany  india  japan and the united kingdom through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
sources of revenue we generate revenues from the sale of subscription services  software licenses and professional services 
subscription services subscription revenue includes revenue from delivery of our products in the cloud and revenue from license updates and product support 
customers that desire to access our products in the cloud generally sign subscription agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
license updates and product support include the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our subscription revenue depends upon both our sales of additional subscription services and renewals of existing agreements 
we believe that subscription revenue will grow steadily for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and we will continue to add new subscription customers 
software licenses we license our software solutions in multiple element arrangements that include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
our license revenue is affected by  among other things  the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to twelve months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting and education services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that have purchased our products directly from us 
these consulting and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after the product purchase 
accordingly  our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software 
table of contents updates as our license customers may engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and on a fixed fee basis 
generally  consulting services related to software implementation are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees  and the fees of third party subcontractors  who provide professional services 
cost of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges related to the infrastructure required to deliver our products in the cloud  third party license royalty costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses 
the amortization of acquired developed technology  which comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in an acquisition in  is also included in the cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses 
because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses  an increase in services  including subscription services  as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in the case of selling both professional and cloud based services  our professional services revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining subscription period concurrently with the associated subscription revenue  we also defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable service period 
we classify deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
as of may   the deferred balance of the professional services revenue related to such subscription offerings and the related deferred costs was million and million  respectively 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription period  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to subscription revenue based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring  to the research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries including stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate communication  rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts  and administrative and professional services fees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap as set forth in the financial accounting standards board s accounting standard codification the codification and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the sec 
gaap  as set forth within the codification  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
table of contents statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affect our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenue in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition formerly american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under asc  saba recognizes license revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we recognize revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to certain subscription offerings and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately  or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
subscription revenues include revenue from the delivery of our products in the cloud and revenue from license updates and product support 
revenue from providing customers with access to our products in the cloud is recognized as a service arrangement ratably over the term of the arrangement upon delivery or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
certain of our cloud based offerings are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software  in which case revenue is recognized under asc formerly sab no  revenue recognition 
our cloud based offerings also include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
license updates and product support revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically months 
license revenue from licenses with a term of three years or more is generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of asc are satisfied 
license revenue from licenses with a term of less than three years is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
in arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  we allocate the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual license of similar 
table of contents products 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of asc are satisfied 
professional service revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although  we generally provide professional services on a time and materials basis  a portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for services performed on a fixed fee basis  revenue is generally recognized on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method or  if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services  we use the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with asc and relevant guidance of asc construction type and certain production type contracts formerly sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred and the item has been accepted by the customer 
if the requirements of asc are not met when we bill a customer or a customer pays us  the billed or paid amount is recorded as deferred revenue  a liability account 
as the revenue recognition criteria of asc are satisfied  the requisite amounts are recognized as revenue 
in arrangements that include professional services and delivery of our products in the cloud  but not a license of our software  we recognize revenue for professional services as the services are performed if these professional services qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
if the professional services do not qualify as a separate element of the arrangement  the professional services revenue is recognized ratably over the longest subscription service period 
additionally  we defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable subscription period 
we classify deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to subscription revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the professional services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled million as of may   is based on our assessment of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
past due balances based on order terms and other specific accounts as necessary are reviewed monthly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we account for goodwill under asc goodwill formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill balance at may  was million  including million and million recorded as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  respectively 
we account for purchased intangible assets under asc formerly sfas no 

amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was million for fiscal  and as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million  net of accumulated amortization 
the total expected future amortization related to purchased intangible assets will be approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents asc prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase requires us to test for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  requires us to measure and allocate for the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment arise or circumstances otherwise dictate 
a significant and extended reduction in our enterprise fair value to below the recorded amount of our stockholders equity could indicate a change in our business climate and under asc  we could be required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and record an expense for an impairment loss 
in accordance with asc and asc property  plant and equipment  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived asset groups  including property and equipment and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we did not identify any such indicators in each of the fiscal years ended may   and restructuring costs 
during fiscal year  management approved and initiated a plan to decrease costs during the third and fourth quarters by eliminating positions  representing approximately of the workforce across all functions the plan 
the total accrued restructuring balance of  was paid off by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year ended may   which across all functions consisted primarily of severance and fringe benefits 
share based compensation 
under asc compensation stock compensation formerly known as sfas r  share based payment  we are required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although  we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
under asc  the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
also in connection with our adoption of asc  we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes merton bsm pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
asc requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock based award activity under asc to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities 
excess benefits of tax deductions were  and have been recorded through may  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting period 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  segregating foreign and domestic earnings and expenses 
table of contents to avoid double taxation  and determining required intercompany revenue sharing  cost reimbursement and other transfer pricing arrangements among related entities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and stock based compensation deductions 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we maintain a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
a portion of the valuation allowance pertains to deferred tax assets established in connection with prior acquisitions  and to the extent that this portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal  goodwill was adjusted 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
in the event that we were to determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be credited to earnings in the period in which we made such determination 
if we later determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charges to earnings at such time 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
under asc income taxes formerly known as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  we are required to take a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit assuming that all issues are audited and resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes are considered 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  expiration of statutes of limitation on potential assessments or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties

professional services revenue 
professional services revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the recessionary environment experienced in the prior fiscal year and an increase in sales of professional services for saba products through indirect channels negatively impacting our professional services revenue as services related to these sales are increasingly provided by our channel partners 
professional services revenue decreased  or less than  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was slight  despite the negative impact of the recessionary environment  since it was offset by higher demand for our consulting services for upgrades and expansions from our existing customer base

deferred revenues deferred revenues consisted of the following may  in thousands subscription professional services licenses total deferred revenues deferred revenues  current deferred revenues  non current total deferred revenues deferred subscription revenue includes deferred software license updates and product support revenue as well as deferred revenue from products made available in the cloud 
deferred subscription revenue represents contracts for which cash has been received plus billings for which the service has started but cash has not been received 
subscription contracts are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance and revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
deferred professional services revenues include amounts invoiced for consulting and educational services  which have not yet been delivered 
in addition  deferred professional services revenue includes amounts invoiced for services that have been delivered  but are not separable from cloud based subscriptions 
revenues for services that are not separable from cloud based subscriptions are deferred until performance has been completed and then recognized ratably over the longest period of the arrangement 
deferred revenues from new software licenses typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements  term license agreements that are recognized over the related term  customer specific acceptance provisions  and software license transactions that cannot be segmented from consulting services or certain extended payment term arrangements 
our deferred revenue is generally at its lowest annual levels at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters 
we have disproportionately higher levels of subscription renewal billing  during our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
commissions commissions are generally expensed as they are earned per the terms of the sales compensation plans

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth condensed consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year or any other period

if revenues fall below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 

table of contents factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described under the caption item a risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources years ended may  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents we have funded our operations through operating activities and our most significant source of operating cash flows stems from customer purchases of our subscription services  professional services and licenses 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel and facilities related expenditures 
as of may   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the million decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash collections resulting from a million lower opening accounts receivable balance for fiscal year  partially offset by million in higher collections of fiscal year billings 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the million increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash collections resulting from a million higher opening accounts receivable balance for fiscal year  a million increase resulting from a higher utilization of non cash adjustment to goodwill and a reduction in net loss  partially offset by million in lower collections of fiscal year billings and a favorable cash impact of million due to higher cash flow benefit from deferred revenue for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the fiscal year ended may  total accounts receivable billing days outstanding bdo was days at may  and days at may  the increase in bdo was due to lower collections in the quarter ended may  compared to the same period in the prior year 
bdo is calculated using the current quarter total billings and calculating average daily billings per day 
the accounts receivable aging balance at the end of the period is then divided by the average billing amount to determine the bdo at the end of the period 
total accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  based on a quarter calculation  was days at may  and days at may  changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso and bdo include timing of license revenue and the proportion of that license revenue relative to our other types of revenue  timing of billing of our professional services revenue  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal was to purchase additional equipment for use in our operations 
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal to million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease included a stock buyback of million  
table of contents repurchase of stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations on restricted stock units of million and notes payable of million  partially offset by an increase of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal to million compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash used included a reduction from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of cash used for the repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities and equipment term loans offset by a reduction in cash proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock based compensation plans from million in fiscal to million in fiscal contractual obligations and commitments on july   we established a credit facility to provide for a revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july  an aggregate principal amount of up to million was available under the revolving line of credit 
with respect to borrowings in excess of million  the revolving line of credit was a receivables borrowing base credit facility 
the revolving line of credit also included a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit  cash management and foreign exchange services 
the interest rate applicable to the revolving line of credit was  at our option  equal to either i the sum of the prime rate as defined in the facility plus  or ii the sum of the libor rate as defined in the facility plus 
no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of may  the revolving line of credit matured on july  and no amounts were outstanding as of such date 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  combined with cash flows generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements  for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or seek  to raise additional funds in the future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  any raising of additional funds could dilute our current stockholders ownership interests 
during the fiscal quarter ended february   we entered into a non cancelable three year contract for software services of which million remained payable as of may  as of may   except for this three year contract for software services  we did not have any additional significant purchase obligations for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at may  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates has historically related primarily to our borrowings and investments 
we do not believe that we currently have any material exposure to interest rate risk 
our revolving line of credit matured on july  and no amounts were outstanding as of such date 
accordingly  we currently neither have any outstanding borrowings nor any credit facility from which we can borrow 
we do not believe that we currently have any material exposure to interest rate risk resulting from our investments 
at may   we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was invested in money market accounts bearing variable interest rates of between and 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents is held in non interest bearing accounts at several banks 
variable interest rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
foreign currency risk we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  japanese yen or other foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from our inter company accounts which are typically denominated in the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries  which is the local currency 
when these inter company accounts are translated into us dollars  they have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during the fiscal year ended may   our total realized and unrealized losses due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily british pound  european union euro  japanese yen and australian dollar  were  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in fiscal year  we had a foreign currency rate variance of less than 
as of may   we did not enter into any foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future
