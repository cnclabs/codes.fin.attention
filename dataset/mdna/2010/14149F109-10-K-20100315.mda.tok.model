in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
in addition  this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our risk factors in item a above 
overview we are a financial holding company formed in and headquartered in fairfax county  virginia 
we were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several virginia based banks 
these bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank with banking offices located in northern virginia and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
additionally  we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries  including mortgage banking through george mason mortgage  llc george mason and cardinal first mortgage  llc cardinal first  collectively the mortgage banking segment  retail securities brokerage though cardinal wealth services  inc cws  asset management through wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  and trust  estate  custody  investment management and retirement planning through the trust division of cardinal bank 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through five branches 
table of contents located throughout the metropolitan washington  dc region 
george mason does business in eight states  primarily virginia and maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion and billion of loans in and  respectively  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason the managed companies 
george mason s primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees  net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
at the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower  we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party 
our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released 
george mason also offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for george mason and are classified as loans held for sale 
george mason s business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  george mason has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
cardinal first originates mortgage loans for new homes and refinancing in virginia  maryland  and washington  dc principally for existing cardinal bank customers 
wilson bennett provides asset management services to certain of our customers 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett s primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will be  assuming a consistent customer base  more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
in july  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at par beginning september the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry  and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an important source of revenue for us and 
table of contents includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income  which includes trust revenues  gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of mortgage loans and management fee income 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income is a lower percentage of our total revenue in than and because mortgage originations were lower due to the cyclical nature of the mortgage banking business 
economic environment was a transition year as the us economy began to stabilize although unemployment continued to rise 
consumer spending  which had declined sharply in the second half of  rose modestly in each quarter of and received a boost from government sponsored programs such as cash for clunkers during the third quarter of despite this modest rise  consumer spending remained tentative as households saved more and paid down debt 
after reaching lows in january  housing activity increased compared to as home sale and new housing starts rose through the year lifting residential construction 
however  large inventories of unsold homes and the increase in foreclosures continued to weigh heavily on the housing sector 
businesses cut production  inventories  employment and capital spending aggressively in response to the financial crisis in late continuing into despite the modest growth in product demand and output in the second half of the year  job layoffs mounted  and the unemployment rate increased to over in the fourth quarter  its highest level since the early s 
the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate to close to zero percent early in the first quarter of and in mid march announced a program whereby the federal reserve purchased u 
s 
treasury securities  mortgage backed securities  and the long term debt of government sponsored agencies 
this program contributed to lower mortgage rates generating an increase in consumer mortgage refinancing which helped homeowners  and along with lower home prices  stimulated activity in the housing market 
in early  the short term funding markets began to return to normal and the us government began to wind down its alternative liquidity funding facilities and loan and asset guarantee programs 
by mid year  order had been restored to most financial market sectors 
the stock market rally through year end partially restored household net worth and increased consumer confidence 
despite the aforementioned economic conditions  our credit quality remained strong 
at december   we have non accrual loans totaling  a decrease of million compared to million at december  in addition  loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest decreased  from  at december  to  at december  net charge offs were of our average loans receivable for the year ended december  as compared to at december  our mortgage banking segment has profited from the recent actions taken by the federal reserve to reduce interest rates  which spurred an increase in mortgage activity as homeowners sought to refinance their current mortgages and other consumers have seen an opportunity to purchase housing as it has become more affordable 
in addition  the extension of the first time home buyers credit to april  has increased the number of homes sold 
net income from our mortgage banking segment was million for the year ended 
table of contents december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  a majority of the change in net income from our mortgage banking segment was a result of the goodwill impairment charge and repurchases and settlements of previously sold mortgage loans 
also  during the year ended december   we successfully raised million in common equity capital to further capitalize the company  to further penetrate our existing footprint and take advantage of bank consolidation opportunities 
the market disturbances that have been experienced in the financial markets over the past two years continue to impact our results 
market illiquidity continues to impact certain portions of our investment securities portfolio  specifically the ratings of certain monoline insurance providers  which has affected the pricing of certain municipal securities in our portfolio 
in addition  we hold investments of million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities  which are significantly below book value as of december  due to the lack of liquidity in the market and investor apprehension for investing in these types of securities 
we expect very challenging economic and operating conditions to continue for the foreseeable future and these conditions will continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results in the degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions 
while our loan growth was strong during  continued negative economic conditions could adversely affect our loan portfolio  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which we expect could impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
continued deterioration in real estate values and household incomes could result in higher credit losses for us 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially 
the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries may not function as we have anticipated 
liquidity is essential to our business 
the primary sources of funding for our bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash  including deposits 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as general market disruption  negative views about the financial services industry generally  or an operational problem that affects a third party or us 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events 
while we believe we have a healthy liquidity position  any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future 
in addition to the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the us government has continued to respond to the ongoing financial crisis and economic slowdown by enacting new legislation and expanding or establishing a number of programs and initiatives 
the american recovery and reinvestment act arra is intended to expand and establish government spending programs and provide tax cuts to stimulate the economy 
congress and the us government continue to evaluate and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the financial and housing markets and stimulate the economy  including the us treasury s announced financial stability plan and the us government s announced foreclosure prevention program 
there can be no assurance as to the impact these programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of these efforts to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current or financial market conditions could 
table of contents materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit  our regulatory capital position or the trading price of our common stock 
financial developments the year ended december  was a record year of profitability for us 
for the year  we reported net income of million on a consolidated basis 
the bank recorded net income of million and our mortgage banking operations recorded net income of million 
the wealth management and trust services business segment reported net income of  for the year ended december  a loss of million was recorded in the parent company for the year ended december   as the parent company serves as a source of strength to its subsidiaries and represents an overhead function rather than an operating segment 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of  which was impacted by several cash and noncash charges 
the bank recorded net income of million which was offset by net losses recorded by george mason of million during george mason s results for were impacted by an impairment charge to its goodwill of million and a cash settlement of million to one of its mortgage correspondents related to the loan purchase agreement between the two parties 
in addition  the bank recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our investment in fannie mae perpetual preferred stock 
see financial overview below for additional information on these charges 
the wealth management and trust services segment  which includes cws  wilson bennett and our trust division  recorded net income of  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from initial estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities  accounting for economic hedging activities  accounting for impairment testing of goodwill  accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets  the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 

table of contents for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we typically apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
in certain instances  we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis 
for these loans  we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and consider estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis 
if the net collateral value is less than the loan balance including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
fair value measurements we determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy  which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
our investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry wide valuation service 
this service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade  bid  and other market information 
generally  the methodology includes broker quotes  proprietary models  vast descriptive terms and conditions databases  as well as extensive quality control programs 
for certain of our held to maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity  we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources 
our interest rate swap derivatives are recorded at fair value using observable inputs from a national valuation service 
these rates are applied to a third party industry wide valuation model 
we also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forwards loan sales commitments 
the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments consider the expected premium discount to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan 
in addition  we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination  and then period end  using applicable published mortgage backed investment security prices 
the fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date 
at loan closing  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale  which are carried at the lower of cost or market value 

table of contents accounting for economic hedging activities we record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
for derivatives designated as hedges  we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis 
ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective 
in situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges 
the fair values of loan commitments and the fair values of forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions  and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
the forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 
accounting for impairment testing of goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is tested on at least an annual basis for impairment 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
this discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including estimated future cash flows from operations  an estimate of a terminal value  a discount rate  and other inputs 
our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets  including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in tabular format  information about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements  counterparty credit risk  and the company s strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments 
this guidance is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after november  the adoption provided for enhanced disclosure but otherwise did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in april  we adopted new accounting guidance for recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this standard modified the indicator of other than temporary impairment for debt securities 
in addition  it amended the amount of an other than temporary impairment that is recognized in earnings when there are credit losses on a debt security for which management does not intend to sell and for which it is more likely than not that the entity will not have to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
in those situations  the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings  and the remaining difference between the debt security s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in april  we adopted new accounting guidance for determining when a market for an asset or a liability is active or inactive and determining when a transaction is distressed 
this standard reaffirmed the exit price objective of fair value measurements and provides guidance on inactive markets and distressed transactions 
this standard is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in april  we adopted new accounting guidance for interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this guidance requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
this standard is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  the adoption provided for enhanced disclosure but otherwise did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
on july   we adopted new accounting guidance for the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  the codification 
the codification is the exclusive authoritative reference for nongovernmental us gaap for use in financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   except for sec rules and interpretive releases  which are also authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards

book value per share at december  and was and  respectively 
total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was at december  compared to at december  accordingly  we were considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes at december  we recorded net income of  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted common share  in our operating results for the year ended december  and were adversely impacted by several events 
these events are discussed in detail below during the third quarter of  we performed our annual evaluation of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of george mason 
goodwill of million was recognized as a result of this acquisition 
we employed the services of a valuation consultant to assist us with the goodwill evaluation 
the analysis included certain valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow approach 
following the acquisition  george mason delivered excellent financial results and returns on our investment 
recent and ongoing challenges in the regional residential real estate market have negatively impacted the cash flows expected to be generated by george mason in the near term 
the valuation analysis indicated that the goodwill was impaired and we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million in the mortgage banking segment 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our investment in fannie mae perpetual preferred stock 
this impairment charge was recorded in the commercial banking segment 
during the second quarter of  george mason recorded a cash settlement to one of its mortgage correspondents related to the loan purchase agreement between the two parties 
this settlement agreement provided for the release of known and unknown claims by the mortgage correspondent in exchange for a million payment to the correspondent 
george mason also entered into similar agreements with certain third party mortgage companies from which george 
table of contents mason purchased mortgage loans and subsequently sold to this mortgage correspondent 
these settlement agreements provided for a total payment of million to george mason by those third party mortgage companies 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million loss on an escrow arrangement with liberty growth fund  lp and aims worldwide  inc we served as the escrow agent in connection with an equity financing transaction between liberty growth fund and aims worldwide 
in that transaction  liberty growth fund had agreed to purchase from aims worldwide shares of its preferred stock for million 
aims worldwide would then use these proceeds to fund its acquisition of two other companies 
as provided in the escrow agreement  liberty growth fund delivered a check to us in the amount of million on july  on july   we released funds totaling million to aims worldwide and certain of its designated beneficiaries and shares of aims worldwide s preferred stock and warrants to an agent of liberty growth fund 
we then learned that liberty growth fund had previously stopped payment on its check 
liberty growth fund issued another check in the same amount  but that check was dishonored for lack of sufficient funds 
of the total amount charged off  we recovered  from one of the parties involved in the transaction 
also contributing to our decrease in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was an increase in our provision for loan losses of million to million for the year ended december  due to the loan growth we had during the year  increase in net loan charge offs  and changes to certain qualitative factors in our allowance for loan losses estimates  as compared to million for the same period of non interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of due primarily to decreases in gains on sales of loans and investment fee income

average interest bearing deposits decreased million to million in from billion in the largest decrease in average interest bearing deposit balances was in certificates of deposit  which decreased million compared to interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
we employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity 
we use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
with the funding markets still lacking liquidity  forecasts for deposit rate movements carry greater uncertainty than when this market is functioning normally 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest 
table of contents rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were asset sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
asset sensitive means that yields on the bank s interest earnings assets will rise faster than interest bearing liability costs in a rising rate environment 
for a declining rate environment  asset yields will fall faster than interest bearing liability costs 
being asset sensitive our net interest income should increase in a rising rate scenario 
in the up basis point scenario  our net interest income would improve by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the down basis point scenario the interest rate risk model indicates that our net interest income would decrease by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the increase in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a direct result of increases in non performing loans and the adverse migration of certain loans through our allowance for loan losses calculation model because of current and ongoing adverse economic conditions 
while we continue to report strong credit quality in our loan portfolio  we have experienced increases in our watch list credit and net charge offs 
our provision was impacted by net new loan growth in addition to our evaluation of the credit quality in our loan portfolio and the qualitative factors we use to determine the adequacy of our loan loss reserves 
we recorded net loan charge offs of million for each of the years ended december  and we charged off  in commercial and industrial loans  residential loans of million and consumer loans of  annualized net charged off loans was of average loans receivable for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  non accrual loans totaled  at december  compared to million at december  while our loan growth was strong during  continued negative economic conditions could adversely affect our home equity line of credit  credit card and other loan portfolios  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which we expect could impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
continued deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values  employment data and household incomes could result in higher credit losses for us 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
at december   our commercial real estate portfolio was of our total loan portfolio 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially  and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries  may not function as we have anticipated

these investments are designated as trading securities  and as such  the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings 
these trading losses were primarily the result of lower stock prices and were partially offset by a reduction in our compensation expense associated with this benefit plan 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of decreased realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities by george mason of million

investment securities our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity 
the investment portfolio consists of investment securities available for sale  investment securities held to maturity and trading securities 
investment securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
these securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset liability strategy  liquidity management or regulatory capital management 
investment securities held to maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability 
these securities include cash equivalents  equities and mutual funds 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our trading securities 
investment securities were million at december   an increase of million or  from million in investment securities at december  of the million in the investment portfolio at december   million were classified as held to maturity  and million were classified as available for sale 
at december   the yield on the available for sale investment portfolio was and the yield on the held to maturity portfolio was we complete reviews for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
as of december   the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated aaa by a leading rating agency 
investment securities which carry a aaa rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
at december   of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio are guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the government national mortgage association gnma 

table of contents we have million in non government non agency mortgage backed securities 
these securities are rated from aaa to aa 
the various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes  which could impact the ratings of these securities 
at december  and  certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position 
investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment 
contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage backed securities are guaranteed and or funded by the us government 
other mortgage backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due 
we do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities 
in addition  our held to maturity portfolio includes investments in four pooled trust preferred securities  totaling million at december  each security has a par value of million 
the collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions or insurers 
we own the a tranches in each issuance 
each of the bonds are rated by more than one rating agency 
two of the securities have composite ratings of aa and two the securities have a composite rating of bbb 
these ratings are consistent with the grades from the other rating agencies 
there is minimal observable trading activity for these types of securities 
we have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services 
given the level of subordination below our a tranches  and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral  we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the four securities  and concluded that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
no other than temporary impairment was recorded on the securities in our investment portfolio as of december  during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of million related to an investment in fannie mae perpetual preferred stock 
the full amount of this impairment was deemed to be related to credit deterioration of the issuer  and not related to equity market conditions 
because of the minimal likelihood that these shares would recover  we made a decision to exit this type of investment security and no longer own any similar equity investment in our investment securities portfolio 
during  we sold all shares of our fannie mae perpetual preferred stock for a loss of  we elected to sell our shares as a result of these shares being traded well below their par value following the placement of fannie mae into conservatorship by federal regulators in we hold million in fhlb stock at december  during  the fhlb of atlanta announced a change in their dividend declaration and payment schedule beginning during the fourth quarter of the change was initiated so that the dividend can be declared and paid to member banks after the fhlb has calculated their net income for the preceding quarter 
during  the fhlb announced changes to its capital stock requirements 
specifically  the fhlb board of directors increased the dollar cap on its stock purchases from million to million and repurchases of member excess stock will be evaluated on a quarterly basis instead of a daily basis 
we do not expect the above changes to materially impact our liquidity position

capital resources capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance 
our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution 
the guidelines define capital as both tier which includes common shareholders equity  defined to include certain debt obligations and tier to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and of unrealized gains in equity securities 
shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  the increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to our completion of a common stock offering during may  for which we added million in capital

table of contents liquidity liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers 
we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items into cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
during  we joined the certificates of deposit account registry services cdars 
cdars allows our customers to access fdic insurance protection on multi million dollar certificates of deposit through our bank 
when a customer places a large deposit through cdars  we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the cdars network in increments of less than  so that principal and interest are eligible for fdic insurance protection 
we also maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale  totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank s secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its residential real estate loan portfolio to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial real estate and commercial industrial loan portfolios pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  these facilities are subject to the fhlb and the federal reserve approving disbursement to us 
in addition  we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of million available to us 
we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 

table of contents contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows table contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligations 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to three interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations 
george mason estimates a reserve early pay off reserve for mortgage loans sold that are repaid by the borrower within a certain number of days following the loan sale  thereby requiring that george mason refund part of the service release premium and or premium pricing received from the investor pursuant to the loan sale agreement 
the reserve as of december  and was  and  respectively 

table of contents george mason has a reserve for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor 
during and  george mason either repurchased from or settled with investors on such loans for a total of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the reserve for unresolved claims was million and million  respectively 
we evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims 
we have taken actions with respect to our investor arrangements in an attempt to limit the number of future claims 
in addition  george mason  as part of the service it provides to its managed companies  purchases the loans originated by managed companies at the time of origination 
these loans are then sold by george mason to investors 
george mason has agreements with its managed companies requiring that the managed company fund the repurchase or settle the claim  for any loans that were originated by the managed company and for which investors have requested george mason to repurchase due to the borrowers failure to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor 
in the event that the managed company s financial condition deteriorates and it is unable to fund the repurchase of such loans  george mason may have to provide the funds to repurchase these loans from investors 
in this instance  george mason would establish an allowance on the receivable from the managed company 
there is no such allowance recorded at december  or as management fully recovered all amounts owed by managed companies as of these same period end dates 
during the second quarter of  george mason entered into an agreement with a mortgage correspondent related to the loan purchase agreement between the two parties 
the agreement provided for the release of known and unknown claims by the mortgage correspondent in exchange for a million payment to the correspondent 
the terms of this agreement require that we may be obligated to make additional payments to the correspondent in future periods based on certain conditions 
we believe the additional exposure under this agreement is not material over the course of the next two years 
the amount of the exposure declines with the passage of time 
in conjunction with this agreement  george mason also entered into similar agreements with certain managed companies  from which george mason purchased mortgage loans and subsequently sold to this mortgage correspondent 
these settlement agreements provided for a total payment of million to george mason by those managed companies 
the net amount of this settlement is reported in the non interest expense section of the statement of operations 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit of million as of december  were related to george mason s pipeline and were of a short term nature 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments 
table of contents are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm 
the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
with the funding markets still lacking liquidity  forecasts for deposit rate movements carry greater uncertainty than when this market is functioning normally 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were asset sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
asset sensitive means that yields on the bank s interest earnings assets will rise faster than interest bearing liability costs in a rising rate environment 
for a declining rate environment  asset yields will fall faster than interest bearing liability costs 
being asset sensitive our net interest income should increase in a rising rate scenario 
in the up basis point scenario  our net interest income would improve by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the down basis point scenario the interest rate risk model indicates that our net interest income will decrease by not more than over the one year period and the and by not more than two year time horizon 
see also interest rate sensitivity in item above for a discussion of our interest rate risk 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to certain interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations
