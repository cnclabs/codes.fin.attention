item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 
overview while ns results in reflect the decline of the domestic and global economies  they also demonstrate ns ability to focus on safety  service  asset management  and sustainability all while controlling costs 
revenues decreased billion  or  in  as manufacturers reduced production to meet sagging consumer demand and the decline in oil prices resulted in lower fuel surcharge revenues 
carloadings were down million units  or  reflecting declines across all commodity groups 
ns partially offset this decline in revenues with a billion  or  decrease in operating expenses 
notwithstanding these cost reductions  income from railway operations fell  and the operating ratio  a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses  rose to 
despite the decline in ns net income for  cash provided by operating activities was billion  which exceeded cash used for capital expenditures and dividends 
net proceeds from borrowings minus debt repayments was million resulting in an increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  which at december  totaled billion 
looking forward to  ns expects revenues to increase  reflecting improved average revenue per unit and higher traffic volume due to a gradual  yet steady economic recovery 
ns plans to continue to improve service and maintain a market based approach to pricing 
summarized results of operations compared with net income in was billion  or per diluted share  down million  or  compared with billion  or per diluted share  in the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income taxes see note 
railway operating revenues decreased billion  reflecting lower traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel surcharges 
railway operating expenses decreased billion  principally due to lower volume related expenses and fuel prices 
oil prices affect ns results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period 
in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume  oil prices directly affect ns revenues through market based fuel surcharges and contract escalators see railway operating revenues and also affect fuel costs see railway operating expenses 
for  excluding the impact of decreased consumption  the decline in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the decline in fuel expense 
future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter 
compared with net income in was billion  up million  or  compared with diluted earnings per share were  up  or 
the greater percentage increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of ns share repurchase program see note 
the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes see note 
railway operating revenues increased billion  as higher average revenue per unit outweighed lower traffic volumes 
railway operating expenses increased million  principally due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses 
detailed results of operations railway operating revenues railway operating revenues were billion in  billion in  and billion in the following table presents a three year comparison of revenues  volume  and average revenue per unit by market group 
revenues units revenue per unit in millions in thousands per unit coal general merchandise agr 
consumer gov t 
chemicals metals construction paper clay forest automotive general merchandise intermodal total revenues decreased billion in  but increased billion in as reflected in the table on the following page  the decrease in was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit  as a result of lower fuel surcharges that more than offset rate increases 
the improvement in was the result of increased average revenue per unit  including fuel surcharge revenue  which more than offset decreased traffic volumes 
fuel surcharge revenue amounted to million in  compared with billion in  and million in if fuel prices remain at or near year end levels  fuel surcharge revenues will increase in many of ns negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price 
these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month 
this two month lag in applying wti average price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately million in and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately million in revenue variance analysis increases decreases vs 
vs 
in millions traffic volume units revenue per unit mix total for  the unfavorable volume variance accounted for of the total variance  reflecting traffic volume declines for all commodity groups 
volumes declined by million units  or  reflecting the weakened economy 
the unfavorable revenue per unit mix variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges  offset in part by higher rates 
in  revenues increased billion compared to  reflecting large increases in average revenue per unit  a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges 
traffic volumes for all commodity groups except coal and agriculture consumer products government decreased compared to on january   the surface transportation board stb issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by ns and most other large railroads a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public tariff rates 
the stb gave the railroads a day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs 
during the second quarter of  ns discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published non intermodal public rates 
adjustments to public prices now reflect ongoing market conditions 
the traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about of ns total revenue base 
coal revenues decreased million  or  compared with  reflecting a decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit 
coal average revenue per unit was down compared with  reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment factors that more than offset rate increases 
for  average revenue per unit is expected to increase reflecting the effects of higher rates comprised of pricing increases  increasing contract escalators  higher fuel surcharges  and increased length of haul for export coal traffic 
coal represented of ns revenues in and of shipments handled originated on ns lines 
as shown in the following table  tonnage declined in all coal markets 
total coal  coke  and iron ore tonnage tons in thousands utility export domestic metallurgical industrial total in  coal revenues increased million  or  compared with  reflecting higher rates  including fuel surcharges  and a increase in traffic volume 
coal average revenue per unit was up compared with  reflecting higher rates which were comprised of pricing increases  contract escalators and the effect of increased longer haul export coal traffic and increased fuel surcharges 
ns was recently involved in litigation with virginia electric and power company old dominion electric cooperative virginia power regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them 
ns was also recently involved in litigation with a coal customer to enforce provisions of a transportation contract related to reimbursement of certain infrastructure expenses incurred by ns and minimum tonnage commitments and related deficit charges 
ns settled both of these matters during the fourth quarter of the settlements did not have a material impact on ns financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
utility coal tonnage decreased compared with  a result of lower demand for electricity induced by the downturn in the us economy  natural gas competition  and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across ns service area 
in  utility coal tonnage increased compared with  as a result of modest stockpile growth in the northeast 
for  ns expects electricity demand and natural gas prices to increase  which should lead to higher coal fired generation and demand 
however  utility coal tonnage may lag this recovery due to high stockpile levels  at least through the first half of the year 
export coal tonnage decreased compared to  reflecting the global recession  reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels 
norfolk volume decreased about  carloads  or  and baltimore volume was down about  carloads  or 
in  export coal tonnage increased compared to  primarily due to increased global demand coupled with weather related supply constraints in australia  reduced export volume from china  and the weak us dollar 
norfolk volume increased about  carloads  or  and baltimore volume was up about  carloads  or 
for  export coal tonnage is expected to increase  reflecting improved demand for raw steel production 
domestic metallurgical coal  coke  and iron ore tonnage decreased compared with  reflecting reduced demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the us economy which led to blast furnace outages  reduced coke production schedules  and high inventory levels 
in  domestic metallurgical coal  coke  and iron ore tonnage increased compared with  reflecting the start up of a new coke plant 
for  domestic metallurgical coal  coke  and iron ore tonnage is expected to improve as the economy continues to recover  resulting in increased demand for raw steel production 
other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants decreased compared to  principally due to reduced production at ns served plants caused by the downturn in the us economy 
in  other coal tonnage decreased compared to  primarily due to coal supply constraints 
for  other coal tonnage is expected to be down compared to  reflecting reduced industrial coal consumption 
general merchandise revenues in decreased billion  or  compared with  reflecting a decline in traffic volume and a decrease in average revenue per unit  as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge revenues 
in  general merchandise revenues increased million  or  compared with  as a increase in average revenue per unit  reflecting continued market based pricing and higher fuel surcharges  more than offset an decline in traffic 
agriculture  consumer products  and government revenues decreased in  compared with the revenue decline resulted from an decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn 
in  agriculture  consumer products  and government revenues increased  compared with the revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit  which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenues 
traffic volume increased as more ethanol  military  feed  soybeans  and food oils shipments offset declines in fertilizers  corn  beverages  and consumer products 
for  agriculture revenues are expected to increase as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit  reflecting expected growth in the agri fuels market  including corn for ethanol production and finished ethanol as well as increased fertilizer shipments 
chemicals revenues in decreased  compared with  due to a decrease in traffic volume and a decline in average revenue per unit  primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges 
the decline in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction which drove declines in industrial intermediates  plastics and miscellaneous chemicals 
volumes associated with petroleum based products also declined as a result of reduced demand for asphalt and production curtailments 
in  chemicals revenue increased  compared with  a result of increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue 
traffic volume declined  reflecting continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and plastics linked to housing construction declines in addition to miscellaneous chemicals and petroleum based products 
for  chemicals revenues are expected to improve  principally due to higher average revenue per unit and modestly increased traffic volumes 
metals and construction revenues decreased in  reflecting a decrease in traffic volume and a decline in average revenue per unit  primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges 
the decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil  scrap metal  iron and steel shipments  in addition to reduced demand for construction materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing  infrastructure  and automotive sectors 
in  metals and construction revenues increased as a increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge more than offset the effects of a decrease in traffic volume 
the decline in volume was due to reduced demand for construction materials and lower coil  iron  and steel shipments  reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors 
for  metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of a rise in average revenue per unit  and higher construction related traffic volumes due to growth driven by increased federal and state infrastructure projects and recovery in residential construction 
paper  clay  and forest products revenues decreased in  compared with  due to a decrease in traffic volumes and a decline in average revenue per unit  primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges 
the volume decline reflected lower pulp board  lumber  kaolin  printing paper  and wood chip shipments due to reduced u 
s 
paper production and the slowdown in the housing market 
in  paper  clay  and forest products revenues increased compared with due to a increase in average revenue per unit which more than offset an decrease in traffic volume 
the volume decline reflected the continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper customers 
for  paper  clay  and forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as slight average revenue per unit increases will be offset in part by slightly lower volumes driven by expectations for a gradual economic recovery during the course of the year as the housing market rebounds from historical lows 
automotive revenues decreased in  compared to  reflecting lower traffic volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were lower 
volumes decreased  primarily as a result of a decrease in north american light vehicle production as manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand 
in  automotive revenues decreased compared to as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit 
volumes decreased  reflecting reduced north american sales and production 
automotive manufacturers  especially the domestic producers  continued to experience significant sales declines during the year 
three assembly plants closed during the year and six implemented shift reductions 
in addition  one manufacturer temporarily closed an assembly plant to retool for a new product in for  automotive revenues are expected to increase driven by higher average revenue per unit related to network changes and the renegotiation of several contracts 
automotive volumes are expected to remain relatively flat 
intermodal revenues decreased million  or  compared with  reflecting a reduction in traffic volume and an decrease in average revenue per unit 
in  all intermodal segments experienced depressed volumes  reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer demand 
international traffic volume declined  premium business  which includes parcel and less than truckload ltl carriers  decreased  triple crown services triple crown  a service with rail to highway trailers  experienced a drop in volume  and domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies volumes decreased less than 
in  intermodal revenues increased million  or  compared with  as a increase in average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges offset a reduction in traffic volumes 
domestic volume increased compared with  reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal versus over the road transportation and service improvements 
international traffic volume declined  primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of west coast port traffic that was partially offset by east coast port volume growth 
the premium business  which includes parcel and ltl carriers  decreased  as reduced private empty movements and soft parcel business offset ltl conversions 
triple crown  a service with rail to highway trailers  experienced a drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto parts shipments 
for  intermodal revenues are expected to experience a moderate increase due to higher average revenue per unit and volumes as a result of a slowly strengthening economy 
railway operating expenses railway operating expenses in were billion  down billion  or  compared to expenses in were billion  up million  or  compared to the decrease in was primarily due to lower volume related expenses and lower fuel prices 
the increase in was primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses 
the railway operating ratio  which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses  rose to in  compared with in and in the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 
operating expense variances increases decreases vs 
vs 
in millions compensation and benefits purchased services and rents fuel depreciation materials and other total compensation and benefits  which represents of total operating expenses  decreased million  or  compared with  primarily due to lower volume related payroll down million  reduced incentive and stock based compensation down million  the absence of the cost of lump sum payments due under the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet agreement million  and  lower payroll taxes down million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased wage rates up million  increased pension costs up million  and higher medical benefits up million 
in  compensation and benefits increased million  or  compared with  primarily due to higher incentive compensation up million  increased wage rates up million  costs associated with lump sum payments due under the blet agreement  higher payroll taxes up million  and  the absence of the employment tax refund million 
these were partially offset by lower costs associated with trainees down million  lower medical benefits resulting from higher employee contributions down million  and  lower stock based compensation down million 
in  compensation and benefits expense also benefited from a net pension credit of million 
ns employment averaged  in compared with  in and  in the decrease was a direct result of volume declines during the year 
ns monitors forecasted volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure appropriate employment levels for service needs 
for  ns expects agreement wages and premiums for medical benefits  combined  will increase by approximately million compared to purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals 
this category of expenses decreased million  or  in compared to  but increased million  or  in compared to purchased services costs were billion in  billion in  and billion in the decrease in reflected lower volume related expenses such as transportation operating costs including automotive related costs and crew transportation expenses  intermodal operations costs  and mechanical and engineering expenses largely because of reduced maintenance activities 
these declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services 
the increase in reflected higher intermodal operations costs  transportation operating costs  and professional and legal services 
equipment rents  which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment  amounted to million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the decrease in and was principally due to lower shipment volumes while also reflected improved fleet utilization 
fuel expense  which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations  decreased million  or  in compared with  but increased million  or  in compared with the decline in was principally the result of lower fuel prices which had an impact of million and reduced fuel consumption which had an impact of million 
the increase in reflected higher fuel prices which had an impact of million that was offset in part by a decline in consumption which had an impact of million 
locomotive fuel prices declined in compared with a increase in  and locomotive fuel consumption was down in and in depreciation expense increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to  reflecting substantial capital investments and improvements as ns continues to invest in its infrastructure and equipment 
materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury  property damage  and environmental matters decreased million  or  in compared with  but increased million  or  in compared with  as shown in the following table 
in millions materials casualties and other claims other the decrease in reflects lower locomotive  freight car  and roadway materials expenses  lower loss and damage claims  favorable personal injury claims development  reduced employee travel costs  a million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi year state tax dispute  and the absence of the avondale mills settlement see additional discussion below 
the increase in was primarily due to costs associated with the avondale mills settlement  as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material costs for equipment and roadway repairs 
these increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury claims development 
in april  ns settled the lawsuit brought by avondale mills for claims associated with the january  derailment in graniteville  sc 
a portion of the settlement was not reimbursed by insurance and was included in expenses 
the total liability related to the derailment represents ns best estimate based on current facts and circumstances 
the estimate includes amounts related to property damage  personal injury and response costs 
ns commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and ns self insured retention  including ns response costs and legal fees 
the consolidated balance sheets reflect long term receivables for estimated recoveries from ns insurance carriers 
ns is engaged in arbitration with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by ns 
ns believes these expenses are covered by the insurance policies and recoveries of the contested amounts are probable 
accordingly  ns has recorded the full recovery attributable to each carrier million and million 
the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs 
cases involving occupational injuries comprised about of total employee injury cases resolved and about of total payments made 
with its long established commitment to safety  ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs 
with respect to occupational injuries  which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time  the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately 
these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees  some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades 
the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela s fault based system  which covers employee claims for job related injuries  produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system 
ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims 
it also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance see note 
ns expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in other income net other income net was million in  million in  and million in see note 
the increase in reflected higher net returns from corporate owned life insurance up million offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property down million 
the increase in reflected the absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel adjustments see income taxes below  reduced other interest expense million largely due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain tax examinations and higher coal royalties up million 
these benefits were offset in part by lower returns and higher borrowing costs on corporate owned life insurance down million  lower interest income down million  fewer gains on sales of property and investments down million  and lower equity in the earnings of conrail down million  which reflects the absence of a tax audit settlement recorded by conrail in million 
ns has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal 
in addition  ns purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in the production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments 
the expenses are recorded as a component of other income net and the tax credits  as well as tax benefits related to the expenses  are reflected in provision for income taxes see further discussion below 
income taxes income tax expense in was million  for an effective rate of  compared with effective rates of in and in the decrease in the rate for was primarily due to improved net returns from corporate owned life insurance and the favorable resolution of state tax issues 
the increase in the rate for was primarily due to the absence of synthetic fuel related tax credits that expired at the end of the tax credits generated by ns synthetic fuel related investments reduced the effective tax rate by in net income in reflected million in net benefits from these credits as shown below in millions effect in other income net expenses on synthetic fuel related investments effect in provision for income taxes tax credits tax benefit of expenses on synthetic fuel related investments total reduction of income tax expense effect in net income net benefit from synthetic fuel related investments bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for and but expired at the end of as a result  current taxes have been lower in recent years than might be expected in future years 
during  the internal revenue service irs concluded its examination of ns and consolidated federal income tax returns without a material effect on income tax expense 
ns consolidated federal income tax return for is being audited by the irs 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash provided by operating activities  ns principal source of liquidity  was billion in compared with billion in and billion in the decline in reflects the billion decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments 
the improvement in resulted from increased railway operating income and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current tax payments 
ns had working capital of million at december   compared with a working capital deficit of million at december  the improvement was largely due to higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances at year end  as well as the impact of lower income from railway operations that resulted in decreases in current income taxes and accounts payable  offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and increases in short term debt 
ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations 
ns cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances totaled billion and million at december  and  respectively 
contractual obligations at december   comprised of ns long term debt including capital leases see note  operating leases see note  agreements with crc and long term advances from conrail see note  unconditional purchase obligations see note  and unrecognized tax benefits see note  were as follows payments due by period and total subsequent other in millions long term debt and capital lease principal operating leases agreements with crc unconditional purchase obligations long term advances from conrail unrecognized tax benefits total when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated  the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period 
when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated  the amount is shown in the other column 
off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases  which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note cash used in investing activities was billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the increase in primarily reflected lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases  offset in part by lower property additions 
the increase in primarily reflected increased property additions 
property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category 
the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 
capital expenditures in millions road and other property equipment total track structure statistics capital and maintenance track miles of rail installed miles of track surfaced new crossties installed millions average age of owned railway equipment years freight cars locomotives retired locomotives for  ns has budgeted billion for capital expenditures 
the anticipated spending includes million for roadway projects  including the normalized replacement of rail  ties and ballast  and the improvement or replacement of bridges 
planned investments in facilities and terminals of million are primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network  including the crescent corridor initiative  and bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops 
technology investments of million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers 
the majority of the anticipated spending on technology investments is attributable to preliminary implementation of positive train control 
infrastructure investments of million are planned for various public private partnership investments such as the heartland corridor and the chicago regional environmental and transportation efficiency create project  and network improvements to increase mainline capacity and accommodate traffic growth 
ns also expects to spend million on equipment  primarily continued improvements to the locomotive fleet  including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units 
all capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds 
ns expects implementation of positive train control to result in additional capital expenditures of at least million in the years through the heartland corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless high capacity intermodal route across virginia and west virginia to midwest markets 
during  ns  the federal highway administration fhwa  and the states of ohio  west virginia and virginia entered into a memoranda of agreement with respect to the tunnel clearance component of the heartland corridor that governs the release of up to million in authorized federal funding 
in  ns also entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to million in state funding for the heartland corridor rail double stack clearance project 
ns began work on the heartland corridor tunnel clearances in october and the entire project is expected to be completed in ns expects to spend about million in in connection with this project 
the create project is a public private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area 
ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in create 
a portion of public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects to be included in phase i of the project 
a total of million in public funding has been secured for phase i and the railroads have contributed an additional million 
the railroads expect to complete phase i by the end of as currently planned  the total project is estimated to cost billion with city  state  and federal support 
if additional public funding is secured  the railroads are expected to contribute a total of million towards the entire project 
ns expects to spend approximately million in related to the create projects 
the meridian speedway is a mile rail line between meridian  mississippi and shreveport  louisiana 
on may   ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture  meridian speedway llc msllc  pursuant to which ns will contribute million in cash  substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a interest in the joint venture 
to date  ns has contributed million 
at the formation of msllc  kcs contributed the meridian speedway 
ns is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint venture s earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting 
ns total investment in msllc is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction 
the joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast 
during the second quarter of  ns and pan am railways  inc pan am formed a joint venture  pan am southern llc pas  a railroad company in which each has a equity interest 
pan am contributed to pas a mile main line track that runs between mechanicville  new york and ayer  massachusetts  along with miles of secondary and branch lines  including trackage rights in new york  connecticut  massachusetts  new hampshire  and vermont collectively  the pas lines  and as of december   ns has contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately million and committed to contribute an additional million in cash over the next three years as evidenced by the pan am notes see note 
a significant portion of ns contributions has and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the pas lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in albany  new york and the ayer  massachusetts areas 
pas is jointly controlled by ns and pan am  accordingly  ns accounts for its interest in pas using the equity method of accounting 
the crescent corridor consists of a program of improvements to infrastructure and other facilities geared toward creating a seamless  high capacity intermodal route spanning states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truck competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors  including i  i  i  i  i  and i based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief  ns plans to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor program of projects through a series of public private partnerships 
although there is not yet a single  integrated plan for the crescent corridor  preliminary work has begun and is slated to continue in  including continued infrastructure improvements and other design and engineering work along the virginia portion of the corridor consistent with ns matching obligation with respect to funds provided by the commonwealth of virginia 
if requested public private partnership agreements are funded in  ns capital expenditures in related to crescent corridor projects may be as high as million 
the midamerica corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between ns and canadian national railway cn to effectively share track between chicago  st 
louis  kentucky  and mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern us  including potential coal traffic moving to ns served southeastern utility plants from cn served illinois basin coal producers 
to implement the midamerica corridor  ns  at its option  would expend funds to upgrade the rail line operated by west tennessee railway between fulton  kentucky  and corinth  mississippi  a line over which ns would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights 
full implementation of the midamerica corridor arrangement is subject to regulatory approvals 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared with billion in  and billion in the change in reflected the absence of share repurchase activity during the period and higher borrowings net of debt repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock options and increased dividends 
due to current economic and market conditions  the amount of future share repurchases is uncertain and the timing and volume of such repurchases will be guided by management s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in reflected a net increase in debt  compared with a net decline in  which was offset in part by higher dividend payments 
during the second quarter of  ns issued million of unsecured notes at due pursuant to its automatic shelf registration statement described below see note 
the net proceeds from the offering were million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses 
ns also issued a total of million in non interest bearing notes payable with maturity dates beginning in and ending in as part of its total investment in pan am southern llc 
during the first quarter of  ns issued million of unsecured notes at due in a private offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  ns exchanged the unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under the securities act of ns has authority from its board of directors to issue an additional million of debt or equity securities through public or private sale 
during the first quarter of  ns filed a form s automatic shelf registration statement for well known seasoned issuers under which  as of december   up to million could be issued under this authority 
ns also has in place and available a billion  five year credit agreement expiring in  which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants 
ns had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december   and ns is in compliance with all of its covenants 
in october  ns renewed and amended its accounts receivable securitization program with a day term to run until october ns reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from million to million to more closely match its liquidity requirements and receivables profile 
there was million outstanding under this program at december  see note 
looking forward  ns annual debt maturities are relatively modest and stable from year to year see note 
overall  ns goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 
application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain  and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in the business environment  and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management regularly discusses the development  selection  and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 
these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets  projected increases in medical costs  and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality 
in addition  the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value 
management makes these estimates based on the company s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example  expectations of future stock market performance 
management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firm s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 
ns net pension expense  which is included in compensation and benefits in its consolidated statements of income  was million for the year ended december  in recording this amount  ns assumed a long term investment rate of return of  which was supported by the long term total rate of return on plan assets since inception 
a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a million change to the pension expense  and  as a result  an equal change in compensation and benefits expense 
changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age  projected earnings  and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension expense or net pension liability in the future 
the net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments 
ns utilizes an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds 
ns used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in these plans 
ns net cost for other postretirement benefits  which is also included in compensation and benefits  was million for the year ended december  in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits  which is included in other postretirement benefits  management estimated future increases in health care costs 
these assumptions  along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them  are described in note properties and depreciation most of ns total assets are long lived railway properties see note 
as disclosed in note  ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation 
rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton miles 
other properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives 
ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows 
assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 
ns depreciation expense is based on management s assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement 
in developing these assumptions  ns management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers 
these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices 
ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties  these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense 
the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study 
any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property 
ns depreciation expense for the year ended december   amounted to million 
ns weighted average depreciation rates for are disclosed in note  a one tenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a million increase or decrease to depreciation expense 
personal injury  environmental  and legal liabilities ns expense for casualties and other claims  included in materials and other  amounted to million for the year ended december  most of this expense was ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities 
job related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela s fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault worker s compensation system 
the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 
in all cases  ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 
to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period  ns management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm 
for employee personal injury cases  the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements  taking into account relevant outside influences 
an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability  which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims  is based on the results of this analysis 
for occupational injury claims  the actuarial firm studies ns history of claim filings  severity  payments and other relevant facts 
additionally  the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined 
ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability 
the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies 
accordingly  there could be significant changes in the liability  which ns would recognize when such a change became known 
recent actuarial studies have reflected favorable claims development and  accordingly  those changes in estimates have reduced the annual cost related to personal injuries to million in from million in while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study  it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower 
ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations 
it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 
claims  if any  against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns  are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability 
environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates 
ns also has established an environmental policy council  composed of senior managers  to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 
operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in  and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately million in and million in both and capital expenditures for environmental matters in are expected to be about million 
ns consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of million at december   and million at december  of which million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period 
at december   the liability represents ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at known locations 
as of that date  nine sites accounted for million of the liability  and no individual site was considered to be material 
ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years  however  some costs will be paid out over a longer period 
at locations  one or more ns subsidiaries  usually in conjunction with a number of other parties  have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  or comparable state statutes  which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 
with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities  estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques  the likely development of new cleanup technologies  the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant s share of any estimated loss and that participant s ability to bear it  and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability 
ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis  using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site 
as a result  it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments 
ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 
on april   the united states department of justice doj brought an action against ns for alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the january  derailment in graniteville  sc  including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief 
although ns june  motion to dismiss for failure to allege sufficient facts was granted  doj was given leave to  and did  amend its complaint 
the litigation has been stayed by the district court as the parties work to conclude an agreed upon consent decree 
ns does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known  management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which ns is aware 
further  management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations 
when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued through a charge to expenses 
while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion the recorded liability  if any  is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims 
however  the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter 
any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
income taxes ns net long term deferred tax liability totaled billion at december  see note 
this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns 
for state income and other taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
ns had a million valuation allowance on million of deferred tax assets as of december   reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized 
in addition  ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and  if so  judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded 
for every one half percent change in the effective tax rate  net income would have changed by million 
other matters labor agreements more than of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions 
these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla 
ns largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads 
moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes 
ns reached national agreements that extended through with all of the major rail unions 
the current agreement with the blet extends through because ns has reached separate agreements with the blet and the american train dispatchers association atda  only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to ns locomotive engineers and atda represented dispatchers 
ns has also reached agreement with longshoremen at ashtabula ohio docks who are represented by the international longshoremen s association ila and do not participate in national bargaining 
on or after november   ns and the nation s other major carriers served new proposals to begin the next round of negotiations 
the outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point 
market risks and hedging activities ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 
at december   ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled million 
a point increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately million 
management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
some of ns capital leases  which carry an average fixed rate of  were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements 
on december   the average pay rate under these agreements was  and the average receive rate was 
during and  the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by less than million in both periods 
a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen 
ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation 
most of these deposits are held by foreign banks  primarily japanese 
as a result  ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan 
counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 
inflation in preparing financial statements  us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property 
ns  a capital intensive company  has most of its capital invested in such property 
the replacement cost of these assets  as well as the related depreciation expense  would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 
proposed legislation and regulations on safety and transportation of hazardous materials federal regulations were adopted in late on safety and transportation of hazardous materials 
ns is in compliance with those regulations currently effective and expects to be in compliance with those regulations to become effective at a later date 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like believe  expect  anticipate  and project 
forward looking statements reflect management s good faith evaluation of information currently available 
however  such statements are dependent on and  therefore  can be influenced by  a number of external variables over which management has little or no control  including domestic and international economic conditions  interest rates  the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight  competition and consolidation within the transportation industry  the operations of carriers with which ns interchanges  acts of terrorism or war  fluctuation in prices of key materials  in particular diesel fuel  labor difficulties  including strikes and work stoppages  legislative and regulatory developments  results of litigation  changes in securities and capital markets  disruptions to ns technology infrastructure  including computer systems  and natural events such as severe weather  hurricanes  and floods
