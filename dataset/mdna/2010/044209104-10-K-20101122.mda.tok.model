ashland transfers under the facility are accounted for as secured borrowings and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable 
borrowings under the facility will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected  with new borrowings created as and when cvg requests additional fundings from the investors under the transfer and administration agreement  which will generally occur on a monthly basis 
once sold to cvg  the accounts receivable  related assets and rights to collection described above will be separate and distinct from ashland s own assets and will not be available to its creditors should ashland become insolvent 
ashland s equity interest in cvg has been pledged to the lenders under ashland s new senior secured credit facilities described above

in conjunction with the senior credit facilities refinancing  ashland expanded the availability of the accounts receivable securitization facility from million to million  subject to available funding from qualifying receivables 
the net proceeds from the refinancing  along with utilization from ashland s existing receivables securitization facility million of available million drawn at close  were used to pay off ashland s previously existing term loan b due and refinance ashland s existing revolving credit facility due and term loan a due total borrowing capacity remaining under the new million revolving credit facility was million  which was reduced by million for letters of credit outstanding at september  additionally  at september   ashland had approximately million in available funding from qualifying receivables sold to a wholly owned accounts receivable securitization facility 
in total  ashland s available liquidity position  which includes cash  the revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facility  was  million at september  the current portion of long term debt was million at september  and million at september  based on ashland s current debt structure included in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements and assuming interest rates remain stable  future annual book interest expense could range from approximately million to million based on applicable fixed and floating interest rates 
auction rate securities at september  and  ashland held at par value million and million  respectively  in student loan auction rate securities for which there was not an active market with consistent observable inputs 
in february  the auction rate securities market became largely illiquid  as there was not enough demand to purchase all of the securities that holders desired to sell at par value during certain auctions 
since this time  the market for auction rate securities has failed to achieve equilibrium 
as of september   ashland had recorded  as a component of stockholders equity  a temporary million unrealized loss on the portfolio 
as of that date  all the student loan instruments held by ashland were aaa rated and collateralized by student loans whic h are substantially guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
ashland s estimate of fair value for auction rate securities as of september  was based on various internal discounted cash flow models and relevant observable market prices and quotes 
the assumptions within the models include credit quality  liquidity  estimates on the probability of each valuation model and the impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates 
during the first quarter of  ashland liquidated million par value auction rate securities for million in cash proceeds and recognized a loss of million  which was the recorded book value of this instrument 
as a result of this sale  as well as ashland s debt structure following the hercules acquisition and the ongoing impact from the global economic downturn  ashland determined in the first quarter that it no longer had the intent to hold these instruments until their maturity date 
as a result  ashland recorded the remaining million unrealized loss as a permanent realized loss in the other expenses caption of the consolidated statement of income 
a full valuation allowance was established for this tax benefit at december  because for tax purposes ashland did no t have capital gains to offset this capital loss 
for further information on income taxes  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following details the auction rate securities sold during and in millions par value cash received gain or loss at september  and  auction rate securities were recorded at million and million  respectively  and were classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
due to the uncertainty as to when active trading will resume in the auction rate securities market  ashland continues to believe the recovery period for certain of these securities may extend beyond a twelve month period 
capital resources during  ashland s total debt decreased by million to  million 
since the acquisition of hercules in november  ashland has primarily used its cash generated from operations to reduce debt by more than billion 
debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  compared to at september  stockholders equity increased million to  million 
this increase was primarily due to the voluntary common stock contribution of million made in november to ashland s us pension plans and net income of million 
these increases were partially offset by regular cash dividends of million  deferred translation losses of million and pension and postretirement obligations of million 
m during the third quarter of fiscal  the board of directors of ashland announced and paid a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was double the previous quarterly dividend of cents per share paid in the first two quarters of fiscal and all four quarters in fiscal in conjunction with ashland s existing debt facilities  ashland is subject to various covenants that may restrict certain future payments  which could include quarterly dividend payments  although ashland does not anticipate that will occur 
ashland did not repurchase any outstanding common shares during  or in  ashland made a voluntary pension plan contribution of approximately million shares of ashland common stock  valued at million on the date of transfer as described above 
in  as part of the completed merger to acquire all of the outstanding shares of hercules in november  ashland issued million shares 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisition 
at september  and  million and million common shares  respectively  were reserved for issuance under stock incentive and deferred compensation plans 
capital expenditures were million for and averaged million during the last three years 
under the new senior credit facilities agreement entered into in march  ashland is no longer subject to a capital expenditure limit  which under the previous financing arrangements was approximately million in fiscal year ashland is currently forecasting approximately million of capital expenditures for fiscal funded primarily from operating cash flows 
during  ashland used million in capital to acquire the remaining interest in ara quimica  a leading producer of custom unsaturated polyester resin formulations for the composites industry in south america and part of the performance materials business segment 
during  ashland used  milli on in capital and million in stock to obtain hercules aqualon included within the functional ingredients business segment and paper technologies and ventures included within the water technologies business segment businesses 
during  ashland used capital to acquire several businesses within performance materials  including air products  which totaled million 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed functional ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets distribution m contractual obligations and other commitments the following table aggregates ashland s obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable have been excluded

d capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included within this caption 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
e includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments 
variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of september  f due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities  ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties 
therefore  these amounts were principally included in the later years column 
g ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on ashland  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under differ ent assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
m long lived assets tangible assets the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings are depreciated principally over to years and machinery and equipment principally over to years 
ashland reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectati on that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carr ying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
asset impairment charges are included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and were million in  million in and million in total depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation expense for and included million and million in accelerated depreciation related to the closure of plant facilities  included within the cost of sales caption of the statements of consolidated income  while did not have a charge 
capitalized interest for and was million and million  respectively  and was not significant for goodwill in accordance with us gaap  ashland reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment either annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
this annual assessment is performed as of july and consists of ashland determining each reporting unit s current fair value compared to its current carrying value 
ashland has determined that its reporting units for allocation of goodwill include the functional ingredients  water technologies  consumer markets and distribution reportable segments 
within the performance materials reportable segment  because further discrete financial information is provided and management regularly reviews this information  this reportable segment is further broken down into the casting solutions and composite polymers s pecialty polymers and adhesives reporting units 
goodwill associated with each of these reporting units as of september  was  million for functional ingredients  million for water technologies  million for consumer markets  million for distribution  million for castings solutions  and million for composites and adhesives 
when externally quoted market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units through the use of discounted cash flow models 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions 
significant assumptions ashland utilized in these models for the current year included projected business results and future industry direction  long term growth factors ranging from to and weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to 
ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be conservative estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to ashland s market capitalization  and implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of goodwill  ashland s valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment 
each reporting unit s fair value was significantly over its carrying values  except for the functional ingredients reporting unit  whose calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the current year discounted cash flow model  a negative change in either the long term growth factor or weighted average cost of capital assumptions for this reporting unit would have resulted in a fair value approximately at its current carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of functional ingredients within the model  ashland assumed a long term growth factor of  which was consis tent with the prior year s model 
in addition  ashland utilized a weighted average cost of capital of for the current year model  which is a slight decrease from the m utilized in the prior year s model 
the current year s weighted average cost of capital of is considered by ashland to be a conservative adjustment from the prior year s rate based on ashland s significantly lower overall weighted average borrowing rate at september  of compared to the september  rate of  as well as generally the overall lower interest rate environment that currently exists in the credit markets 
ashland believes that the current fair value results of the functional ingredients reporting unit are positive given that this business was just purchased and recorded at fair value in early fiscal the current year discounted cash flow model result  which is a significant increase in fair value over the previous year s mode l  indicates the business is capitalizing on growth opportunities and cost synergies that existed at the outset of the purchase of the business 
assuming no changes in key assumptions identified  ashland currently anticipates the future fair value of the functional ingredients reporting unit to continue to increase over time 
ashland did compare and assess the total fair values of the reporting units to ashland s market capitalization at the annual assessment date  including the implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
while ashland s current market capitalization total approximates its current carrying value  the discounted cash flow models for each reporting unit summed together exceeded ashland s carrying value by a significant amount as of ashland s annual impairment testing date 
ashland believes its use of significant assumptions within its valuation models are reasonable estimates of likely future events 
because the fair value results for each reporting unit did not indicate a potential impairment existed  ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during   and subsequent to this annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
other indefinite lived intangible assets other indefinite lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names 
these assets had a balance of million as of september  ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
ashland tests these indefinite lived intangible assets  using a relief from royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value 
significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include  but are not limited to  such estimates as projected business results  growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to  royalty and discount rates ranging from to 
in conjunctio n with the july annual assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets  ashland s models did not indicate any impairment  as each indefinite lived intangible asset s fair value exceeded their carrying values 
ashland s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives  including goodwill  could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit divestiture decision  negative change in ashland s weighted average cost of capital rates  growth rates or other assumptions  economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated  or another significant economic event

employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover a majority of employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during those years of service 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
for further information  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  in conjunction with the purchase of hercules  ashland assumed million and million of net liabilities associated with qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans  respectively 
the assumed hercules pension plan had a projected benefit obligation of  million as of the acquisition date 
ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the mercer pension discount yield curve spot rates 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans m and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  for and for the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be in  in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to a gain of in and a loss of in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
ashland estimates total fiscal pension costs for us and non us pension plans to be approximately million  and expects to contribute million to its non us pension plans and approximately million to its non us pension plans in cash 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions a increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate a excludes hercules pension and other postretirement plans assumed during as part of its acquisition by ashland 
income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
 the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from ashland s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material affect on the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by ashland 
if actual results differ from the estimates made by ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset 
additionally  the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which includes such evidence as historical earnings  projected future earnings  tax planning strategies  and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences 
m in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities other than those with an indefinite reversal period  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial operations 
ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative income or loss 
in addition  ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
as a result of the hercules acquisition during  significant historical tax positions and structures related to hercules have been combined within ashland 
some of these previous tax positions and structures from hercules required a complete reassessment regarding certain of ashland s pre acquisition tax positions and structures 
as such  material changes in certain tax matters may occur in the future based on deviations from ashland s current estimates and assumptions in combining these tax positions and structures

asbestos related litigation ashland and hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions  ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense 
the claim experience of ashland and hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
 those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ashland asbestos related litigation the claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent update completed during  it was determined that the reserve adjustment for asbestos claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  excluding the hercules asbestos claims further described below  ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
for the ashland asbestos related obligations  ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best  as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  whose insurance policy obligations have been transferred to a berkshire hathaway enti ty 
during fiscal  ashland entered into a new agreement with a number of london market insurance companies with respect to coverage for asbestos related insurance claims 
as a result  a million increase to the ashland asbestos receivable was recorded within the consolidated balance sheet  which had a million after tax effect on the statement of consolidated income within the discontinued operations caption 
as a result of this agreement and other revised estimates  ashland no longer discounts any portion of the asbestos receivable at this time 
m at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million excluding the hercules receivable for asbestos claims  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers  was updated 
this model update along with potential settlement adjustments caused an additional million net increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
hercules asbestos related litigation hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in november  ashland completed its acquisition of hercules 
at that time  hercules recorded reserve for asbestos claims was million for indemnity costs 
hercules accounting policy in recording reserves for asbestos claims was to reserve at the lowest level of an estimated range of exposure for indemnity claims  excluding estimates of future litigation defense costs 
ashland s accounting policy in recording reserves for asbestos claims is to include amounts for the best estimate of projected indemnity and litigation defense costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
as a result  ashland recorded a million increase to the asbestos reserve for hercules to include projected defense costs 
to do so  ashland utilized several internal models that it employs to estimate defense costs associated with asbestos claims 
during  ashland included the hercules claims within its annual assessment of these matters  which includes running various non inflated  non discounted approximate year models developed with the assistance of hr a and determining from the range of estimates in the models the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
based on ashland s assessment of the best estimate of the range of exposure from the most recent model results  an additional million increase was recorded  which was accounted for as an adjustment to hercules opening balance sheet because the adjustment related to claims that had been incurred as of the acquisition date 
during december  ashland essentially completed the final valuation of the hercules asbestos claims liability existing as of the acquisition date and underlying claim files as part of transitioning to a standardized claims management approach 
this assessment resulted in a million and million reduction to the asbestos liability and receivable  respectively  which was accounted for as an adjustment to hercules opening balance sheet since the adjustment related to claims that had been incurred as of the acquisition date 
during the most recent update  completed during  it was determined that the liability for asbestos claims should be reduced by million 
based upon review of the assumptions underlying the asbestos valuation model and the most recent claim filing and settlement trend rates for both pre and post acquisition periods  ashland determined that million of the million adjustment should be recorded to goodwill  which was partially offset by million for a decrease in probable insurance recoveries  totaling to a net million adjustment to goodwill 
total reserves for hercules asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  as of ashland s acquisition date of hercules  all of the cash previously recovered and placed into a trust from the settlements with certain of hercules insurance carriers had been exhausted 
with the addition of estimated defense and indemnity costs  the total hercules asbestos reserve exceeded the amount needed to obtain reimbursements pursuant to coverage in place agreements with certain other insurance carriers 
accordingly  ashland recorded a million receivable within the noncurrent asbestos insurance receivable caption of the consolidated balance sheet 
upon completion of the annual update during  the receivable was reduced by million  million of which was recorded to goodwill 
receivables from insurers amounted to million and million as of septemb er  and  respectively 
as of september   this estimated receivable exclusively consists of domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a

asbestos litigation cost projection projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of thes e inherent uncertainties  ashland believes that the asbestos m reserves for ashland and hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models was developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has currently estimated in various approximate year models that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately million for the ashland asbestos related litigat ion and approximately million for the hercules asbestos related litigation or approximately billion in the aggregate  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
environmental remediation ashland and hercules are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland and or hercules have been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the hercules acquisition on november   ashland assumed all hercules environmental and asset retirement obligation contingencies 
hercules obligations assumed by ashland were million  which includes an increase of million for different remediation approaches than previously assumed under hercules valuation models 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland discounts certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surro unding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and  ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation expense is included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and on an aggregate basis amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation expense  net of insurance receivables  was million in  million in and million in environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites is approximately mil lion  which includes the hercules sites 
no individual remediation location is material  as the largest reserve for any site is less than of the remediation reserve 
outlook during  ashland completed the last major step of the hercules integration  implementing the common saptm enterprise resource planning system across the organization  while also refinancing its debt structure  to take advantage of lower rate instruments

however  persistent raw material cost inflation impacted results from certain businesses  to varying degrees  throughout the year 
m raw materials cost increases within functional ingredients continued to escalate throughout the past year  and combined with lower selling prices have resulted in a gross profit margin decline from historical levels 
however  current and anticipated pricing actions should allow for these margins within this business to return to its historical levels

ashland expects the new nanjing facility in china  which will become operational early in fiscal  to help alleviate these shortages in certain products  while serving as a long term platform for growth within the asia market 
this new facility is expected to initially cause some margin decline in the upcoming year until it becomes fully utilized

effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
as of september   ashland s monetary assets currently exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the us in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflati onary pressures seem moderate 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological m improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs
