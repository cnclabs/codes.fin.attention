executive overview our results reflect the difficult economic conditions that continue to exist in the real estate and financial markets 
in response to these conditions  we have focused on efforts to improve our cash flows from operations by deliberately reducing the number of voi sales transactions for which we provide financing and to increase our selling and marketing efficiencies in our resorts division 
we also sought to pursue opportunities to grow our cash fee based service businesses 
while our cash flows from operations and our resorts division segment operating margin reflects the success of these efforts  the communities division continued to struggle given the low consumer demand for homesites 
in addition to these factors  the following had a significant financial impact on us during we recorded a million loss on the sale of four of our golf courses 
our communities division generated a segment operating loss of million  including a non cash charge of million associated with the write down of certain completed inventory to net realizable value 
we recorded a charge of approximately million related to attorney fees and other costs associated with previous efforts to seek alternative liquidity source for our receivables  which we are no longer presently pursuing 
we recognized a non recurring tax benefit of million  as a result of certain book and tax differences becoming permanent 
the following table details the contribution to consolidated sales of real estate by the reportable segments for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended december  sales of real estate of total sales sales of real estate of total sales sales of real estate of total sales bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities total as we discuss further under liquidity and capital resources  our resorts sales operations are materially dependent on the availability of liquidity in the credit markets 
historically  we have provided financing to a significant portion of our bluegreen resorts customers 
such financing typically involves the consumer making a minimum cash down payment  with the balance being financed over a ten year period 
as bluegreen resorts selling  general and administrative expenses typically exceed the cash down payment  we have historically maintained credit facilities pursuant to which we pledged or sold our consumer notes receivable 
furthermore  we also engaged in private placement term securitization transactions to periodically pay down all or a portion of our note receivable credit facilities 
there has been and continues to be an unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that has made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and  if available  more expensive 
for most of  the term securitization market was severely limited and  as a result  financial institutions have been and continue to be reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables 
several lenders to the timeshare industry  including certain of our lenders  have announced that they will either be exiting the finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future 
in addition  financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt have generally been unavailable to us 
while we believe that the market for our resorts product remains relatively strong  we are continuing to deemphasize our sales operations to conserve cash because of the uncertainties in the credit markets 
in an effort to conserve cash and availability under our receivables credit facilities  we implemented strategic initiatives which have included closing certain sales offices  eliminating what we identified as lower efficiency marketing programs  emphasizing cash sales and higher cash down payments as well as pursuing other cash based services  reducing overhead  including eliminating a significant number of staff positions across a variety of areas at various locations  limiting sales to borrowers who meet newly applied underwriting standards  and increasing interest rates on new sales transactions for which we provide financing 
our goal is to reduce the number of sales while increasing the ultimate profitability of the sales we do make 
additional information on our strategic initiatives is provided in liquidity and capital resources below 
we believe that we have adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy our projected sales for and based on anticipated sales levels  for a number of years thereafter 
we continue to actively pursue additional credit facility capacity  capital markets transactions  and alternative financing solutions  and we hope that the steps we are taking will position us to maintain our existing credit relationships as well as attract new sources of capital 
regardless of the state of the credit markets  we believe that our resorts management and finance operations will continue to represent recurring cash generating sources of income which do not require material liquidity support from the credit markets 
while the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive  our goal is to leverage our sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  resort management  title and construction expertise to generate fee based service relationships with third parties that produce strong cash flows and require less capital investment 
during  we began providing resort management services to four resorts under these agreements 
in addition  since july we sold million of outside developer inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of approximately million  as well as title fees on such transactions 
we have also begun providing resort design and development services and mortgage services under certain of these arrangements 
we intend to pursue additional fee based services relationships and believe that these activities will become an increasing portion of our business over time 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and results of operations 
this seasonality may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
although we expect to see more potential customers at our sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september  ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to complex down payment requirements for recognition of real estate sales under gaap or due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have had a material impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we have increased the sales prices of our vois periodically and have experienced increased construction and development costs from time to time during the last several years 
there is no assurance that we will be able to increase or maintain the current level of our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our vois and homesites adversely impacts consumer demand  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  to the extent inflationary trends  tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates  our debt service costs may increase 
our bluegreen communities business has been  and continues to be  adversely impacted by the deterioration in the real estate markets 
we have experienced a material decrease in demand  and a significant decrease in sales volume 
during we significantly reduced prices on certain of our completed homesites in an attempt to increase sales activity  and such reductions have adversely impacted the carrying costs of our communities inventories 
there can be no assurances that future changes in our intentions or pricing will not result in future material inventory valuation adjustments 
we have historically financed a majority of bluegreen resorts sales of vois  and accordingly  are subject to the risk of defaults by customers 
gaap requires that we reduce sales of vois by our estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated voi receivables  excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses by division as of december  and was as follows in thousands bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities total december  notes receivable allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable december  notes receivable allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable the table below sets forth the activity in our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable for the year ended december  in thousands balance  december  provision for loan losses less write offs of uncollectible receivables balance  december  includes provision for loan losses on homesite notes receivable we believe that rising unemployment in the united states and adverse economic conditions in general have adversely impacted the performance of our notes receivable portfolio 
however  we anticipate that credit underwriting standards on new loan originations which we implemented in december and increasing customer equity in the existing loan portfolio will have a favorable impact on the performance of the portfolio over time 
the average annual default rates and delinquency rates more than days past due on bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities receivables owned or serviced by us were as follows average annual default rates year ended december  division bluegreen resorts loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  bluegreen communities delinquency rates as of december  division bluegreen resorts loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  bluegreen communities as of december  we were in the process of foreclosing on a total of nine bluegreen communities receivables 
had we completed the foreclosure process in  the bluegreen communities average annual default rate would have been approximately during and the delinquency rate would have been approximately as of december  the percentage of our serviced voi notes receivable portfolio that was over days past due as of the dates indicated 
reflects the impact of our credit underwriting standards as well as our policy that loans are not defaulted until after days past due 
substantially all defaulted vacation ownership notes receivable result in the holder of the note receivable recovering the related voi that secured the note receivable  typically soon after default and at little or no cost 
in cases where bluegreen has retained ownership of the vacation ownership note receivable  the voi is recovered and resold in the normal course of business 
in most cases the resales of the voi s partially mitigate the loss from the default  as these recoveries generally range from approximately to of the defaulted principal balance depending on the age of the defaulted receivable 
we may also remarket voi s relating to defaulted receivables on behalf of note holders in exchange for a remarketing fee designed to approximate our sales and marketing costs 
from time to time  we will reacquire a defaulted note receivable from one of our off balance sheet term securitization or purchase facility transactions by substituting the defaulted receivable for a performing receivable 
the related voi that secured the defaulted note receivable is reacquired at a price equal to the defaulted principal amount  which typically is in excess of our historical cost of product 
the reacquisition of inventory in this manner has resulted in an increase in bluegreen resort s cost of sales 
in advance of new accounting rules which became effective january   a decision was made in to structure any sales of notes receivable after that time so they are treated as on balance sheet borrowings 
this impacts the comparability to prior periods as transactions structured in this way do not result in gains on sales of notes receivable 
a significant portion of our revenues historically was comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the gains were recorded on our consolidated statement of operations as a component of sales of real estate and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
see further discussion below in accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for discussion of the anticipated impact of new accounting rules 
the deteriorating credit markets have negatively impacted our financing activities 
during and the majority of  fewer securitization and hypothecation transactions were consummated in the market overall  and those that were consummated were more difficult to effect and were priced at a higher cost than in prior periods 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure financing for our voi notes receivable on acceptable terms  if at all 
during  we renewed or extended certain of our existing credit facilities and debt maturities and are in the process of negotiating an additional significant debt extension see the liquidity and capital resources section for further information 
in connection with such renewals and extensions we have  in certain cases  agreed to pay higher interest rates and fees 
in addition  conditions in the commercial credit markets are expected to increase interest rates on new debt we may obtain from time to time in the future 
any such increased interest rates would increase our expenses and adversely impact our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely impacted 
revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
in accordance with the requirements of acs or sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  as amended by the timeshare accounting rules sfas no 
regarding voi sales  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
under timeshare accounting rules  the buyer s minimum cash down payment towards the purchase of our vois is met only if the cash down payment received  reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale  is at least of the sales price 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type  or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may result in additional voi sales being deferred  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
the timeshare accounting rules define a specific method of the relative sales value method for relieving voi inventory and recording cost of sales 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed voi inventory  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
for communities real estate projects  costs are allocated to individual homesites in the communities projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each homesite without regard to defaults or repossessed inventory 
under this method  the allocated cost of a homesite is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon recognition of the related sale 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
carrying value of completed inventory 
our completed timeshare and homesite inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
on at least a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our completed inventory and if necessary  adjust such amounts to net realizable value 
during and  as a result of our evaluation of certain completed communities division real estate  we recorded charges totaling million and million  respectively  to write down such inventory to net realizable value 
allowance for loan losses on voi notes receivable 
we estimate uncollectible voi notes receivable based on historical uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period 
we use a static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
additionally  under timeshare accounting requirements  no consideration is given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible voi notes receivable 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
if defaults increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
transfers of financial assets and valuation of retained interests 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell voi notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to accounting rules in place at the time of the transaction 
the evaluation of sale treatment involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie  put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates us to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales 
as indicated below in recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  should we be successful in selling additional notes receivable in the future  such transactions will be evaluated under new rules which become effective on january  accordingly  we do not expect to recognize any future gains on the sale of notes receivable 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches and rights to excess interest spread  which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable has depended in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate the fair value of our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized other than temporary decreases totaling approximately million in the fair market value of certain of our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
the overall decrease in the fair value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable sold in was a result of higher discount rates and unfavorable changes to our estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows from our retained interests 
the higher discount rate during reflects an increase in our estimate of the required yield by a potential investor in our residual interests as of december  carrying value of real estate held for development and under development and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets  and our undeveloped real estate properties or real estate properties under development  if certain trigger events occur 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
our assessment consists of determining recoverability of our costs based on our plans and upon a combination of factors including estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project  the period required to complete such sales  estimates of costs to complete each project  if needed  and various other factors including relevant market data 
should our estimates of these factors or our plans change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
which has subsequently been renamed asc  which became effective for us on january  fasb asc eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets 
it also requires the disclosure of more information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions and transactions where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to the transferred financial assets 
see discussion of sfas no 
 below  for the anticipated impact on bluegreen of the adoption of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r which has subsequently been renamed asc  which became effective for us on january  asc addresses the effects of eliminating the qualified special purpose entity qspe concept and responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of previous accounting rules  including concerns over the transparency of an enterprise s involvement with variable interest entities vies 
as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement on january   we expect that we will in the future be required to consolidate our qspes described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we expect to record a one time non cash after tax adjustment to shareholders equity in the first quarter of of approximately million to million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect will consist primarily of the reversal of previously recognized sales of notes receivable  the recognition of the related non recourse receivable backed notes payable  the elimination of retained interest in notes receivable sold  and adjustments to inventory and deferred income taxes payable as a result of these changes 
we anticipate that our adoption of these standards will have the following impacts on our balance sheet assets will increase by approximately million to million  liabilities will increase by approximately million to million  and shareholders equity will decrease by approximately million to million 
results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities

see corporate general and administrative expenses below for further discussion 
includes sales of voi s made on behalf of third parties  which are effected through the same process as the sale of our vacation ownership inventory  and involve similar selling and marketing costs 
bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bluegreen resorts resort sales and marketing the following table sets forth certain information for sales of both bluegreen vois and voi sales made on behalf of outside developers for a fee for the periods indicated

bluegreen resorts gross voi sales prior to the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and gain on sale of notes receivable decreased million  or  during as compared to  reflecting the deliberate down sizing of our sales and marketing operations through the operation of fewer sales offices and our decision to focus on what we believe are relatively higher efficiency marketing programs 
sales to owners accounted for of resorts sales during as compared to during additionally  although we purposely reduced the number of prospect tours during  we believe these tours were more successful as our sale to tour conversion ratio for new prospects increased to during from during approximately million of gains on sales of voi notes receivable in are reflected as an increase to voi sales 
no such gains were recognized during as discussed in detail throughout this annual report  we do not anticipate that  in general  any future transfer of our notes receivable will be structured as  or otherwise qualify for  sales treatment 
instead  such transactions will most likely be accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
accordingly  we do not expect to recognize future gains on the sale of notes receivable 
while we believe the on balance sheet treatment for the sale of notes receivable provides more transparent results  our results of operations and operating cash flows are negatively impacted compared to those periods in which the transfer of receivables was treated as a sale 
voi revenue was reduced by our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable of million and million during and  respectively 
these estimates vary with the amount of financed sales during the periods  as well as by our estimate of future note receivable performance 
bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the vois sold 
gross margin during as compared to was negatively impacted by the sale of higher cost vois  a result of a change in the mix of inventory sold and the relatively higher cost of vois reacquired in connection with consumer loan defaults on certain previously sold notes receivable 
sales and marketing fee based services 
in september  we began selling and marketing third parties vacation ownership inventory for a fee one of our fee based services 
these sales are effected through the same process as the sale of our vacation ownership inventory  and entail similar selling and marketing costs with respect to these efforts 
we earn our commission upon closing of the sales transaction and are generally paid our cash fees within days 
during  we sold million of outside developer inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these fee based services  we believe we generated approximately million in pre tax profit by providing these sales and marketing fee based services in we anticipate that fee based services will be a greater portion of our revenues and profits in the future 
as a result of fewer tours and the operation of fewer sales offices  selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts decreased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in a higher tour to sale conversion rate and a higher proportion of sales in to existing owners  which carry a relatively lower marketing cost  reduced selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales 
we believe that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross voi sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurance can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not increase as a percentage of gross voi sales in future periods 
general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts decreased million  or  during as compared to  the result of operating fewer sales offices 
as a percentage of sales  field general and administrative expenses increased from during to in as of december   approximately million and million of sales and segment operating profit  respectively  were deferred under the applicable timeshare accounting rules because such sales did not yet meet the minimum required buyer s initial investment 
this compares to million and million of sales and segment operating profit  respectively  deferred as of december  resort management and other services the following table sets forth pre tax profit generated by our resort management and other services in thousands for the year ended december  resort management operations title operations net carrying cost of developer inventory other total resort management operations gross profit increased million  or  during as compared to  as a result of additional fees earned by providing services to more bluegreen vacation club members and from managing more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations

gross profit generated from our title operations fluctuates based upon the number of voi sales transactions processed by our title company subsidiary and on the mix of voi inventory sold third party closing costs vary by the location of underlying real estate sold 
the decrease in profit during  as compared to reflects the decrease in sales 
we intend to continue to pursue our efforts to provide resort management and title services to third party resort developers and others  on a cash fee basis 
while there is no assurance that we will be successful  we hope that this will become an increasing portion of our business over time 
the carrying costs of our voi inventory include maintenance fees and developer subsidies on vois in our inventory paid to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
we partially mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned voi units 
accordingly  the net carrying cost of developer inventory fluctuates with the number of voi units we hold and the number of resorts subject to a developer subsidy arrangement during a period  as well as revenue from rental and sampler activity realized 
during the years ended december  and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was off set by rental sampler revenue  net of expenses  of million and million  respectively  during those periods 
the carrying cost of developer inventory increased in primarily as a result of the opening of our resorts in las vegas  nevada and williamsburg  virginia in the summer of bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bluegreen resorts resort sales and marketing the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and the deferral of sales in accordance with timeshare accounting rules for the year ended december  number of voi sales transactions average sales price per transaction number of total prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio total prospects number of new prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio new prospects bluegreen resorts gross voi sales prior to the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and gain on sale of notes receivable increased million  or  during as compared to primarily due to our continued focus on marketing to our bluegreen vacation club owner base

the majority of these gains represent the reversal of amounts previously recognized as estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
while the overall decrease in gain on sale of voi notes receivable in as compared to was primarily the result of lower off balance sheet receivable sales during compared to million of loans in compared to million in  as a percentage of notes receivable sold  the gain decreased in due to higher interest rates required by investors in the securitization market 
the increase in gross voi revenue was further reduced by an increase of million  or  in our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable primarily due to higher gross voi sales in as compared to  and a higher default experience 
bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
gross margin during as compared to was positively impacted by sales of vois located at our bluegreen wilderness traveler at shenandoah resort  which has a relatively low cost  and to a lesser extent  by a system wide price increase during the first quarter of selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million  or  during as compared to the overall increase in selling and marketing expenses during as compared to reflected the overall increase in sales and a general increase in overall marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of the recognition of smaller gains on sale recorded as a component of revenue in as compared to  partially offset by increased sales to existing owners  which generally carry lower marketing costs  and a slightly higher sale to tour conversion rate

during the years ended december  and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was off set by rental sampler revenue  net of expenses  of million and million  respectively  during those periods 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we implemented strategic initiatives in the resort division that are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources 
restructuring charges incurred as a result of implementing our strategic initiatives were as follows in thousands charges during severance and benefit related costs lease termination obligation fixed assets write downs  net of proceeds other total restructuring includes severance payments made to employees  payroll taxes and other benefit related costs in connection with the terminations of over  employees  as applicable 
includes costs associated with noncancelable property and equipment leases that we have ceased to use  as well as termination fees related to the cancellation of certain contractual lease obligations 
included in this amount are future minimum lease payments in excess of estimated sublease income  fees and expenses for which the provisions of asc which relate to the accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities were satisfied 
includes write downs of million and million for leasehold improvements and property and equipment  respectively  net of a nominal amount of cash received in connections with selling assets 
goodwill impairment in  we recorded million of goodwill related to the business acquisitions for bluegreen resorts  increasing total goodwill to million 
during the year ended december   we completed the required annual impairment testing of the goodwill recorded in our bluegreen resorts reporting unit 
as a result of our annual impairment testing of goodwill for the year ended december   we determined that the fair value of our bluegreen resorts reporting units  based on our overall market capitalization  could not support the book value of goodwill 
accordingly  we wrote off the balance of our goodwill and recorded a charge of million 
bluegreen communities year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  and excluding sales of bulk parcels year ended december  december  number of homesites sold average sales price per homesite communities sales decreased million  or  during  as compared to sales at bluegreen communities have been  and continue to be  adversely impacted by the deterioration of the economy generally and the real estate markets  in particular 
we have experienced continued low demand  especially in our higher priced premium homesites 
throughout  we continued to significantly reduce prices on completed homesites at certain communities 
the decline in our average sales price per homesite in from reflects the sale of reduced price homesites as well as increased sales at communities with lower price levels 
before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and state rescission statutes  during  we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during the tables below set forth information with respect to contracts to sell homesites at december  in thousands contracts to sell property at projects not substantially sold out at december  project difference vintage oaks at the vineyard havenwood at hunter s crossing lake ridge at joe pool lake king oaks chapel ridge the bridges at preston crossings sugar tree on the brazos sanctuary cove total project contracts to sell property at projects substantially sold out at december  difference mystic shores saddle creek forest miscellaneous total total contracts bluegreen communities sales were increased as a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting by million and million during and  respectively 
as a result of our decreased volume  reduced prices  and the impact of reduced sales on the forecasted sell out period of our projects  we recorded non cash charges to cost of real estate sales of approximately million and million during and  respectively  to write down the inventory balances of certain phases of our communities properties  to their estimated net realizable value 
we calculated the estimated net realizable value of these properties based on our analysis of their estimated future cash flows  given what we believe to be reasonable assumptions 
should the real estate market decline further  or if other factors change our assumptions about the future  it may be necessary to record additional charges with respect to these or other projects in the future 
excluding the inventory charges  bluegreen communities gross margin decreased from during to during the same period in gross margin was negatively impacted in by the reductions in sales prices of certain completed homesites  as well as the sale of a bulk parcel in texas  at cost 
variations in cost structures and the market pricing of homesites available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects  which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc  also impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting and the impact of selling homesites previously written down  will cause variations in gross margin between periods 
our communities homesite inventory consists of substantially completed homesites held for sale and land held for the development of additional homesites in the future 
as we intend to continue to sell our homesites pursuant to bluegreen communities retail sales model currently and based on the sales prices being realized on our homesites and our forecasts of sales pace  we believe that our communities inventory is being carried at the appropriate value pursuant to current accounting rules 
should our intentions or estimates relative to our communities business change in the future  the carrying values of our communities inventory and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
other communities operations historically included the operation of several daily fee golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
on december  we sold four of our golf courses located in north carolina and virginia and recognized a million non cash loss in connection with the sale 
as a result of those sales  as of december   we only own and operate only two golf courses 
the operating results of the four golf courses sold  and the loss on disposal recognized as a result of the sale  are included in discontinued operations 
other communities operations generated a pretax loss of million in compared to a pretax profit of million in the higher profit earned during reflects the one time profit of approximately million associated with the sale of our right to purchase a property in north carolina and decreased golf course green fee volume for part of  which was partially off set by lower cost of generating such revenues as we attempted to manage our golf course operating costs commensurate with the reduced level of play 
our golf course operations periodically may incur higher losses during periods of low level of play  especially during the winter months  and as a result of fixed operating expenses and high maintenance costs 
also  our two remaining golf courses are still in their early years of operations 
we believe that the operating results of these courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located build their homes and begin living in the community  as this should increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be achieved 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during throughout  we continued to reduce our overall advertising spending as we implemented a regionally based sales and marketing strategy 
in anticipation of lower sales volume  we took steps to reduce communities general and administrative expenses by reducing our staffing levels and operating fewer sales offices 
as a result  bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during as compared to we recently organized a real estate advisory services business and intend to pursue possible opportunities to use our core competencies to provide asset management  market research and other real estate consulting services to third parties on a fee basis 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so

these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  gross profit from other communities operations increased during compared to as a result of a one time profit of approximately million from the sale of our right to purchase a property in north carolina  partially off set by lower golf course green fees 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased million  or in as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of sales in reflects a lower rate of conversion of prospects to sales in and the continued shift toward more regionally focused internet based marketing  which generally have higher upfront costs 
higher advertising expenses were partially off set by lower commission expenses commensurate with the decline in sales 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased million or in as compared to as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in  reflecting the overall decrease in sales 
the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses during reflects the operation of fewer sales offices in and  to a lesser extent  our efforts to reduce costs due to the decline in sales 
finance operations our finance operations include the ongoing excess interest spread earned on over million of on balance sheet notes receivable  as well as continued earnings on over million of off balance sheet notes receivable  realized through our retained interests in those notes 
in addition  finance operations include providing mortgage servicing for the off balance sheet notes receivable and for other third parties all on a cash fee for service basis 
interest income 
the following table details the sources of our interest income in thousands year ended december  voi notes receivable retained interest in notes receivable sold other total the increase in interest income on notes receivable during as compared to reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates charged on new timeshare loans 
the average balance of our notes receivable increased during as a result of our sole use of on balance sheet facilities to monetize our notes receivable since march  partially offset by higher defaults in compared to during the years ended december  and  interest income from retained interests was reduced by charges of approximately million and million  respectively  for other than temporary decreases in our retained interests in notes receivable sold 
during  the fair value of our retained interests in voi notes receivable was adversely affected by an increase in the discount rate and unfavorable changes in our estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows on our retained interests 
the higher discount rate during reflects an increase in our estimate of the yield which would be required by a potential investor in our retained interests as of december   as compared to prior periods 
the increase in interest income during  as compared to  also reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and higher interest accretion recognized on our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
notes receivable increased during due to a higher amount of financed sales  coupled with our use of on balance sheet transactions to monetize our notes receivable 
higher interest income was partially offset by the recognition of million in other than temporary decreases in our retained interest in notes receivable sold as compared to decreases of million in 
the overall decrease in the fair value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable in was a result of an increase in the discount rate and unfavorable changes to our estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows on our retained interests 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in reflects a higher average debt balance and significantly lower amounts capitalized to construction in progress compared to as we have structured transactions to monetize our notes receivable since march so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings  we have recognized and will continue to recognize higher amounts of receivable backed debt and corresponding interest expense 
based on the timing and repayment of this debt  our outstanding debt and related interest expense may materially increase 
additional interest expense from a higher debt balance in was partially offset by a decline in our average interest rate in due to the repayment of our million of senior secured notes in march and the decrease  in general  in the variable rates on certain of our debt 
the decrease in interest expense during as compared to was primarily the result of lower average interest rates on debt outstanding and the recognition of approximately million due to a reduction in accrued interest expense related to internal revenue code irc section irc section requires that certain companies accrue and pay interest on income deferred under the installment method of profit recognition 
during  we made certain operational changes that had the impact of reducing our deferred interest obligation under irc section we believe that the adoption of new accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities in january see accounting pronouncements not yet adopted will significantly increase both interest income and interest expense due to the recognition of approximately million of notes receivable and million of non recourse receivable backed debt  which are currently accounted for off balance sheet  and which we expect will be consolidated and included on balance sheet  on a prospective basis  beginning total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
interest expense capitalized to construction in progress varies based upon the amount of construction and development spending 
our effective cost of borrowing was  and for   and  respectively 
mortgage servicing operations 
our mortgage servicing operations include recording and processing payments  and performing collection of our owned notes receivable  as well as collect payments on notes receivable sold to or owned by third parties 
in addition  our mortgage servicing operations facilitate the monetization of our voi notes receivable through our various credit facilities  as well as perform monthly reporting activities for our lenders and receivable investors 
we earn a fee for servicing loans that have been sold to off balance sheet qualified special purpose entities and for providing loan services to other third party portfolio owners  on a cash fee basis 
the following is a summary of the results of our mortgage servicing operations in thousands years ended december  servicing fee income cost of mortgage servicing operations gross profit from mortgage servicing operations the average aggregate principal balance of notes receivables serviced on behalf of third parties decreased during  as our off balance sheet securitized notes receivable continue to amortize  resulting in lower servicing fee income during as compared to effective january  the adoption of new accounting standards requires consolidation of our qualified special purpose entities and as a result  the servicing fees earned on servicing the off balance sheet notes receivable will no longer be separately recognized as such but will instead be accounted for as a component of interest income see accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
corporate general and administrative expenses our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  treasury  and legal 
corporate general and administrative expenses  excluding mortgage servicing operations  were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the million  or  decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to reflects reductions in headcount at our corporate headquarters  offset in part by higher costs related to ongoing litigation and consulting fees paid to outside consultants 
the million  or  increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher health insurance cost and higher stock compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by lower litigation costs  and the receipt of million from diamond resorts as a recovery of the due diligence cost incurred by us in connection with its terminated acquisition proposal

other expense  net 
other expense  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense  net during compared to reflects approximately million incurred in connection with exploring possible alternatives for obtaining liquidity of our notes receivable partially offset by the benefit of the termination of certain of our accrued lease obligations in an amount which was approximately million lower than we previously estimated 
the increase in other expense  net during compared to consists primarily of a charge of approximately million for a loss on disposal of various fixed assets as a result of closing certain of our off site sales offices 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold four of our golf courses located in north carolina and virginia for cash proceeds of approximately million and the net loss on the sale of the golf courses of million have been recorded in discontinued operations

changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for  and in thousands year ended december  december  december  cash flows used provided by operating activities cash flows provided by investing activities cash flows provided used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities increased million from cash outflows of million during  to cash inflows of million during the increase in cash flows from operating activities during compared to was primarily a result of significantly lower inventory development spending  our successful efforts to receive larger down payments and generate a higher percentage of cash from voi sales  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the successful implementation of certain strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition  operating cash flows for benefited from million of proceeds from off balance sheet sales of note receivable with no such proceeds included in operating cash flows during to the extent we provide financing to customers who qualify  operating cash flows are expected to be negative in periods where sales and marketing expenses exceed cash collections from voi sales 
we monetize our receivables through various on balance sheet purchase facilities and hypothecation facilities  the cash flows from which are included in cash provided by financing activities 
only when we previously structured receivable finance transactions as off balance sheet sales did the associated cash proceeds increase cash from operating activities 
the decision to structure sales of our notes receivable so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings has not and will not  in and of itself  impact total cash flows  however  we expect that it has had and will have the effect of reducing cash inflows from operating activities and increasing cash inflows from financing activities as compared to periods in which the transfer of receivables was treated as a sale 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million from net cash outflows of million to outflow of million during and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during compared to was primarily a result of our decision to structure sales of our notes receivable after march so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings and higher spending on inventory development 
during  we sold million of notes receivable through off balance sheet transactions compared to million in while we did monetize million of notes receivable through on balance sheet transactions during  all of the associated cash inflow is included in cash from financing activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows provided by investing activities increased million from million during to million during the increase was the result of lower purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by lower cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold as compared to amounts received in in addition  we paid million in to acquire the real estate and operations at two resorts  the royal suites at atlantic palace in atlantic city  new jersey  and club la pension in new orleans  louisiana  each of which constituted the purchase of a business 
no such business acquisitions were made in in addition  we realized million of cash from the sale of golf courses 
cash flows from investing activities decreased million from net cash inflows of million to million for and  respectively 
this decrease was due primarily to higher expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to and by the expenditure of cash for the business acquisition noted above 
these outflows were offset by higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold as compared to amounts received in the period 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities decreased million from net cash inflows of million in to net cash outflows of million in in  we borrowed million and repaid million of debt under our various receivable backed notes payable  lines of credit and other notes payable 
this compares to borrowings of million and repayments of million under such debt instruments during in addition  net cash flows from financing activities for the period were reduced by the repayment of our million senior secured notes on march  see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of our financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities increased million from net cash inflows of million to inflows of million during and  respectively 
this increase was primarily related to an increase of approximately million in net borrowings that are collateralized by voi notes receivable 
this increase was partially offset by lower borrowings of approximately million in under our lines of credit compared to million in cash flows from financing activities were also reduced in by the repayment of our million senior secured notes on march  in addition  during the period  we received million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures and had no such proceeds during liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv cash from our finance operations  including principal and interest payments received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois and homesites and mortgage servicing fees  and v net cash generated from our sales and marketing fee based services and other resort services  including our resorts management operations  and other communities operations 
historically our business model has depended on the availability of credit in the commercial markets 
resorts sales are generally dependent upon us providing financing to our buyers 
our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of to of the purchase price in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing  and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily cash expenses and exceed the buyer s minimum required down payment 
accordingly  having financing facilities available for the hypothecation  sale  or transfer of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor in our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
historically  we have relied on our ability to sell receivables in the term securitization market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in our receivable facilities 
in addition  maintaining adequate voi inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has historically required in the incurrence of debt for the acquisition  construction and development of new resorts 
bluegreen communities has also historically incurred debt for the acquisition and development of its residential land communities 
since  there have been unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets  which have made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly in the term securitization market 
there is significantly reduced activity and transactions that have been consummated have been on dramatically more adverse terms 
as a result  financial institutions are reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables 
several lenders to the timeshare industry  including certain of our lenders  have announced that they either have or will be exiting the resort finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future 
in addition  financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt have generally been unavailable on reasonable terms  if at all 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented certain strategic initiatives with a view to better positioning our operations in light of the downturn in the commercial credit markets 
as a result of these and other initiatives  our voi sales for were materially less than our sales 
we intend to continue to monitor our results as well as the external environment in order to attempt to adjust our business to existing conditions 
the ongoing goals of our strategic initiatives are designed to conserve cash and enhance our financial position  to the extent possible by significantly reducing our resorts sales operations in an effort to match our sales pace to our liquidity and known receivable capacity  emphasizing cash based business in our sales  resort management and finance operations  with particular focus on growing our fee based service business  minimizing the cash requirements of bluegreen communities  reducing overhead and increasing efficiency  minimizing capital spending  working with our lenders to renew  extend  or refinance our credit facilities  maintaining compliance under our outstanding indebtedness  and continuing to provide what we believe to be a high level of quality vacation experiences and customer service to our voi owners 
while we believe that we have realized initial success with our strategic initiatives  there is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our goals 
while the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive  one of our principal goals is to leverage our sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  resort management  title and construction expertise to pursue low capital requirement  fee based service business relationships that produce strong cash flows for us 
we have a material amount of debt maturing or requiring partial repayment in  as well as facilities for which the advance period has or will expire 
we intend to seek to renew  extend or refinance certain of our debt issuances and credit facilities and we believe that the implementation of our strategic initiatives has positioned us to address these matters with our existing and future lenders 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to renew  extend or refinance our debt  and if we are not successful  our liquidity would be significantly adversely impacted 
further  while we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations or repay outstanding debt  there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
in light of the current trading price of our common stock  financing involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
our levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i our significant cash requirements to service debt reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as conditions in the credit markets  generally  ii our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures  credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on or repurchase common stock although we do not currently believe that any such transactions are likely to be structured so as to materially limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock  if our board were to choose to do so  or our ability to repurchase shares in the near term  although there is no assurance that this will remain true in the future  and iv our leverage position may limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
during  we worked with woodbridge holdings llc which as of december   beneficially own of our outstanding common stock to explore possible alternatives for obtaining liquidity in the sale or financing of our receivables 
in connection with those efforts  we agreed to reimburse woodbridge for certain expenses  including legal and professional fees 
during  we reimbursed or accrued approximately million for such expenses 
while we may continue to explore additional alternatives in the future  we do not believe that our previous efforts or the related expenditures are likely to result in future benefits 
accordingly  we expensed the million and this amount is reflected as other expense in our income statement 
credit facilities the following is a discussion of our material purchase and credit facilities  including those that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to a significant credit facility  and capital leases 
credit facilities for bluegreen receivables with future availability we maintain various credit facilities with financial institutions that provide receivable financing for our operations

other effective receivable capacity 
pursuant to the terms of certain of our prior term securitizations and similar type transactions  we have the ability to substitute new eligible voi notes receivable into such facilities in the event receivables that were previously sold in such transactions are defaulted or are the subject of an owner upgrade transaction  subject to certain limitations 
these substitutions result in us receiving additional cash through our monthly distribution on our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
we intend to continue to use this other effective receivable capacity  subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable facilities 
as of december   the aggregate remaining substitution capacity under all of such existing facilities would allow us to substitute approximately million of eligible voi notes receivable in the future  subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable facilities

the gmac communities facility 
we have an outstanding balance under a credit facility the gmac communities facility historically used to finance our bluegreen communities real estate acquisitions and development activities 
the gmac communities facility is secured by the real property homesites and personal property related thereto at the following bluegreen communities projects the secured projects havenwood at hunter s crossing new braunfels  texas  the bridges at preston crossings grayson county  texas  king oaks college station  texas  vintage oaks at the vineyard new braunfels  texas  and sanctuary cove at st 
andrews sound waverly  georgia 
in addition  the gmac communities facility is secured by certain of our golf courses the bridges at preston crossings grayson county  texas and sanctuary cove waverly  georgia 
the period during which we can add additional projects to the gmac communities facility has expired 
on july   we amended this credit facility extending the maturity of the facility to december  in connection with the amendment  we repaid million of the outstanding balance under the gmac communities facility at closing  and agreed to make minimum quarterly cumulative payments commencing in january with the final maturity of december  principal payments are effected through agreed upon release prices as real estate collateralizing the gmac communities facility is sold  subject to the minimum required amortization discussed above

in connection with the previously discussed sale of our golf courses at carolina national southport  north carolina  the preserve at jordan lake chapel hill  north carolina  brickshire new kent  virginia  and chapel ridge pittsboro  nc during december  we repaid million under this facility as a release payment for the sold courses which had been part of the collateral for the gmac communities facility 
during  we repaid a total of million under this facility 
the wachovia notes payable 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt to wachovia bank  na wachovia under various notes payable collateralized by certain of our timeshare resorts or sales offices the wachovia notes payable 
we extended the maturity of a million note payable collateralized by our williamsburg resort to april  we have a non binding term sheet with wachovia to refinance the wachovia notes payable  extending the maturity to months after the closing of the extension 
the term sheet also includes the wachovia line of credit see section below unsecured credit facility wachovia line of credit which had a balance of million as of december  the term sheet and subsequent discussions required that we make release principal payments as the vois which will collateralize the extended loan are sold  subject to a minimum monthly amortization 
the extended loan would consolidate the wachovia notes payable and the wachovia line of credit into one term loan which bears interest at the month libor 
the term sheet contemplates us providing additional collateral for this facility and amending covenants  other terms and conditions 
there is no assurances that the transactions contemplated by the term sheet will occur on these terms  if at all 
in february  we made a required principal payment of million related to one of the wachovia note payable loans 
for the year ended december   we determined that we had failed to comply with an interest coverage ratio covenant contained in the note 
in march  we received a waiver of non compliance for this covenant from wachovia 
textron ad c facility 
in april  bluegreen vacations unlimited  inc bvu  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a million  revolving master acquisition  development and construction facility loan agreement the textron ad c facility with textron financial corporation textron 
the textron ad c facility has historically been used to facilitate the borrowing of funds for resort acquisition and development activities 
we have guaranteed all sub loans under the master agreement 
interest on the textron ad c facility is equal to the prime rate plus and is due monthly 
on october   we entered into an amendment to the textron ad c facility and a sub loan under the facility used to fund the acquisition and development of our odyssey dells resort the odyssey sub loan 
the amendment to the odyssey sub loan extended the final maturity of outstanding borrowings under the odyssey sub loan to december   and revised the periodic minimum required principal amortization 
as amended  our next minimum required principal payment will be approximately million in march with additional minimum required principal payments of million per quarter thereafter through maturity 
we will continue to pay textron principal payments as we sell each timeshare interests that collateralize the odyssey sub loan  and these payments will count towards the minimum required principal payments 
as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the sub loan totaled approximately million 
the textron ad c facility originally had a facility limit of million which represented the maximum amount of credit that textron would extend for resort acquisition and development activities  subject to textron s further approval of sub loans for specific projects 
as of september   the remaining available credit under the textron facility was approximately million 
we had previously substantially completed our development activities on existing projects under the textron ad c facility and bvu had no plans to acquire additional projects prior to the expiration of the textron ad c facility s project approval period in april therefore  in exchange for the extended maturities on the odyssey sub loan  we agreed to amend the textron facility to terminate our remaining availability 
the maturity date of the other outstanding sub loan under the textron ad c facility  subject to minimum required amortization during the periods prior to maturity  is april our outstanding balance on the sub loan used to acquire our atlantic palace resort in atlantic city  new jersey was million as of december  unsecured credit facility wachovia line of credit we currently have an unsecured line of credit with wachovia 
amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at day libor plus at december  
interest is due monthly 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
the current maturity of this line of credit is april   however we have received a non binding term sheet from wachovia to extend the maturity for an additional months from the closing of the extension  subject to required monthly amortization 
as contemplated in the term sheet  the extended loan would consolidate the wachovia notes payable and the wachovia line of credit into one term loan  which would bear interest at the month libor 
the term sheet contemplates us providing additional collateral for this facility and amending covenants  other terms and conditions 
there can be no assurances that such refinancing will be obtained on the terms contemplated in the term sheet  if at all 
during  we borrowed million under this line of credit for general corporate purposes 
there is no further availability under the wachovia line of credit 
in march  we made a required payment of million relating to the wachovia line of credit 
commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our bluegreen resorts and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following tables summarize the contractual minimum principal and interest payments  respectively  required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases by period date  as of december   which excludes the extension contemplated by the wachovia loan term sheet previously discussed in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures noncancelable operating leases total contractual obligations interest obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures total contractual interest total contractual obligations assumes that the interest rate on variable rate debt remains the same as the rate at december  should the extension contemplated in the wachovia term sheet close  our contractual obligations less than one year are expected to decrease by million 
we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale pledge of voi notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the principal payments required on contractual obligations 
while this may not prove to be the case  we believe that we will continue to be successful in renewing certain debt facilities and or obtaining extensions 
based on this and the expected positive impact on our financial position of the strategic initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of  we believe that we will be in a position to meet required debt payments when we expect them to be ultimately due  however there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we estimate that the cash required to complete resort buildings  resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred was approximately million as of december  we estimate that the cash required to complete communities in which sales have occurred was approximately million 
these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made in a sales contract with a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next three to ten years  primarily with cash generated from operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing commitments or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we intend to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  subject to the successful implementation of ongoing strategic initiatives and debt maturity extensions discussed above and the availability of credit 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  and transactions with affiliates  as well as covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants  that we will be successful in obtaining waivers  or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
further  although we do not currently believe that any such transactions are likely to be structured so as to materially limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock or our ability repurchase shares in the near term  there is  although  no assurance this will remain true in the future 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements we historically chose to monetize our receivables through various facilities and through periodic term securitization transactions  as these arrangements provided us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have historically generated gains on our income statement on a periodic basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
as previously discussed  we made the decision to structure future sales of our notes receivable so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
recently  the term securitization market has had minimal activity and there is no assurance that these types of transactions will be available in the future at acceptable cost  if at all 
historically  we have been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity retained residual interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable transaction documents  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interest in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  make interest and principal payments to investors  fund required reserves  if any  and pay distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables  pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents 
however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds are paid to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the utilization of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent of any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization type facility  certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee

r which has subsequently been renamed asc  which became effective for us on january  asc addresses the effects of eliminating the qualified special purpose entity qspe concept and responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of previous accounting rules  including concerns over the transparency of an enterprises involvement with variable interest entities vies 
as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement on january   we expect that we will be required to consolidate our qspes described in note to our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk during  our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars represented approximately of our consolidated revenues and our consolidated assets 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we sold million and million of fixed rate voi notes receivable off balance sheet during and  respectively  and none in under various vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities and term securitization transactions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our gains on sale recognized are generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to  the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the hypothetical change in fair value or our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on adverse changes in assumptions including discount rate 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
if interest rates increased or decreased one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be approximately million 
a similar change in interest rates would affect the total fair value of our fixed rate debt by an immaterial amount 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could result due to interest rate changes 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
