overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  lowndes  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have four full service banking facilities  a loan production office  and six automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market either through de novo branching or acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
we believe that investing in sales and marketing in this challenging market will provide us with a competitive advantage 
to that end  we have continued with our plans to expand geographically with a new full service banking center in valdosta  georgia 
we have leadership in place and have begun to add additional staff 
the branch is scheduled to open during the second quarter of the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  after reaching a high of  in  the federal reserve bank decreased the overnight borrowing rate for banks by to a range of to in september the historically low level remained throughout our profitability is impacted also by operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  occupancy  and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which are outside of our control 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  and trust and retail brokerage services 
as a result of broadening our revenue sources  in  noninterest income was more than of the corporation s total revenue  whereas in noninterest income only accounted for of the corporation s total revenue 
the financial markets and economic conditions generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all commercial and residential mortgages as property prices declined rapidly and to nearly all asset classes 
the effect of the market and economic downturn also spread to other areas of the credit markets and impacted the availability of liquidity 
the magnitude of these declines led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions 
during this period  interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply  precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers 
unemployment also increased significantly 
the corporation was not immune to these adverse economic conditions  as non performing assets increased to million at the end of the increase was due to funding the remaining construction costs of a loan carried in other real estate and a million loan that was placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter of these two relationships accounted for ninety three percent of all non performing assets 
settlement is expected to occur late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of on the large nonaccrual loan 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million  an increase of approximately million when compared with a net loss of million in this increase in net income is largely attributable to lower salary and employee benefits of thousand and higher net interest income resulting primarily from lower interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was partially offset by a loan loss provision of thousand in net income in was impacted by a million non cash loss related to the impairment of equity securities  a thousand loss at the corporation s mortgage banking subsidiary and a fourth quarter charge off of thousand and related loan loss provision of thousand 
on a per share basis  we had a net income of per diluted share for compared with a net loss of per diluted share for net loss for was million  a decrease of approximately million when compared with net income of million in the decrease in annual net income in was largely attributable to a million non cash loss on the impairment of equity securities and a million loss at our mortgage banking subsidiary recognized during the third quarter of the non cash loss on the impairment of equity securities was due to the devaluation of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock that we held in our security portfolio 
these securities lost value as a result of the us government s actions to place these government sponsored enterprises in conservatorship  and mark to market accounting rules require such a non cash impairment loss to be reported through income 
the loss related to the mortgage banking subsidiary was realized as a result of covering other shortfalls of participant banks from a sale of foreclosed commercial property 
also  negatively impacting net income was a provision for loan losses of thousand taken during the fourth quarter of this provision resulted from a thousand partial charge off related to a large commercial real estate loan 
these decreases in net income were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of thousand mainly attributed to lower interest expense on deposits 
on a per share basis  we had a net loss in of per diluted share compared with net income of per diluted share for we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table caption

net interest income net interest income after the provision for loan losses increased thousand  or  to million for as compared with reduced interest paid on deposits and borrowings of million and thousand  respectively  due to a lower interest rate environment more than offset the million decline in total interest income 
the corporation recognized a thousand provision for loan losses in  compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand in the average rate paid on average time deposits of million decreased basis points compared with interest income from investment securities decreased by million due to a lower average volume of securities of million  and interest on deposits in other banks also decreased by thousand 
interest and fees on loans increased by thousand to million 
net interest income after the provision for loan losses for decreased thousand  or  when compared with the benefit of reduced costs of funds was more than offset by the thousand provision for loan loss which was necessary due to the charge offs experienced in the fourth quarter of excluding the provision for loan loss  net interest income would have increased by thousand 
another factor contributing to the decline in net interest income was the decrease in interest and fees on loans of thousand 
interest and fees on loans were impacted by a drop in the prime rate since september  which reduced interest earned on variable and adjustable rate loans 
in addition  the bank holds one large loan that was placed on interest nonaccrual status in late the decrease in interest on securities was mainly due to the million drop in the average volume of investments 
these decreases in interest income in were offset by million in lower interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the bulk of this decrease was in interest on deposits due to a declining interest rate environment 
the average rate paid on average time deposits of million decreased basis points compared with net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin improved to for  a basis point increase from net interest margin was for  a basis point increase from in this improvement in margin was impacted by the lower interest rate environment on interest bearing deposits along with the volume growth in loans 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important contributor to net earnings

nm not meaningful for  noninterest income was million compared with million for excluding last year s loss on the impairment of equity securities of million  year to date noninterest income was down thousand when compared with the same period last year 
the decline primarily resulted from a drop in mortgage banking services revenue of thousand  or 
other contributing factors included income from trust services and retail brokerage services which decreased thousand and thousand  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit account of thousand and the thousand gain on the sale of securities in for  total noninterest income was million compared with million for the majority of the decline was a result of the million non cash loss on the impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock recognized in the third quarter of the securities lost value as a result of the us government s actions to place these government sponsored enterprises in conservatorship 
in addition  mortgage banking services income decreased thousand  or  in  as the credit crisis has made the mortgage funding environment challenging and has restricted loan opportunities 
revenue from service charges on deposit accounts decreased thousand  and income from insurance services and trust services decreased thousand and thousand  respectively  when compared with the same period last year 
noninterest expense noninterest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense

del salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense equipment expense data processing expense amortization of intangible assets losses related to mortgage banking services  other operating expenses    total noninterest expense    del 
total noninterest expense decreased million to million in compared with the same period of the prior year  primarily due to a mortgage banking services loss of thousand that was recognized in salary and employee benefits declined thousand in occupancy and equipment expense decreased by thousand and thousand  respectively 
offsetting these decreases were other operating expenses which were higher due to increased legal and fdic insurance fees of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the increased legal fees resulted from the mortgage banking service s associated insurance claim 
the fdic increased the quarterly assessments by thousand  plus a special assessment of thousand 
total noninterest expense decreased thousand to million in compared with the same period of the prior year 
the major cause of the decrease in noninterest expense was a reduction in losses related to mortgage banking services of thousand in the decline of amortization of intangible assets of thousand reflects the full amortization of the mortgage banking intangibles in these decreases were partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to the settlement of a compensation agreement and the staffing of our new loan production office in valdosta  georgia 
other operating expenses were up due to higher legal fees as they related to mortgage banking services as well as incremental operating expenses related to the new valdosta loan production office 
the efficiency ratio noninterest expense divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  decreased to for  from for and for the higher efficiency ratio in was primarily due to the loss related to mortgage banking services and lower revenue as a result of the non cash impairment loss recognized on equity securities 
excluding these items  the adjusted efficiency ratio for would have been lower at compared with 
federal income tax expense the corporation had an expense of thousand for federal income taxes in compared with a benefit of million and an expense of thousand for the years ending december   and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in an effective tax rate of   and  for   and  respectively

uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets increased million  or  to million  as compared with the increase in total average assets is primarily attributable to valdosta s full service branch construction and increase in foreclosed assets 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits with banks  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a slight decrease from million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased average volume in investment securities however  the earning asset mix shifted towards higher average loans 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold and balances with banks 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets decreased slightly to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and uses of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

total loans increased million while average total loans increased million in compared with the increase in loan demand was primarily due to installment and commercial real estate loans 
of the million increase in loans  million originated in the valdosta  georgia market where we opened a loan production office in the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end decreased to in compared with in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of loans secured by construction real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate  of loans secured by residential real estate  and of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes of and installment loans to individuals for consumer purposes of 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a thousand increase from the corresponding year end amount which was also of total loans outstanding 
we determined to increase the allowance for loan losses in response to the market and economic environment 
there was a provision for loan losses of thousand in compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand in the higher provision was primarily related to a partial charge off of a large commercial real estate loan in the fourth quarter of see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist largely of us government sponsored pass thru mortgage backed securities and us government agency bonds 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with significant cash flow for reinvestment

the total investment portfolio decreased to million from million at year end compared with year end  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to maturities and calls of approximately million of us government agency and tax free municipal securities 
also  the portfolio experienced million in sales of longer term residential mortgage backed securities  corporate notes and preferred stock for a gain of thousand 
the residential mortgage backed securities principal paydowns were approximately million 
the bank reinvested million of these funds mainly in short term government sponsored residential mortgage backed securities 
other purchases were of state and municipal securities 
the average total investment portfolio decreased million to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  renegotiated loans  potential problem loans and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets increased million at year end compared with year end this increase was primarily due to one large foreclosed commercial property as well as another large loan placed on interest nonaccrual in the third quarter of that is awaiting settlement 
the large foreclosed property was and remains under construction and the costs of improvements are now fully funded 
nonperforming assets were approximately million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits increased compared with  from million to million 
this average deposit growth occurred primarily in time deposits and noninterest bearing deposits 
also  many of our now accounts with low transaction volume were reclassified during and to money market accounts which resulted in a change in the deposit mix 
the reclassification is an accounting transaction and does not impact customer account balances or their fdic coverage 
as a result of the low rate environment  balances in our commercial customers money market accounts were reduced by the end of the year 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
this was a increase from the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation borrowed million from the federal home loan bank and repaid million of short term advances 
during  million of advances is expected to be repaid 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  details on the federal home bank advances are presented in note to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash flows of million  while investing activities used million resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments that are easily converted into cash without significant loss 
the corporation had no investment securities maturing within one year or less on december  however  the corporation has million of state and municipal securities callable at the option of the issuer and approximately million of annual cash flow in principal reductions from payments of mortgage backed securities 
due to the drop in the short term rate by the federal reserve since september  million of our callable securities were called in and million were called in we have reinvested these proceeds from called investment securities in new loans  new investment securities  and for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a non cash loss on the impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock of million 
we are not aware of any other known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations are long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations are comprised of telephone operating leases  purchase obligations for data processing services  and a rental agreement for our loan production office in valdosta  georgia

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted  the corporation and the bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels

interest rate sensitivity the corporation s most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of its sensitivity and exposure to interest rate movements which is the corporation s primary market risk 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that receives monthly cash flows from mortgage backed securities principal payments  and staggered maturities which provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity
