results of operations overview our primary business objective is to generate income while preserving principal by investing in real estate loans 
we believe there is a significant market opportunity to make real estate loans to owners and developers of real property whose financing needs are not met by other real estate lenders 
the loan underwriting standards utilized by our manager and vestin originations are less strict than those used by many institutional real estate lenders 
in addition  one of our competitive advantages is our ability to approve loan applications more quickly than many institutional lenders 
as a result  in certain cases  we may make real estate loans that are riskier than real estate loans made by many institutional lenders such as commercial banks 
however  in return  we seek a higher interest rate and our manager takes steps to mitigate the lending risks such as imposing a lower loan to value ratio 
while we may assume more risk than many institutional real estate lenders  in return  we seek to generate higher yields from our real estate loans 
our operating results are affected primarily by i the amount of capital we have to invest in real estate loans  ii the level of real estate lending activity in the markets we service  iii our ability to identify and work with suitable borrowers  iv the interest rates we are able to charge on our loans and v the level of non performing assets  foreclosures and related loan losses which we may experience 
our recent operating results have been adversely affected by increases in allowances for loan losses and increases in non performing assets 
this negative trend accelerated sharply during the year ended december  and continues to affect our operations 
as of december   we had nine loans considered non performing ie  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when the payment of interest is days past due 
these loans are currently carried on our books at a value of approximately million  net of allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
these loans have been placed on non accrual of interest status and may be the subject of pending foreclosure proceedings 

table of contents non performing assets  net of allowance for loan losses  totaled approximately million or of our total assets as of december   as compared to approximately million or of our total assets as of december  at december   non performing assets consisted of approximately million of real estate held for sale and approximately million of non performing loans  net of allowance for loan losses 
one of the real estate held for sale properties generated net income from rentals totaling  during the year ended december  none of the other properties held for sale generated net income during such time period
