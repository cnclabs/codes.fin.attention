overview strategy performance against key operational metrics during  staar focused on the following key operational metrics to improve cash flow from operations  to increase gross profit margin  to continue cost reduction efforts  to secure key regulatory approvals  to increase the icl s share of the refractive market in key territories 
achievement against these goals is discussed below 
improve cash flow from operations 
for several years prior to staar had not generated enough cash to sustain its operations 
staar has steadily reduced its use of cash significantly in recent quarters primarily through cost reductions  and in the second quarter of generated  in cash from operations  its first positive cash flow from operations after six consecutive negative years 
in the fourth quarter of staar generated  in cash from operating activities  compared to  used for operating activities in the fourth quarter of during fiscal year staar generated million in cash from operating activities  compared to million in cash used for operating activities in improving cash flow and achieving profitability remain key goals of staar during the sale of domilens in the first quarter of will present a challenge in meeting these goals  because domilens has historically been profitable and generated cash for staar 
staar s objectives for earnings growth and continued positive cash flow  and risks related to their achievement  are discussed in detail below under operational goals 
staar exited with cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of million  compared with million at january  staar s cash position was enhanced by the million net cash proceeds of a registered direct offering of common stock completed on june  staar also received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of domilens in the first quarter of the adequacy of cash we expect to generate from operations in  along with the recently obtained capital  to satisfy staar s needs is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year and staar s cash flow has been significantly affected by the cost of defending the parallax and moody lawsuits 
both lawsuits were settled on march  as a result  staar expects its legal costs to be approximately million lower in than in increase gross profit margins 
in recent quarters staar has generally experienced increased sales in icl and iol sales 
while growth in sales remains an important goal  staar believes that the key to achieving sustainable profitability is to increase its gross profit margins 
despite a number of initiatives to improve gross profit margins  staar s gross profit margin for was  up basis points only because gross profit margins of were negatively impacted by million in purchase accounting charges recorded in the first quarter of related to the acquisition of staar japan 
several initiatives of staar helped gross profit margins in  in particular increased worldwide sales of icls and ticls  increased average selling prices of iols in the us  and de emphasis on selling non lens products 
however  a number of unexpected challenges offset these improvements reduced manufacturing yields  decreased average selling prices of iols and icls outside the us  and increased cost of goods in germany  primarily as a result of changes in exchange rates 
decreased average selling prices for iols primarily resulted from unusually strong price competition in japan 
decreased average selling prices for icls and ticls primarily resulted from a pricing concession we made to our korean distributor to enable the distributor to invest in intensified marketing efforts 
we believe we have addressed most of the issues negatively impacting gross profit margins and that those efforts resulted in higher gross profit margins in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of the march  sale of domilens gmbh is expected to significantly improve staar s gross profit margins 
this and other initiatives to improve gross profit margin in are discussed below under operational goals 
continue cost reduction efforts 
achieving greater operating and administrative efficiency through reduced costs has been a key goal of staar  and is a significant element in achieving our goal of profitability 
in particular  while staar s international operations have generally generated cash or have been cash flow neutral in recent quarters  losses from us operations have been the principal cause of cash use and losses on a consolidated basis 
during staar continued cost reduction initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of  yielding a combined reduction in marketing and selling and research and development expenses of million in compared to this included the following a reduction in marketing and selling expense year over year  from million to million  principally as a result of decrease salaries  travel  consulting  promotional activities and commissions in the u 
s  and a reduction r d expenses year over year  from million to million  principally as a result of decreased salaries  reduced consulting fees and general cost containment 
staar believes that the global settlement of the parallax and moody litigation on march  will eliminate much of the litigation defense expense that staar experienced in and result in much lower legal expenses in compared to prior to the settlement  the availability of reimbursement for our legal fees from our insurance carrier  along with the transition of the lawsuits from trial to appeal  had already begun to reduce legal defense expense 
on october   staar s general liability insurer agreed to pay a portion of the legal fees incurred by staar after july  for its defense of the moody case 
on october  the insurer agreed to pay a portion of the legal fees incurred by staar after july  for the appeal in the parallax case 
staar received  in reimbursement payments related to the moody case in  and through the date of this report has received  in in connection with the global settlement of the parallax and moody cases staar will voluntarily dismiss its appeals  and except for minor post settlement matters legal expenditures related to the cases will cease 
secure key regulatory approvals 
regulatory approvals of high gross profit margin products in significant markets can yield rapid growth in sales and improvements in profitability 
during the most significant approvals sought by staar were for sale of the visian icl and ticl in japan and the ticl in the us as a result of progress made during  japan s ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw approved the sale of the icl on february    making it the first phakic iol approved for the japanese market 
staar intends to file a partial change application for approval of the visian toric icl  and is currently in discussions with the pharmaceuticals and medical device agency pmda regarding that process 
mhlw generally requires up to one year to fully process a partial change application  although that timeline can change based on the nature of the product under review 
following a two year process in which staar addressed a number of agency concerns  on july   the us food and drug administration fda notified staar that as a result of staar s corrective actions the fda had removed an integrity hold on our application for approval of the ticl  and would resume its consideration of the application 
substantive discussions with the fda regarding the application resumed at that time 
on february  staar received a letter of deficiency from the fda requesting additional analysis of data supporting the safety and effectiveness of the ticl and requesting changes in proposed labeling for the product 
staar is preparing a comprehensive response to the items in this letter 
increase the icl s share of the refractive market in key territories 
after introducing the icl in international markets in staar has secured approval for sale in over countries 
while sales have increased as new territories were added  we have achieved significant sales and increased share of the refractive surgical market in a select number of territories in particular  the us  korea  china  india  spain  germany  and latin america 
in order to increase icl sales most effectively  in staar adopted a strategy of focusing on increasing the icl s share of the refractive market in those territories 
based on growth in staar s sales in those countries  and statistics indicating a general decline in the overall refractive market  staar believes it succeeded in increasing market share in each of those territories in the most significant growth took place in the korean market  where sales reported by staar s independent distributor indicate that the visian products exceeded a share of the overall refractive market 
along with its new opportunity in japan  staar intends to continue to focus its visian icl marketing efforts on this group of key markets in key operational metrics for during  staar is focused on the following key operational metrics which are designed to enable the company to pursue new growth strategies double digit growth in sales from core icl and iol products  improvement in gross profit margins to the mid level for the year  progress toward profitability throughout the year  with a goal of achieving net income for the full year  continued generation of cash  improve financial condition by retiring obligations and strengthening the balance sheet 
double digit growth in sales from core icl and iol products 
to continue generating cash from operations and reach profitability  staar must significantly improve sales derived from its higher value products 
the sale of domilens  which has significantly reduced the portion of staar s sales derived from lower gross profit margin sales such as third party products  disposables and surgical kits  provides an opportunity for staar to focus on its core icl and iol products 
staar achieved approximately growth in worldwide icl sales during  and believes similar growth is achievable in  especially with expansion into the japanese market following the february  approval of the icl 
however  the rate of growth in visian icl sales will partly depend on continued improvement in worldwide economic conditions 
icl surgery is a relatively expensive elective procedure and is seldom reimbursed by insurers or government agencies 
staar believes that that global recession has reduced overall demand for refractive surgery 
staar will continue to focus its icl marketing efforts in the key territories where it has established significant market share  based on the success of this strategy in japan will be added to the list in  like other asian countries  japan has a high mean rate of myopia  which makes it a promising new market 
the key territories in which staar will seek to enhance visian sales during are the us  japan  korea  china  india  spain  germany  uk  and france 
staar believes that the singular success of visian products in korea  where staar believes it has exceed a penetration rate among all refractive surgical procedures  may provide a model of best practices to increase market share in other key territories 
us military forces currently represent the largest single customer for icls in the us military purchases of icls accounted for most of staar s growth in us icl sales over staar does not believe that private sector purchases of icls will resume growing significantly until consumer confidence improves  which depends on continued recovery in the us economy 
during staar s international iol sales increased by and us iol sales decreased by 
challenges faced by staar in selling iols in included stronger than usual price competition in japan  where average iol selling prices are typically higher than in other countries 
to maintain gross profit margins of staar japan  staar has chosen not to the match deep discounts offered by some competitors  which may limit opportunities to increase preloaded injector sales in japan until economic conditions improve 
staar has seen its us iol sales volume decline steadily for the last several years 
however  the rate of decline has recently decreased and staar s introduction of aspheric iols with ntiol status in and has resulted in higher average selling price for staar s iols in the us  further reducing erosion in sales 
staar introduced three new products in the us in to drive growth in its iol market  the nanoflex iol  the nanopoint injection system  and the advanced epiphany injector for staar s three piece collamer aspheric lens 
these products did not have a significant impact on sales within due to timing of introduction  but staar believes they will have greater impact in  especially the nanoflex iol 
staar believes its recent product introductions have given the company a very competitive iol product line with unique features and benefits  and offer an opportunity to regain lost iol market share 
staar intends to support these products with sales and marketing growth based initiatives in staar also expects to obtain fda approval to sell its silicone preloaded injectors in the us during staar believes this product will further enhance its us iol offering  and will help staar maintain or increase its market share in the silicone iol segment 
improvement in gross profit margins to the mid level for the year 
as noted above  staar did not make the progress it had planned towards increasing gross profit margin in however  in staar had significantly improved gross profit margin from in to in  and staar believes it has an opportunity to again increase gross profit margins significantly in an important factor in this expected improvement is the march  sale of domilens  which will remove some of the lowest gross profit margin sales from staar s product mix third party products  supplies and disposables like surgical drapes  and assembly of custom surgical kits 
staar will seek to further increase gross profit margin through the following increasing icl sales as a percentage of staar s overall product mix 
visian icls and ticls generally yield an gross profit margin 
the visian product line is staar s most profitable product family and the largest contributor to enhanced gross profit margins 
during we expect the launch of icl sales in japan  and expanding market share in existing markets  to improve staar s profitability 
the sale of domilens  whose products were overwhelmingly in the cataract area and included many non lens products  has significantly increased the portion of our sales derived from the visian product line 
reducing cost of preloaded injectors 
in japan iols enjoy higher average selling prices than in most countries  and as a result the japan iol business can yield significant gross profit margins and contribute significantly to staar s improvement in gross profit margins 
however  price competition has recently increased in the japan iol market  indicating that staar must reduce the cost of producing preloaded injectors to sustain or improve iol gross profit margins in japan 
staar believes opportunities exist to further reduce manufacturing costs for its products sold in japan  which could better enable staar to maintain profits in the face of such competition 
increase sales of higher value iols in the us in and staar began converting its us iol product offering from lower value legacy products to newer aspheric designs that are eligible for enhanced cms reimbursement as ntiols 
with the introduction of the nanoflex iol in  staar has introduced aspheric versions for both of its iol product platforms 
as staar s customers switch to aspheric lenses  and staar sells down its inventories of non aspheric lenses  us iol gross profit margins have increased 
this process will continue in in addition  early results of marketing efforts for the nanoflex lens suggest that this product may attract new customers to staar iols and rebuild us iol market share  further enhancing gross profit margins 
continue to implement centers of excellence program 
staar believes that it has an opportunity to reduce costs while continuing its history of innovation by rationalizing its business among its worldwide operations through its centers of excellence program 
during staar moved the production of silicone iols for use in preloaded injectors from japan to the us  centralizing all silicone lens production in the us  thereby reducing staar s overall iol costs 
during staar intends to complete the transfer of iol and icl injector system manufacturing and r d from the us to japan  which is expected to lead to cost savings and a greater focus on staar japan s more advanced lens injector designs 
staar also intends to take further efforts to improve silicone manufacturing efficiency in the us  based in part on the efficiencies of scale made possible by centralized manufacturing 
progress toward profitability throughout the year  with a goal of achieving net income for the full year 
staar has reported net losses in each period since having achieved positive cash flow from operations in  staar is now focused on the goal of delivering net income for fiscal year achieving this goal will require further reductions in staar s expenses and success in the initiatives to improve profitability contained in our other objectives 
continued generation of cash flow from operations 
staar achieved positive cash flow from operations in  and intends to continue its initiatives to improve cash flow in to be successful  cash previously generated by domilens  which accounted for million of staar s cash from operations in  will need to be replaced with increased cash from staar s remaining operations  although it is anticipated that reduced legal fees should offset a significant portion of the lost cash flow from domilens 
staar has been especially challenged to meet its cash flow goals in the first quarter 
the first quarter of each fiscal year tends to have the lowest cash flow of the year because of accounting fees related to the annual audit of our financial statements  professional fees for our consultant on internal controls pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  and holiday closures of facilities during december that reduce the processing and payment of invoices by staar during the last weeks of the fourth quarter  resulting in a significant increase in cash payments by staar as it catches up during the first month of the first quarter 
improve financial condition by retiring obligations and strengthening the balance sheet 
although the million in cash raised from the sale of domilens significantly improved the cash position of the company  as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  some of the cash may be needed to meet current financial obligations in as follows repayment of the million principal balance on the broadwood note due on december   the right of the holders of million shares of our series a convertible preferred stock to redeem them at per share or million in aggregate beginning on december  staar s goal is resolve all of its major obligations with existing capital reserves and cash generated from operations 
it also seeks to reserve any future capital raising efforts for initiatives to expand its business  rather than meeting existing obligations 
nevertheless  depending on staar s cash position during the remainder of  it may find it necessary to seek additional financing 
see financing strategy below 
other highlights divestiture of domilens 
on march  we completed the divestiture of all of our interest in our former german distribution subsidiary  domilens gmbh through a management buyout led by funds managed by hamburg based small cap buyout specialist bpe unternehmensbeteiligungen gmbh bpe 
staar s financial advisor in the transaction was berenberg bank  a german investment bank headquartered in hamburg 
the decision to divest domilens resulted primarily from a need to raise working capital 
staar originally purchased domilens in a series of stock purchases from the founder of the business between and staar originally intended to use domilens as a channel for increased sales in the german market 
however  by sales of staar product accounted for only approximately of domilens sales 
the majority of domilens sales have been third party products  including iols of other manufacturers  disposables and other supplies such as surgical drapes  and the assembly of custom surgical kits containing a package of mostly third party products needed for a single procedure 
while profitable  this business operates at gross profit margins that are significantly lower than staar s overall average 
a distribution agreement between staar and domilens provides that domilens will continue to purchase staar products at the unit sales volume previously projected for through because of the nature of the domilens business and the promise of continued distribution in germany and austria at projected levels  staar determined that the sale of domilens would not impede its core business  and would permit management to focus on higher value core business of developing  manufacturing and selling its own advanced ophthalmic products 
staar also determined that the gross purchase price for domilens  at approximately times domilens earnings before income taxes  represented a reasonable value for its investment in domilens  and that these funds were of greater use to staar as working capital 
the stock purchase agreement provides for a purchase price of  approximately million at currently prevailing exchange rates 
after adjusting for  in cash dividends received by staar from domilens in december and january  and the exclusion of expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  at closing on march  domilens akquisitions paid a cash net purchase price of  approximately million at currently prevailing exchange rates 
 of the net purchase price was paid into an escrow account  to be held against payment of any unaccrued taxes assessed for periods prior to december  funds remaining after the resolution of such potential liabilities  if any  will be distributed to staar from the escrow account  no later than december  after expenses of   related to investment banking fees  and excluding the escrowed funds and any earn out payments  staar received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the transaction approximately million at the closing date foreign exchange rate 
the company will pay a  marketing allowance in for domilens to market staar s products post the transaction 
taxes related to the disposition of domilens were estimated to be insignificant 
based on the performance of domilens in fiscal years  and  staar may earn up to an additional  approximately  at currently prevailing exchange rates 
these additional earn out payments will be paid on achievement of specified earnings before income tax ebit as set forth below 
if a target is missed in any year  but in the following year domilens achieves the target and also makes up for the earlier shortfall  the payments for both years will be earned and paid 
fiscal year domilens ebit earn out payment  million  million  million the benefits expected to be achieved from the domilens divestiture include the following approximately million in net cash proceeds  greater focus on staar s core business  significantly enhanced gross profit margins  and a contractual commitment to meet projected sales levels for staar products in germany and austria through the earn out payments will be earned only if domilens significantly improves its performance over levels it has historically been able to achieve 
domilens may not be able to achieve these improvements 
the escrow account will be used to pay any additional unaccrued taxes that the german tax authorities may assess after their next tax audit  which the company cannot predict and may leave little or no funds in the escrow account remaining for distribution to the company 
us icl sales 
us icl sales 
we consider icl sales growth in the us market to be important because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived worldwide leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
the visian icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december  visian icl sales in the us grew by during compared to prior year  and grew in when compared to levels 
most of the us growth in icl sales has been in sales to the military  while most of the private sector suffered similar declines to the overall refractive market in the us despite these continuing challenges to the lasik market the visian icl has continued to grow market share 
in order to significantly increase us sales of the icl  private sector sales must also resume growth 
staar believes that the continued global recession represents the largest challenge to increased growth in us private sector icl sales 
refractive surgery is an elective procedure generally not covered by health insurance 
patients must pay for the procedure  frequently through installment financing arrangements 
staar believes that the lack of growth in private sector icl sales in the us results from the significantly lower volume of patients seeking refractive surgery in the last two years  which has reduced the number of patients to whom the icl is offered 
while icl sales have been much more resistant to the recession than laser based procedures  unless the recent economic recovery continues and consumer spending levels also recover  private sector icl sales will not grow significantly and may decline 
staar believes that its share of the us refractive market has grown during the past two years  which will position the icl for strong sales growth when conditions improve 
by contrast  the us refractive market has declined by approximately during the past two years 
the icl has continued to benefit from positive media coverage during and early for example  in february  it was widely reported that steve holcomb  who won a gold medal in winter olympics as pilot of the us four man bobsled team  had been able to continue his successful athletic career only because he had receive icls to correct his severe myopia approximately two years ago 
in addition to poor conditions in the general economy and in particular the refractive surgery market  other challenges to sustained growth in us visian icl sales include the following the us refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  which continue to be better known than the visian icl among potential refractive patients  other newly introduced surgical products will continue to compete with the visian icl for the attention of surgeons seeking to add new  high value surgical products  in particular multifocal and accommodating iols  negative publicity about complications of lasik could reduce interest in all refractive surgical procedures  and fda approval of the ticl  which staar sells in international markets for treating patients affected by both myopia and astigmatism  has been delayed 
on april   the fda ophthalmic devices panel held a public meeting to discuss issues of medical complications and customer satisfaction following refractive surgery 
while the panel also discussed phakic iols such as the visian icl  most of its discussions centered on lasik and testimony regarding customer dissatisfaction following lasik surgery 
the panel recommended enhanced patient warnings of possible complications for lasik and created a task force to study methods of better identifying those patients who are more likely to have an unsatisfactory outcome from laser vision correction 
on october   the fda announced a three phase collaborative study on the potential impact of lasik surgery on a patient s quality of life  and also issued warning letters to seventeen ambulatory surgery centers citing inadequate systems for reporting adverse events resulting from lasik 
these fda activities have been widely reported in the us while it is difficult to assess precisely the impact that the fda s increased scrutiny on lasik has had on patient attitudes or the recommendations of practicing surgeons  it is possible that reduced demand for laser eye surgery observed in and was caused in part by concerns regarding complications and potential patient dissatisfaction 
patient concerns about lasik could increase interest in the visian icl as an alternative for patients who have a greater risk of complications from lasik 
the fact that the visian icl is removable if a patient is dissatisfied with the outcome may also be appealing to some patients with new concerns about risks of refractive surgery 
however  staar believes the negative publicity concerning lasik has decreased patient interest in all refractive surgery  including visian icl 
because nearly all candidates for refractive surgery can achieve acceptable vision through the use of spectacles or contact lenses  for most patients the decision to have refractive surgery is a lifestyle choice that depends on high confidence in achieving a satisfactory outcome 
staar makes the icl available to selected surgeons only after completion of a training program that includes proctoring of selected supervised surgeries 
staar believes that this carefully guided method of product release is essential to help ensure the consistent quality of patient outcomes and the high levels of patient satisfaction needed to establish wide acceptance of the icl as a primary choice for refractive surgery 
as the us market for icls has matured  staar has placed less emphasis on increasing its overall customer base and devoting more attention to identifying and supporting those practices that show potential for significant repeat business through a professional commitment to the icl technology 
because the refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  staar faces special challenges in introducing an intraocular refractive implant 
staar has developed a number of marketing tools and practice support programs to increase the use of the icl and awareness of its advantages in refractive surgery centers throughout the us and around the world 
us iol sales 
for several years staar has experienced a decline in us market share of iols 
the rate of decline has slowed as staar has begun replacing older lens designs with higher priced ntiol lenses 
during us iol sales declined compared to rates of decline of and in factors contributing to long term decline in us iol sales include the slow pace of product improvement and enhancement during a period when we devoted most of our research and development resources to introducing the icl and to resolving the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the fda 
this long term trend was intensified in by disruption in staar s independent sales force when staar was unable to reach a new contract with regional manufacturer s representatives in the third quarter of in addition the trend was exacerbated by staar s lagging behind its competitors in the introduction of iols with advanced aspheric optics  and by the entry of alcon as a competitor in the toric iol market 
staar s strategy to achieve its gross profit margin target in its us iol business is to rationalize its product offering around its higher value products  including recently introduced products and products planned for introduction in the near future 
this has included aspheric optics across all iol platforms  approval of higher reimbursement from medicare for these lenses  improved delivery systems for collamer iols to broaden their appeal and preloaded delivery systems for silicone lenses 
successful implementation of this strategy is subject to risks  including the risk of delays in developing new products or securing regulatory approval 
staar s initiatives to enhance its iol product line have resulted in the following recent developments the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece collamer iol in april the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece silicone iol november the april introduction of the nanopoint injector  which delivers staar s single piece collamer iol  through a mm incision  the grant of new technology iol ntiol status for the aspheric three piece collamer iol in march  the grant of ntiol status for the nanoflex aspheric single piece collamer iol and the aspheric three piece silicone iol in july  the introduction of the nanoflex aspheric single piece collamer iol in the second quarter of  which brings advanced aspheric optics to the micro incision nanopoint platform  and the launch of the epiphany injector for the collamer three piece lens in the third quarter of which brings smoother and more controlled delivery to one of staar s most advanced lenses and paves the way for us introduction of the silicone preloaded injector 
the addition of aspheric optics to staar s iol designs has been a primary focus of staar s recent development efforts 
aspheric iols use advanced optical designs intended to provide a clearer image than traditional spherical lenses  especially in low light  which has led to significant market share gains for aspheric designs 
in recognition of these advantages the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms will grant ntiol status to aspheric iols that can demonstrate improved visual performance over conventional iols  allowing an extra reimbursement per lens implanted in an asc ambulatory surgical center 
this additional reimbursement expires on february  for all iols in this class 
because the majority of iol purchases in the us are implanted at ascs and reimbursed through medicare  ntiol status significantly increases staar s potential margin on qualifying lenses 
all of staar s aspheric lenses sold in the us feature a proprietary optical design patent pending that is optimized for the naturally curved surface of the retina and certain other anatomical features of the human eye  and provides outstanding image quality even if decentered 
staar intends to continue to focus on the following projects designed to make our iol product offering more competitive complete the development of the collamer toric iol to complement our pioneering silicone toric iol and better compete with the alcon acrylic toric iol 
the collamer toric iol should provide a product with advanced optic materials and rotational stability to provide superior outcomes for cataract patients with astigmatism  gain approval for a preloaded silicone iol injector system in the us in  develop a preloaded injector system for our collamer iols  initiate a formal post market clinical evaluation to support a possible submission to the fda of claims that the lens offers patients less spectacle dependence or accommodation  and initiate a clinical study of a new iol we have designed to enhance the accommodating properties of collamer 
staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays and  in some cases  approval of regulatory authorities 
staar s development efforts aim to realize the full market potential for collamer iols by continuously improving lens delivery systems and differentiating staar s silicone iol offering through the preloaded injector 
approximately one half of iols sold by staar in the us are made of silicone  which was the original material used for foldable iols 
physician preferences in the us have shifted to toward acrylic iols and silicone iols now account for approximately of the us iol market 
staar believes that its collamer lenses have outstanding optical qualities and superior biocompatibility  and should be capable of competing with any of our competitor s acrylic lens products in the advanced material sector 
in addition  increasing use of the icl  which relies on the outstanding optical properties of collamer  has also introduced the advantages of the collamer material to a growing number of surgeons 
however  growth of the collamer iol market has been limited by the difficulty of perfecting delivery systems for the soft collamer material 
although acrylic lenses do not have the same level of optical performance in the eye as collamer and often introduce glare or glistening into the visual field  the stiffness and toughness of the acrylic material makes design of delivery systems less difficult 
staar has completed a number of development projects in place intended to make collamer lenses easier to deliver and broaden customer appeal 
the nanopoint injector system  which delivers the nanoflex one piece collamer iol through a mm incision  was the first of these projects to reach market and was launched in april in addition the launch of the epiphany injector for the collamer three piece lens in the third quarter of brings smoother and more controlled delivery to one of staar s most advanced lenses 
over the past several years surgeons implanting the nanoflex iol have reported that their cataract patients have better than expected near vision 
in late  staar organized the collamer accommodating study team or cast 
the cast consists of eight prominent physicians across the us who are implanting the recently launched nanoflex iol and are checking both near and intermediate vision approximately one month post operation 
feedback from the group indicates that the near vision achieved is better than that of any conventional iol where we have comparative data 
the feedback also indicates that the intermediate vision is better than presbyopia correcting iols that have been studied and near vision approaches that of presbyopia correcting io that are already on the market 
while introduction of the nanoflex lens did not result in increased us iol sales in  staar believes that surgeon interest in the product is growing and that it represents a significant opportunity to increase staar s us iol market share 
to further pursue this opportunity  in the first quarter of staar initiated a program called the nanoflex challenge which is intended to facilitate an interested surgeon s evaluation of the visual outcomes for patients receiving nanoflex iols compared with the outcomes from any other standard iol currently used by the surgeon 
the introduction of the epiphany injector  an advanced system which makes delivery of the three piece collamer aspheric iol more reliable and predictable  has not resulted in increased sales of this advanced lens 
based on surgeon feedback  staar has developed an easier loading mechanism for this injector  which it intends to introduce in the first half of staar believes that this lens also has the potential to improve staar s market share  particularly among surgeons who prefer loop haptics to the plate haptic design of the nanoflex 
it plans concerted marketing efforts for the three piece collamer aspheric lens once the improved epiphany injector becomes available 
while the market share of silicone iols has been slowly declining overall  a significant number of surgeons continue to select silicone lenses for their patients 
among us iol sales  staar believes that its recently introduced aspheric  three piece silicone iol offers outstanding optical performance and with its recently granted ntiol status could enable staar to retain or possibly increase its market share within the silicone iol sector  especially if staar s efforts are successful in securing fda approval to make it available in a preloaded injector 
reversing the decline in us iol sales will require staar to overcome several short and long term challenges  including successfully meeting its objectives to develop new and enhanced products  organizing  training and managing a specialized cataract sales force  managing independent local sales representatives  and competing with much larger companies 
we cannot assure that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
medical device regulatory compliance  clinical oversight and ticl approval 
as discussed above under the caption business regulatory matters  staar s ability to develop  manufacture and distribute its products depends heavily on maintaining good standing with the fda and other regulatory agencies 
based  in part  on the results of the fda inspections of staar s california facilities in and and staar s nidau  switzerland facility in  staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
staar has invested significant resources in maintaining regulatory compliance and expects to continue to do so in the future 
financing strategy staar has reported losses and negative cash flows on a consolidated basis over the last several years  primarily as a result of losses in the us business 
during this period staar has raised additional funds to support operations through sales of equity and debt securities 
as cash flow improved in recent quarters  staar has sought to avoid further financings and to operate exclusively on self generated cash 
this strategy was challenged in the first quarter of  when cash reserves were drawn down to low levels  positive cash flow had not yet been achieved  and the company suffered an adverse litigation judgment in the amount of approximately million 
at the time the judgment became final  staar did not have adequate cash or cash equivalents either to satisfy the judgment or to deposit million with the court to obtain a stay of enforcement of the judgment while the appeal was pending 
on june   the company completed a registered public offering the offering with certain existing institutional investors  raising a total of million in cash by issuing million shares of company s common stock 
the proceeds were primarily applied to posting the required million deposit with the superior court of california  county of orange  while the parallax verdict is on appeal 
on june   following the receipt of proceeds from the offering  staar timely posted this deposit with the court just before the expiration of a temporary stay of enforcement that had been granted by the court 
avoiding a similar short term cash shortfall was a principal consideration in staar s divestiture of domilens on march  among the expected demands on staar s capital resources underlying this decision  the most pressing was the million verdict rendered in the moody case  and the potential need to post a million appeal bond on or before april  the domilens divestiture yielded a total of approximately million in net cash proceeds to staar 
the potential need to post an appeal bond was eliminated by the global settlement of the parallax and moody cases on march  staar s million contribution to the global settlement will be paid from the million restricted deposit that staar already had placed with the court on june  in connection with the parallax case 
as a result  staar will be able to apply the entire million in net cash proceeds from the domilens sale to working capital  along with approximately million that will be refunded to staar from the restricted deposit 
other recent financing activity includes the december  borrowing by staar of million from broadwood partners  lp  at an interest rate of per annum  primarily to fund the acquisition of staar s remaining interest in the canon staar joint venture 
on april   after preliminary judgment was entered in the parallax case  broadwood and the company entered into a temporary waiver agreement with respect to any event of default that may occur  or may be deemed to have occurred  under the broadwood note as a result of the judgment 
in consideration of the temporary waiver agreement  staar agreed to amend the original note to grant to broadwood a security interest in substantially all of staar s assets to secure staar s obligations under the original note 
to effectuate this grant of a security interest  as of april   the company and broadwood entered into an amended and restated senior secured promissory note and security agreement 
the temporary waiver agreement had provided that no such default was deemed to have occurred until june   when a temporary stay of judgment expired 
on june   following the posting of the deposit and satisfaction of conditions of the temporary waiver  broadwood and staar again amended the note by replacing the temporary waiver with a provision stating that because the company secured a stay of enforcement of judgment until the completion of the appeal by posting the required deposit with the court  any default that may have otherwise resulted from the parallax judgment is cured 
broadwood remained entitled to receive interest at the rate of per annum beginning on june   as would have been applicable in the event a default had occurred under the original terms of the note 
under the terms of the amended note  the final resolution of the parallax and moody cases results in the interest rate on the loan returning to the pre default level 
such final resolution occurred on march  the broadwood note prohibits staar and its subsidiaries from disposing of any of its assets without prior written consent of broadwood 
on february   broadwood provided written consent to the sale of all of staar s interests in domilens 
on october   staar s general liability insurer agreed to pay a portion of the legal fees incurred by staar after july  for its defense of the moody case 
on october  the insurer agreed to pay a portion of the legal fees incurred by staar after july  for the appeal in the parallax case 
the insurer s agreement to defend these cases was subject to a full reservation of its rights and defenses 
staar received  in reimbursement payments related to the moody in  and through the date of this report has received  in prior to the march  global settlement of the parallax and moody cases  the availability of reimbursement for our legal fees from our insurance carrier  along with the transition of the lawsuits from trial to appeal  began to reduce our legal defense expenses significantly 
in connection with the global settlement  staar will voluntarily dismiss its appeals  and except for minor post settlement matters legal expenditures related to the cases will cease 
staar s need for working capital  and the terms on which financing may be available  will depend in part on its degree of success in achieving and maintaining positive cash flow and earnings through the strategies described above under the caption strategy 
staar cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  if the need arises 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period

a number of factors favorably impacted gross profit margin including increased mix of icl sales  increased asps of us iols and decreased sales of low margin non lens product sales 
the impact of these positive factors was offset by negative factors that reduced gross profit margin such as manufacturing yield issues  decreased iol asps in japan and decreased icl asps in korea  and increased cost of goods in germany due to fluctuating exchange rates 
general and administrative general and administrative expense in and was million 
staar expects general and administrative expense to decrease by approximately million in due to decreased legal fees as a result of the settlement of all outstanding litigation on march  see item legal proceedings

other operating expenses recovery  net other operating expenses recovery  net of million for fiscal year include the reversal of million in accrued judgment costs resulting from the settlement of litigation in the matters involving scott c

the reversal of accrued judgment costs were largely offset by a million charge associated with certain patents that were determined to have shorter useful lives than originally estimated 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million for both fiscal years and the tax provision is primarily related to the company s current and deferred foreign taxes due to pre tax profits generated by staar surgical ag and unremitted foreign earnings due to staar s intent to repatriate all of its foreign earnings 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales for the year ended january  fiscal were million  an increase of compared with net sales for the year ended december  fiscal of million

sales of other surgical products  generally used during cataract surgery  increased 
us net sales for fiscal decreased to million compared with fiscal  due to a decrease in iol sales which was largely offset by a increase in icl sales and a increase in other product sales 
although iol sales declined for the full year  the year over year rate of decline has slowed from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of international net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of compared with fiscal international iol sales were million  up  compared with million in the significant increase in iol sales is due to the acquisition of staar japan at the beginning of  partially offset by a decrease in iol sales in international markets outside of japan 
during  international sales of icls increased to million  compared with million in fiscal and other surgical product sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal gross profit margin gross profit margin for the fiscal was compared with for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin is due to sales of preloaded iols in japan which yield higher average selling prices than in other countries  increased sales of icls  particularly in the us where prices are higher  and increased sales of ticls 
the improvement in gross profit margin was partially offset by the staar japan acquired inventory  which was recorded at fair value in accordance with purchase accounting rules 
this higher valued inventory was sold during resulting in million in additional cost of goods sold 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  representing a increase over the million reported in fiscal  entirely due to million incurred by staar japan  offset by million reduction in the rest of the company despite significant legal costs associated with the sales representative litigation 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for fiscal were million  representing a increase over the million reported in fiscal the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal was due to the million in costs associated with staar japan 
marketing and selling expenses in the us decreased million and this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in international expenses outside of japan and the us to support the increase in icl sales 
research and development research and development expenses  including regulatory and clinical expenses  for fiscal were million  representing an increase over the million reported in fiscal the increase is due to the million in costs associated with staar japan  offset by a decrease of million as a result of cost reduction measures taken in the us to improve cash flows 
other operating expenses other operating expenses for fiscal were million and consisted of the following loss on settlement of pre existing distribution arrangement in the amount of million recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of staar japan and represented the portion of the consideration paid by staar for the termination of the pre existing distribution arrangement that was deemed unfavorable to staar japan and to staar when compared to an at market arrangement as of the closing date of the acquisition  patent impairment charges in the amount of million which was recorded in connection with certain patents that were determined to have minimal fair value to the company pursuant to the annual impairment review  and jury verdict in favor of parallax medical systems  inc reached subsequent to year end in the amount of million see item legal proceedings 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million and million for fiscal and respectively 
the increase in the provision of million was primarily due to increases in the company s current foreign tax provision of million due to pre tax profits generated by staar surgical ag  offset by a decrease in the foreign deferred tax provision of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company has managed its liquidity through a series of debt and equity financing transactions and from its foreign operations  and recently  through a sale of a subsidiary 
although the company is now generating cash from operations and expects to continue to do so in  after paying expected obligations its cash resources will continue to be limited 
the company intends to continue to manage its liquidity through certain planned cost reduction initiatives and operational goals 
the following is a summary of significant cost reduction and other planned actions contemplated by the company the company has previously disclosed certain key metrics that it intends to continue to make its priority to achieve in the forthcoming year in order to remain a going concern 
first  the company must continue to generate cash from operations by continuing to drive cost reduction initiatives and vigilantly manage the company s spending 
although no assurances can be made  this can be achieved by continuing recent trends coupled with the expected savings in legal fees in compared to  despite the sale of domilens in march second  the company has to drive overall increase in sales and improvement in the gross profit margins by increasing sales of the visian icl products and higher margin iols 
in  icl sales globally increased by globally in dollars and in units compared to principally from the international markets 
in february  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approved the sale of the icl in japan 
the success of the company and management s plans necessarily depends on several factors and events directly outside of its control including an improvement of global economic conditions and continuation of our operations in the normal course of business in our international markets 
the company s plans also assume that our trade suppliers will continue to conduct business with us on terms consistent with historical practice 
the suppliers may request faster payment of invoices  new or increased deposits or other assurances 
if this were to happen  the company s need for cash would be intensified and we might be unable to make payments to our suppliers as they become due and the company may need additional financing as necessary to continue normal operations and such financing may not be available at terms acceptable to the company  if at all  which can jeopardize the operations of the company 
overview of changes in cash and cash equivalents and other working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operations was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal the cash provided by operations was mainly due to lower net loss of million in compared to for fiscal and cash used in operations was the result of increased net losses  adjusted for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  and other miscellaneous non cash items  and net decreases in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal compared to million cash provided by investing activities in and million cash used in in june  staar posted a million bond with the court pending the appeal of the parallax judgment

staar has no access to these funds and limited information as to their investment status 
the court will pay approximately interest per annum on the deposit  which will be reinvested into the deposit account by the court and is subject to the same restrictions as the principal amount 
staar has classified this restricted cash deposit and considers this deposit to be akin to a purchase of a temporary investment with the court and any activity in this account from its inception to liquidation will be included as investing cash outflows and inflows staar s consolidated statements of cash flows 
under the stipulation for settlement resolving the parallax and moody cases  staar will stipulate to the payment of million from this deposit as its contribution to the settlement 
the remaining million will be refunded to staar

days inventory on hand were days in and days in based on finished goods inventory as of january  and january  credit facilities  contractual obligations and commitments credit facilities the company has credit facilities with different lenders to support operations in the us and japan 
on december   the company borrowed million from broadwood partners  lp broadwood  a stockholder in the company  pursuant to a senior promissory note between the company and broadwood  with a scheduled maturity of december  among the events of default under the senior promissory note is any judgment against the company in excess of  that shall remain unpaid 
on april   after preliminary judgment was entered in the parallax case  broadwood and staar entered into a temporary waiver agreement with respect to any event of default that may occur  or may be deemed to have occurred  under the note as a result of the judgment 
in consideration of the temporary waiver agreement  staar agreed to amend the senior promissory note to grant to broadwood a security interest in substantially all of staar s assets to secure staar s obligations under the original senior promissory note 
to effectuate this grant of a security interest  as of april   the company and broadwood entered into an amended and restated senior secured promissory note the note and security agreement 
all other key terms of the note remained unchanged 
the temporary waiver agreement provided that if the company secured a stay of enforcement of judgment prior to june  the expiration date of a temporary stay granted by the court  no default was deemed to have occurred with respect to the judgment 
on june   following the timely posting of the deposit and satisfaction of the provisions of the temporary waiver  broadwood and staar again amended the note by replacing the temporary waiver with a provision stating that because the company secured a stay of enforcement of judgment until the completion of the appeal by posting the required deposit with the court  any default resulting from the parallax judgment is deemed to be cured 
broadwood was entitled to receive interest at the rate of per annum beginning on june   as would have been applicable in the event a default had occurred under the original terms of the note 
however  the terms of the note also provided that if the company fully satisfies the judgments and finally resolves all material litigation  which occurred on march   the interest rate shall be reduced to per annum from the date of such final resolution 
the note may be pre paid by the company at any time without penalty  with prior notice  and is not subject to covenants based on financial performance or financial condition except for insolvency

the following table represents the company s known contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years note payable interest on note payable line of credit capital lease obligations operating lease obligations pension obligations open purchase orders total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with asc s formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
the company records revenue from non consignment product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  which is typically at shipping point  except for our staar japan subsidiary  which is typically recognized when the product is received by the customer 
staar japan does not have significant deferred revenues as delivery to the customer is generally made within the same or the next date of shipment 
our products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
we maintain title and risk of loss of consigned inventory 
in accordance with asc  we recognize revenue for consignment inventory when we are informed the iol has been implanted and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate 
we ship icls only for use by surgeons who have already been certified  or for use in scheduled training surgeries 
for all sales  we are the principal in the transaction in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent as we  among other factors  bear general inventory risk  credit risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price and bear authorized sales returns inventory risk and therefore  sales are recognized gross with corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations instead of a single  net amount 
cost of sales includes cost of production  freight and distribution  royalties  and inventory provisions  net of any purchase discounts 
we present sales tax we collect from our customers on a net basis excluded from our revenues  a presentation which is prescribed as one of two methods available under asc formerly eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
we generally permit returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by our return policies  and in good condition 
we provide allowances for sales returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of  among other factors  historical returns experience and trends  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  the entry of a competitor  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
we consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
sales are reported net of estimated returns 
if the actual sales returns are higher or lower than estimated by management  additional reduction or increase in sales may occur 
we maintain provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
r and the issuance of stock options and warrants for services from non employees in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and asc s formerly financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected term of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
accounting for warrants 
we account for the issuance of company derivative equity instruments such as the warrants  in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
we agreed to use our best efforts to register and maintain registration of the common shares underlying certain warrants the warrant shares that were issued by us with debt instruments  so that the warrant holder may freely sell the warrant shares if the warrant is exercised  and we agreed that in any event we would secure effective registration within a certain time period after issuance typically up to five months from issuance 
in addition  while the relevant warrant agreement does not require cash settlement if we do not maintain continuous registration of certain warrant shares  the agreement does not specifically preclude cash settlement 
as a result asc requires us to assume that in the absence of continuous effective registration we may be required to settle some of these warrants for cash when they are exercised 
accordingly  our agreement to register and maintain registration of certain warrant shares without express terms for settlement in the absence of continuous effective registration is presumed to create a liability to settle these warrants in cash  requiring liability classification 
we have issued other warrants under another agreement that expressly provides that if we fail to satisfy registration requirements we will be obligated only to issue additional common stock as the holder s sole remedy  with no possibility of settlement in cash 
in this circumstance  we account for those warrants as equity because additional shares are the only form of settlement available to the holder 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the valuation model to estimate the fair value of those warrants 
we evaluate the balance sheet classification of the warrants during each reporting period 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of the warrant is determined by the amount of time remaining on the original six year term of the relevant warrant agreement 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting period 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrants classified as a liability from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of other income expense 
the warrants that are accounted for as equity are only valued on the issuance date and not subsequently revalued 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of january   the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet 
net increases to the valuation allowance were   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until  and if  an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if we prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
we provide estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  expiring and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if we determine that our inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and we would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value

 goodwill and intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual impairment test and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
as of january   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
on march   we completed the sale of all of our interests in domilens and included in the net assets disposed was the domilens goodwill balance of approximately million 
definite lived intangible assets 
we also have other intangible assets mainly consisting of patents and licenses  developed technologies and customer relationships  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of january  we capitalize the cost of acquiring patents and licenses 
we acquired certain customer relationships and developed technologies in the acquisition of our staar japan subsidiary which was completed on december  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  since the pattern in which the economic benefits realized cannot be reasonably determined  which are based on legal  contractual and other provisions  and range from to years for patents and licenses  years for customer relationships and to years for developed technology 
we review intangible assets for impairment in the assessment discussed above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
based on this assessment we determined that certain of our patents had shorter useful lives than had been originally estimated  and therefore  the carrying value of these patents was overstated by million 
we recorded this million charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended to adjust the net book value and have included it in other operating expenses recovery  net employee defined benefit plans 
we have maintained a passive pension plan the swiss plan covering employees of its swiss subsidiary 
the company concluded that the features of the swiss plan conform to the features of a defined benefit plan 
as a result  we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of asc transition guidance formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas nos 
  and r sfas on october  
in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in staar japan  inc  we assumed the net pension liability under staar japan s noncontributory defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all of the employees of staar japan 
staar japan adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of asc on december   the date of the acquisition 
asc requires recognition of the funded status  or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets  then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability 
we record a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of both plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  and the expected long term rate of asset return based on the market related value of assets 
the fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements pertaining to our employee defined benefit plans could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 now accounted for under asc  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted asc on december  for the measurement of the plan assets fair value and disclosures relevant to our defined benefit plans which we have made pursuant to asc redeemable  convertible preferred stock under our certificate of incorporation we had  shares of blank check preferred stock  which our board of directors is authorized to issue with such rights  preferences and privileges as the board may determine 
on october   our board approved the designation of  shares of the preferred stock as series a redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition of the interest in canon staar co  inc which was consummated on december  on december   we issued the  shares of preferred stock to the canon companies as partial consideration for their shares of canon staar co  inc at an estimated fair value of per share  or million in the aggregate 
the fair value of the preferred stock was determined on the issuance date by us with the assistance of a valuation specialist using the binomial tree option valuation model 
this model considers the preferred stock to be a derivative asset of our common stock where the preferred stockholder has options to choose certain payoffs that maximize returns and therefore maximize the value of the preferred stock 
the payoff available to the preferred stockholder is contingent on the future market value of our common stock 
therefore the model  based on certain significant management assumptions  analyzes various payoff patterns for different possible paths that might be followed by the common stock price over the life of the preferred stock until the automatic conversion on the fifth anniversary of the issuance date 
the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for our preferred stock could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
because after the third anniversary of issuance the preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holders  which is not within our control  we have presented the preferred stock in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of asc s formerly eitf abstracts  topic no 
d topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
because the preferred stock fair value recorded on the issuance date approximates the redemption price  no further significant accretion will be required by us to redemption value and no subsequent revaluation will be necessary so long as the preferred stock is still considered a temporary equity instrument 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years had adversely affected our ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which could significantly affect our operating results 
we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency or fluctuations in foreign currencies 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the past three years 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu topic generally accepted accounting principles amendments based on the statement of financial accounting standards no 
the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
asu establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles 
the company adopted asu during the quarter ended october  in october  the fasb issued an update to asc regarding revenue recognition 
this asu no 
asu  provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables in a revenue arrangement exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
asu eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  or staar s fiscal year early adoption is permitted if the company elects to adopt asu no 
concurrently 
the company does not expect the adoption of asu will be material to its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an update to asc this asu  amends the scope of the software revenue guidance in asc to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  or staar s fiscal year early adoption is permitted if the company elects to adopt asu concurrently 
the company does not expect the adoption of asu will be material to its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an update to asc this asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements requires entities to disclose separately the significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
it also requires reconciliation of activity in level fair value measurements between beginning and ending balances  such as purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis instead of a net number 
finally  it clarifies existing disclosures for levels of disaggregation  that is to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of asset and liability and to provide disclosures around the inputs used and valuation techniques to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements that fall within levels or  which also applies to defined benefit plans and related disclosures in plan assets 
this asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  fiscal year  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal year  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company believes the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an update to asc this asu  subsequent events  states that an entity that is a sec filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued however is not required to disclose that date 
asu is effective upon issuance and the company has conformed its disclosure to this asu in the accompanying financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs and does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
as of january   staar had million yen of foreign debt that bears an interest rate that is equal to at an interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately as of january  plus and thus  our interest expense would fluctuate with any change in the prime interest rate 
if the tokyo prime rate were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately  japanese yen or approximately  based on the exchange rate in effect at january  staar s million principal amount of us indebtedness under the broadwood note bears a fixed interest rate of and may be prepaid without penalty which is the maximum that can be charged under the terms of the note 
foreign currency risk 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we transact business could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies in and  respectively 
cost of goods sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses that correspond with these sales are largely denominated in the same currency  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
for the year ended january   our german subsidiary reported million euro in net sales 
a increase in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro would  as a result of a weakened dollar  result in an approximate million translation gain 
a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro would  as a result of a stronger dollar  result in an approximate million translation loss 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in local currency 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as a result  our sales benefit from a weaker dollar and are reduced by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide primarily  the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and australian dollar 
of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies in and  approximately and  respectively  were denominated in the euro and approximately and  respectively  were denominated in the japanese yen 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
fluctuations during any given reporting period result in the re measurement of our foreign currency denominated cash  receivables  and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses and are reported in total other expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded and  of foreign currency transaction losses in and  respectively 
as a result of the divestiture of our german subsidiary on march   we have significantly reduced our foreign currency risk related to the euro 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks include those set forth in item a
