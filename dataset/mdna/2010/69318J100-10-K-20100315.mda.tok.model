item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

table of contents competition the direct marketing and sale of information technology products  including personal computers and related products  is highly competitive 
we compete with other direct marketers of it products  including cdw corporation and insight enterprises  inc  who are much larger than we are 
we also compete with certain product manufacturers that sell directly to customers  such as dell inc  as well as some of our own suppliers  such as hp  lenovo  and apple  distributors that sell directly to certain customers  local and regional vars  various franchisers  office supply superstores  and national computer retailers  and companies with more extensive websites and commercial online networks 
additional competition may arise if other new methods of distribution  such as broadband electronic software distribution  emerge in the future 
we compete not only for customers  but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from product manufacturers 
several of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
these and other factors related to our competitive position are discussed more fully in the overview of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
we believe that price  product selection and availability  and service and support are the most important competitive factors in our industry 
intellectual property rights our trademarks include pc connection  govconnection  macconnection  and moredirect  and their related logos  everything overnight  the connection  raccoon character  service connection  healthconnection  pc connection express  proconnection  traxx  graphics connection  education connection  get connected  connect  and your brands  your way  next day 
we intend to use and protect these and our other marks  as we deem necessary 
we believe our trademarks have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products 
our trademarks expire at various dates beginning in and ending in we expect to renew our trademarks in perpetuity 
we do not maintain a traditional research and development group  but we work closely with computer product manufacturers and other technology developers to stay abreast of the latest developments in computer technology  with respect to the products we both sell and use 
work force as of december   we employed  persons  of whom including management and support personnel were engaged in sales related activities  were engaged in providing it services and customer service and support  were engaged in purchasing  marketing  and distribution related activities  were engaged in the operation and development of management information systems  and were engaged in administrative and finance functions 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
our employees are not represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage

risk factors statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not based on historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections and the beliefs and assumptions of management including  without limitation  our expectations with regard to the industry s rapid technological change and exposure to 
table of contents inventory obsolescence  availability and allocations of goods  reliance on vendor support and relationships  competitive risks  pricing risks  and the overall level of economic activity and the level of business investment in information technology products 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  could  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of those terms 
we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward looking statements 
such factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below 
we undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations would likely suffer 
the uncertainty in economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and reduce our operating results 
recent economic weakness and financial markets turmoil have adversely impacted economic conditions  resulting in additional recessionary pressures and further declines in consumer confidence and spending 
businesses have in turn reacted to the decline in consumer spending by reducing staffing levels and delaying or deferring corporate spending  including their it expenditures 
both our smb and large account segments  which serve small  medium  and large businesses  have experienced significant declines in revenues and increased competitive pricing pressures  which have adversely affected our operating results 
the financial markets turmoil has also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets  which has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit to our customers 
further delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse affect on demand for our products and consequently on our financial results 
in addition  customer insolvencies could impact our ability to collect receivables and negatively impact our operating results and liquidity 
it is difficult to predict how long the uncertainty in economic conditions and the financial markets will continue  the extent  if any  to which they may deteriorate  and to which our business may be adversely affected 
however  if the current conditions should worsen  we are likely to experience a further adverse impact  which may be material  on our business and our results of operations 
should our financial performance not meet expectations and our stock price trade below current levels  we may be required to record an additional significant charge to earnings for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and more frequently if potential impairment indicators arise 
we determined that the goodwill balances held by the smb and public sector segments were fully impaired as of december   and accordingly the carrying values of those segments goodwill were written off  resulting in a significant non cash charge to earnings 
although we determined the fair value of our large account segment s goodwill substantially exceeded its carrying value at our annual impairment test on january   should this segment s financial performance not meet expectations due to the economy or otherwise  we would likely adjust downward expected future operating results and cash flows 
such adjustment may result in a determination that the carrying values for goodwill and other intangibles for that segment exceed their respective fair values 
this determination may in turn require that we record an additional significant non cash charge to earnings to reduce the million aggregate carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles held by the large account operating segment  resulting in a negative effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we have experienced variability in sales  and there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitable operations 
several factors have caused our sales and results of operations to fluctuate and we expect these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include shifts in customer demand for hardware and software products  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution  or shipping  changes in our product offerings and in merchandise returns  changes in vendor distribution of products  variations in levels of competition  industry shipments of new products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  and fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping  and printing costs 
our results also may vary based on our ability to manage personnel levels in response to fluctuations in revenue 
we base personnel levels and other operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if our revenues do not meet anticipated levels in the future  we may not be able to reduce our staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to avoid significant losses from operations 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  more restrictive price protection and other terms  and reduced advertising allowances and incentives  in some cases 
many product suppliers provide us with advertising allowances  and in exchange  we feature their products in our catalogs and other marketing vehicles 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expenses 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory 
in the past  we have experienced a decrease in the level of vendor consideration available to us from certain manufacturers 
the level of such consideration we receive from some manufacturers may decline in the future 
such a decline could decrease our gross margin and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
we face many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with consumer electronics and computer retail stores  including superstores 
we also compete with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including cdw corporation  insight enterprises  inc  and dell inc  who are much larger than we are 
certain hardware and software vendors  such as hp  lenovo  and apple  who provide products to us  are also selling their products directly to end users through their own catalogs  stores  and via the internet 
we compete not only for customers  but also for advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of our competitors have 
table of contents larger catalog circulations and customer bases and greater financial  marketing  and other resources 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities  and adopt pricing policies that are more aggressive than ours 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors 
if we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors  our business may be harmed 
we face and will continue to face significant price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the personal computer industry  particularly in this current economic environment  and we expect pricing pressures to escalate if economic conditions worsen 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions  or otherwise 
also  our sales of personal computer hardware products are generally producing lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales  and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure to comply with our public sector contracts could result in  among other things  fines or liabilities 
revenues from the public sector segment are derived from sales to federal  state  and local government departments and agencies  as well as to educational institutions  through various contracts and open market sales 
government contracting is a highly regulated area 
noncompliance with government procurement regulations or contract provisions could result in civil  criminal  and administrative liability  including substantial monetary fines or damages  termination of government contracts  and suspension  debarment  or ineligibility from doing business with the government 
our current arrangements with these government agencies allow them to cancel orders with little or no notice and do not require them to purchase products from us in the future 
the effect of any of these possible actions by any government department or agency could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement our business strategy  we intend to continue  among other things  placing larger than typical inventory stocking orders of selected products and increasing our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
we may also  from time to time  make large inventory purchases of certain end of life products 
table of contents and market products on a private label basis  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  manufacturers are limiting return rights and are taking steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting configure to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these trends reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us  which could negatively impact our business 
we acquire products for resale from a limited number of vendors 
the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to us constituted   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from tech data corporation comprised   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from synnex corporation comprised   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from hp represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and if we were unable to acquire products from ingram  tech data  synnex  or hp  we could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products  and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice 
most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption  or contraction of relationships with our vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
some product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as us 
an element of our business strategy is to continue increasing our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
we could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or if we face the reemergence of significant availability constraints 
we could experience system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders 
we depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems  including our telephone system 
many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems  including our ability to purchase  sell  and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  and our ability to maintain operations 
our management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database 
although we maintain some redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in our management information systems or in our telephone communication systems  including those resulting from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure  or similar events  would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we are dependent on key personnel 
our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire  train  and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including sales representatives and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  train  and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives 
the methods of distributing personal computers and related products are changing  and such changes may negatively impact us and our business 
the manner in which personal computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as online shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
some of our vendors  including apple  hp  and lenovo  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend heavily on third party shippers to deliver our products to customers 
many of our customers elect to have their purchases shipped by an interstate common carrier  such as ups or fedex corporation 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
we may experience potential increases in shipping  paper  and postage costs  which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could significantly impact the cost of producing and mailing our catalogs and shipping customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically  and we have no control over future increases 
we have a long term contract with ups  and believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with our carriers 
we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services 
we also incur substantial paper and postage costs related to our marketing activities  including producing and mailing our catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical  and we have experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations  particularly if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
we rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
we have had an increasing level of sales made via the internet in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
sales of computer products via the internet represent a significant and 
table of contents increasing portion of overall computer product sales 
growth of our internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
we cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 
our success in growing our internet business will depend in large part upon our development of an increasingly sophisticated infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may overwhelm our existing internet infrastructure 
additionally  our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by  and reliant upon  the sophistication  speed  reliability  and cost effectiveness of the networks operated by third parties  and these networks may not continue to be developed or be available at prices consistent with our required business model 
we face uncertainties relating to the collection of state sales and use tax 
we collect and remit sales and use taxes in states in which we have either voluntarily registered or have a physical presence 
various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales and use taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales and use tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
additionally  certain states have adopted rules that require companies and their affiliates to register in those states as a condition of doing business with those state agencies 
moreover  due to our presence on various forms of electronic media and other operational factors  our contacts with many states may exceed the limited contacts involved in the supreme court case 
we cannot predict the level of contacts that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on us a sales or use tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position  or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  or if a court were to determine that our contacts with a state exceed the constitutionally permitted contacts  the expansion of a sales or use tax collection obligation on us in states to which we ship products would result in additional administrative expenses to us  could result in tax liability for past sales as well as price increases to our customers  and could reduce future sales 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business 
we mail catalogs and send electronic messages to names in our proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
world wide public concern regarding personal privacy has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could negatively affect our business 
we are controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  our two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend  or repeal our charter and our bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that 
table of contents might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of our company 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our public stockholders 
in connection with our initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed substantially all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties in november we entered into a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters and telemarketing center located at milford road  merrimack  new hampshire  with an affiliated entity  g h post  which is related to us through common ownership 
the total lease is valued at approximately million  based upon an independent property appraisal obtained at the date of lease  and interest is calculated at an annual rate of 
the lease  as amended  requires us to pay our proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges as either additional rent or directly to third parties and also to pay insurance premiums for the leased property 
we have the option to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each 
the lease has been recorded as a capital lease in the financial statements 
in august  our subsidiary merrimack services corporation entered into a lease agreement with g h post  which is related to us through common ownership  for an office facility adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of ten years and provides merrimack services corporation an option to renew the lease for two additional two year terms  at the then comparable market rate 
the lease requires us to pay our proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges as either additional rent or directly to third parties and also to pay insurance premiums for the leased property 
the lease has been recorded as an operating lease in the financial statements 
we also lease  square feet in two facilities in wilmington  ohio  which houses our distribution and order fulfillment operations 
the leases governing these two facilities expire in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  and contain provisions to renew for additional terms 
we also operate sales and support offices in keene and portsmouth  new hampshire  marlborough  massachusetts  rockville  maryland  dakota dunes  south dakota  and boca raton  florida  and lease facilities at these locations 
leasehold improvements associated with these properties are amortized over the terms of the leases or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we believe that existing or otherwise available distribution facilities in wilmington  ohio will be sufficient to support our anticipated needs through the next twelve months and beyond 
item legal proceedings we are subject to audits by states on sales and income taxes  unclaimed property  and other assessments 
a comprehensive multi state unclaimed property audit is in progress  and total accruals for unclaimed property aggregated million at december  while management believes that known and estimated liabilities have been adequately provided for  it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
additional liabilities could be asserted  and such outcome could have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  which have arisen during the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

see item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading direct marketer of a wide range of it solutions 
we help companies design  enable  manage  and service their it environments 
we provide products and services  including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications  and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers  distributors  and other suppliers 
we also offer a growing range of installation  configuration  repair  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium sized businesses  or smbs  through our pc connection sales subsidiary  b large enterprise customers  or large account  through our moredirect subsidiary  and c federal  state  and local government and educational institutions  or public sector  through our govconnection subsidiary 
we generate sales primarily through outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by account managers focused on the business  education  and government markets  our websites  and inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media 
we seek to recruit  retain  and increase the productivity of our sales personnel through training  mentoring  financial incentives based on performance  and updating and streamlining our information systems to make our operations more efficient 
as a value added reseller in the it supply chain  we do not manufacture it hardware or software 
we are dependent on our suppliers that consist of manufacturers and distributors that historically have sold only to resellers rather than directly to end users 
certain manufacturers have on multiple occasions attempted to sell directly to our customers  and in some cases have restricted our ability to sell their products directly to certain customers  thereby eliminating our role 
we believe that the success of direct sales efforts by suppliers will depend on their ability to meet our customers ongoing demands and provide objective  unbiased solutions to meet their needs 
we believe that more of our customers are seeking total it solutions  rather than simply specific it products 
our advantage is our ability to be product neutral and provide a broader combination of products  services  and advice tailored to customer needs 
we intend to provide customers with customized solutions from a variety of manufacturers  thereby attempting to mitigate the negative impact of continued supplier direct sales initiatives 
for example  through the formation of our services group  proconnection  we are able to provide customers complete it solutions  from identifying their needs  to designing  developing  and managing the integration of products and services to implement their it projects 
such service offerings carry higher margins than traditional product sales 
additionally  the technical certifications of our service engineers permit us to offer higher end  more complex products that also carry higher gross margins 
we expect these service offerings and technical certifications to continue to play a role in sales generation and improved gross margins in this competitive environment 
market conditions and technology advances significantly affect the demand for our products and services 
virtual delivery of software products and advanced internet technology providing customers enhanced functionality have substantially increased customer expectations  requiring us to invest more heavily in our own it development to meet these new demands 
as buying trends change and electronic commerce continues to grow  customers become more sophisticated and have more choices than ever before 
customers are also better able to make price comparisons through the internet  thereby increasing price competition 
these conditions could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
while it is not possible for us to estimate with any degree of accuracy the level of sales we may have lost or may lose in the future as a result of such increased buyer sophistication  our internet sales to consumers  which represented approximately of total sales  decreased during the last four years by 

table of contents we have also undertaken significant actions with respect to all of our internet websites  including those that serve our smb and enterprise segments  in order to keep up with the improvements made by our competitors 
we have increased the level of internet marketing expenditures on third party click fees and affiliate charges  particularly with respect to consumer marketing  in order to increase visibility on third party search engines 
we have also launched various promotions  including selected free freight offers  in efforts to generate higher internet sales 
all of these activities are costly  aggregating million in  and decrease our operating results accordingly 
these costs are expected to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our internet visibility and functionality  and if we do not generate increased internet sales  our operating margins may be further impacted 
the primary challenges we face in effectively managing our business are increasing our revenues in the face of global economic uncertainty  while at the same time  maintaining  if not improving  our gross profit margins in all three business segments  recruiting  retaining  and improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively controlling our sg a expenses over a possible lower sales base 
if recent declines in it spending repeat in  any significant sales growth for us must come through increased market share 
competition may become even more intense in the future  which could put more pressure on margins 
given the deterioration in the demand environment  management implemented cost reductions late in the first quarter of to lower expenses 
we reduced headcount across all of our operations by employees  in the first quarter of this reduction in personnel consisted primarily of support personnel but included some sales personnel as well 
the savings realized from this reduction was million 
on an annualized basis  these savings total approximately million 
however  management was not able to reduce operating expenses proportional to the decline in revenues experienced in  and as a result  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales increased in compared to we believe our cost reduction efforts will result in comparable ongoing structural savings in future periods  because our overall sales productivity will increase  and the efficiency of our various support functions will improve 
our support function costs are largely fixed within certain ranges of revenue  we plan to increase costs in future periods only as we experience step increases over wider ranges of revenue growth

special charges totaled million in and consisted of a non cash asset write off of million and million of workforce reduction and management restructuring charges 
we recognized the asset write off after we determined to stop further development of an internally developed crm software module 
the asset write off represented the capitalized costs of the crm module  and as a result  the charge had no impact on

as discussed above  we incurred in an million charge related to the write off of an internally developed crm module  and in we incurred an million goodwill impairment charge  which represented the entire goodwill balances held by two operating segments 
we do not expect in the foreseeable future to develop internally any software project similar in size to the crm software module  and as a result  believe it unlikely that we would recognize a significant asset impairment in future financial statements 
in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  we discuss the impact of a goodwill impairment on our operating results 
we do not expect in the foreseeable future to incur a goodwill impairment charge 
we believe that the presentation of our operating results excluding the asset and goodwill impairments would be useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency  facilitate comparisons to prior periods  and assist them in forecasting our future performance  because investors typically exclude items we believe to be outside of normal operating results 
such pro forma presentation would not be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  however  we use non gaap measures to evaluate financial performance against planned amounts  to calculate incentive compensation  and to assist in forecasting future performance

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  repurchases of common stock for treasury  and as opportunities arise  possible acquisitions of new businesses 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit and inventory trade credit agreements  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures  excluding any expenditures on new it systems  of to million and payments on capital and contractual obligations of approximately million 
in july we began a comprehensive review and assessment of our entire business software needs  following the write off of an uncompleted internally developed crm software module 
that review and assessment includes the review of commercially available software that meets  or can be configured to meet  those needs better than our existing software 
while we have not yet finalized any decisions regarding whether or to what extent new software will be acquired and implemented  such a project  if fully implemented  could exceed million over a five year period 
we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december   we had approximately million in unrestricted accounts 
cash generated from operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and balancing net changes in inventories and receivables with compensating changes in payables to generate a positive cash flow 
historically  we have consistently generated positive cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding against our million bank line of credit which is available through october this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for it products continues to decline  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected

summary sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the last three years in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in compared to the prior year 
operating cash flow in resulted primarily from net income before non cash asset impairment and depreciation  as well as an increase in accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable increased by million in from the prior year end level due to an increase in days sales outstanding  or dso s  and higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year period 
dso s increased to days at december   compared to days at december   as a result of increased sales in to public sector customers  who generally have longer payment terms compared to our corporate customers 
inventory increased year over year by million in  which we attribute to increased inventory in transit from our vendors associated with higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year period 
however  inventory turns improved to turns at december   compared to turns at december  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   resulted primarily from net income before non cash goodwill impairment and depreciation  as well as decreases in accounts receivables and inventory  offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and an increase in accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence  or earlier when favorable cash discounts are offered 
this balance will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under inventory trade credit agreements we use to finance our purchase of certain inventory  secured by the inventory so financed 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities decreased by million in compared to these activities consist of capital expenditures in the three years presented  primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software  offset by proceeds from the sale of disposed capital assets 
cash used for financing activities decreased year over year by million in primarily due to reduced purchases of treasury shares 
we repurchased  shares at a total cost of million in an average price of per share 
in addition  we withheld  shares  having an aggregate fair value of million  upon the vesting of stock awards to satisfy related employee tax obligations during the year ended december  these repurchases were placed in treasury and are available for future equity grants or retirement 
cash used by financing activities in related primarily to the purchase of treasury stock and the repayment of capital lease obligations 
we repurchased  shares at a total cost of million and withheld  shares  having an aggregate fair value of million  to satisfy related employee tax obligations in cash provided by financing activities in related primarily to proceeds of million from option exercises in debt instruments  contractual agreements  and related covenants below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities and other contractual obligations 
for more information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and inventory financing agreements  see factors affecting sources of liquidity below 
for more information about our obligations  commitments  and contingencies  see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
bank line of credit 
our bank line of credit provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to million at the prime rate at december  
in addition  we have the option to increase the facility by an additional million  based on sufficient levels of trade receivables to meet borrowing base requirements  and depending on meeting minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and equity requirements  described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
the facility also gives us the option of obtaining eurodollar rate loans in multiples of million for various short term durations 

table of contents substantially all of our assets are collateralized as security for this facility  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
at december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
this facility  which matures in october  operates under an automatic cash management program whereby disbursements in excess of available cash are added as borrowings at the time disbursement checks clear the bank  and available cash receipts are first applied against any outstanding borrowings and then invested in short term qualified cash investments 
accordingly  borrowings under the line are classified as current 
inventory trade credit agreements 
we have additional security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for up to financing on the purchase price  up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase their products 
amounts outstanding under such facilities  equal to million as of december   are recorded in accounts payable  and the inventory financed is classified as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet 
standby letter of credit 
we issued a standby letter of credit for million in december to guarantee a rebate payment to a customer on a january sales transaction 
we made the rebate payment in january  thereby settling the obligation  and accordingly requested that the bank cancel the letter of credit 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations sports marketing commitments total including interest  excluding taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
excluding taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
capital leases 
we have a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership 
in addition to the rent payable under the facility lease  we are required to pay real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see contractual obligations above for lease commitments under these leases 

table of contents sports marketing commitments 
we have entered into multi year sponsorship agreements with the boston red sox and the new england patriots that extend to and  respectively 
these agreements  which grant us various marketing rights and seating arrangements  require annual payments aggregating from million to million per year 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  stock repurchases  dividends and other distributions  investments  and liens with which we and all of our subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit  but would also constitute a default 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters must not be more than to we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in the fourth quarter of  and accordingly the funded debt ratio did not limit potential borrowings at december  future decreases in our consolidated ebitda  however  could limit our potential borrowings under the credit facility 
minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter  beginning with the quarter ended march  such amount was calculated at december   as million  whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at this date was million 
the borrowing base under this facility is set at of qualified commercial receivables  plus of qualified government receivables 
as of december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently 
table of contents uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with certain customers  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on significant historical experience and record our sales reserves as a reduction of revenues and either as offsets to accounts receivable or  for customers who have already paid  as credits to accrued expenses 
at december   we recorded sales reserves of million and million as components of accounts receivable and accrued expenses  respectively 
at december   we recorded sales reserves of million and million as components of accounts receivable and accrued expenses  respectively 
all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  represent revenues earned for the goods provided  and these amounts have been classified as net sales 
costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales 
sales are reported net of sales  use  or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities 
revenue for third party service contracts is recorded on a net sales recognition basis because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in these transactions 
for such contracts  we evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor  and the entire selling process is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider recorded as a cost of sales 
under net sales recognition  we are not the primary obligor  and the cost to the third party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales  with no cost of goods sold  thus leaving the gross profit as the reported net sale for the transaction 
similarly  we recognize revenue from agency sales transactions on a net sales basis 
in agency sales transactions  we facilitate product sales by equipment and software manufacturers directly to our customers and receive agency  or referral  fees for such transactions 
we do not take title to the products or assume any maintenance or return obligations in these transactions  title is passed directly from the supplier to our customer 
net amounts included in revenue for such third party service contracts and agency sales transactions were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
although service revenues represent a small percentage of our consolidated revenues  we offer a growing range of services  including installation  configuration  repair  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
if a service is performed in conjunction with the delivery of hardware  software  or another service  then we determine whether an item included in such multiple element arrangements constitutes a separate deliverable 

table of contents in these arrangements  an element is separated as a deliverable only when the following three conditions are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially under our control 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current creditworthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  a change in estimates could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur additional charges in the future on our consolidated statements of operations 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for price protections  discounts  product rebates  and other programs 
these allowances are treated as a reduction of the vendor s prices and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory  as applicable 
we also receive vendor co op advertising funding for our catalogs and other programs 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs or fund other advertising activities for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of the underlying incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory 
our vendor partners generally consolidate their funding of advertising and other marketing programs  and as a result  we classify substantially all vendor allowances as a reduction of cost of inventory purchases rather than a reduction of advertising expense 
the level of allowances received from certain merchandise vendors has declined in past years and may do so again 
such a decline could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
inventories inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems  and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under a weighted average cost method which approximates the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non salable inventory  based primarily on management s 
table of contents forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions  which could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have historically ranged between million and million per annum 
historically  there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
contingencies from time to time we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria found under us gaap 
we are also subject to audits by states on sales and income taxes  unclaimed property  and other assessments 
a multi state unclaimed property audit is currently in progress  and certain sales tax audits may be imminent 
while management believes that known liabilities have been adequately provided for  it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
additional liabilities could be asserted  and such outcome could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
value of goodwill and long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we have historically reviewed the carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the year ended december  to write off the entire goodwill balances held by the smb and public sector segments 
our large account segment which is the only reporting unit with goodwill remaining  however  continues to carry million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
while we believe that our estimates of fair value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially affect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those remaining assets in our large account segment 
we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived trademark impairment test on the first day of and determined that the fair value of our large account reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  and as a result  no impairment resulted 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of each unit s future operating results 
the significant assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis include projected cash flows and profitability  the discount rate used to present value future cash flows  working capital requirements  and terminal growth rates 
cash flows and profitability assumptions include sales growth  gross margin  and sg a growth assumptions which are generally based on historical trends 
the discount rate used is a market participant weighted average cost of capital waac 
at our annual testing as of january   we used a waac rate of and estimated terminal growth rate at and working capital requirements at of revenues 
share based compensation we measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees and recognize that cost  adjusted for forfeitures  over the period that such services are performed in our consolidated financial statements as 
table of contents further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation includes an estimate of forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures experienced differ from these estimates 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future  based on enacted tax laws and rates anticipated to be applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we account for uncertain tax positions based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
recently issued financial accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
these amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
we expect to adopt the amendments beginning january  the new guidance modifies the criteria for the separation of deliverables into units of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
we have not yet determined the effect that adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial statements 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
no borrowings were outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december   and our average outstanding borrowing during was minimal 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material
