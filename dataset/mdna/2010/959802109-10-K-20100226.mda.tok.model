overview we are a leading provider of money transfer services  operating in two business segments consumer to consumer money transfer services  provided primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency  real time money transfer processing systems 
this service is available for international cross border transfers that is  the transfer of funds from one country to another and  in certain countries  intra country transfers that is  money transfers from one location to another in the same country 
global business payments formerly consumer to business  which allows for the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses 
our business payments service allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations  including utilities  auto finance companies  mortgage servicers  financial service providers  government agencies and other businesses 
on september   we acquired canada based custom house  ltd 
custom house  a provider of international business to business payment services  which is included in this segment 
custom house facilitates cross border  cross currency payment transactions 
while we continue to pursue further international expansion of our offerings in this segment  the segment s revenue was primarily generated in the united states during all periods presented 
businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as other and primarily includes our money order services  and represented or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended december   and prior to october   our money orders were issued by integrated payment systems inc ips  a subsidiary of first data corporation first data  to consumers at retail locations primarily in the united states and canada 
effective october   we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders 
also included in other are expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings  including costs to develop mobile money transfer services  new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions 
significant financial and other highlights significant financial and other highlights for the year ended december  included we generated  million in total consolidated revenues  representing a year over year decline of 
this decline was partially offset by the acquisition of custom house  which contributed million to revenue for we generated  million in consolidated operating income compared to  million for the comparable period in the prior year  representing a decrease of 
operating income for the year ended december  included an accrual of million resulting from an anticipated agreement and settlement which resolves all outstanding legal issues and claims with the state of 
table of contents arizona and requires us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border  in which california  texas and new mexico will participate with arizona the settlement accrual 
the settlement agreement was signed on february  results for included million in restructuring and related expenses 
our operating income margin was during the year ended december   resulting in a year over year decline of 
the current year results included the settlement accrual  while the prior year results included the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above 
consolidated net income during was million  representing a decline of from the current results included the settlement accrual of million  net of tax  while the prior year results included million in restructuring and related expenses  net of tax 
our consumers transferred billion in consumer to consumer principal  of which billion related to cross border principal  which represented a decrease of in both consumer to consumer principal and cross border principal over the prior year 
consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were  million  a decrease of over we completed two acquisitions in the year ended december  in february  we completed the acquisition of the money transfer business of one of our largest agents  european based fexco  for million  including million of cash consideration 
as described earlier  we acquired custom house in september for cash consideration of million 
factors that we believe are important to our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our existing consumer to consumer business  innovating to provide new products and services  including electronic channels  to our intended consumer  expanding our global business payments segment to other markets across the world through our cross border  cross currency payment service offerings and improving our profitability by leveraging our scale  reducing costs and effectively utilizing capital 
significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses 
transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by  among other things  the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  a reduction in the size of the migrant population  interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns or political events  could adversely affect our transaction volume 
for discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods  refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below 
revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers  the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
we intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors 
decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
a majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions  which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue 
the impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program 

table of contents spin off from first data we were incorporated in delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of first data on february  on september   first data distributed of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a western union money transfer agent  as well as related assets  including real estate  through a tax free distribution to first data shareholders spin off through this previously owned subsidiary 
basis of presentation the financial statements in this annual report on form k are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our company s segments have been eliminated 
adoption of accounting standards business combinations we adopted a new accounting standard related to accounting for business combinations and noncontrolling interests effective january  under the new guidance  acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in estimates for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period  which is one year or less  impact income tax expense in the period of change 
for business combinations achieved in stages  the new guidance requires that we re measure any noncontrolling equity investments in the acquiree to fair value as of the acquisition date immediately before obtaining control 
all re measurement gains and losses are recognized in earnings and the total fair values of the identifiable assets  liabilities and any noncontrolling interests are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
fair value measurements we monitor our investments in debt securities to determine if these securities are in an other than temporary impairment position under new accounting guidance introduced in factors that could indicate an impairment exists include  but are not limited to earnings performance  changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or economic environment of the asset 
if potential impairments exist  we assess whether or not we intend to sell the debt security  and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell it  before its anticipated recovery 
we had no material other than temporary impairments during the years ended december   and components of revenues and expenses the following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income 
descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements 
transaction fees transaction fees are charged for sending money transfers and for global business payments services 
consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent 
transaction fees represented of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenue in certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different currencies  we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been primarily driven by growth in international cross currency transactions 
as a result of the acquisition of custom house  our foreign exchange revenues have increased and we expect this trend to continue in foreign exchange revenue represented of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  
table of contents commission and other revenues commission and other revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in connection with the sale of money orders  enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our equity accelerator program a recurring mortgage payment service program and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer  money order and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets 
as described above  prior to october   our money orders were issued by ips  from whom we received a commission

although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement ie  spot rate changes  the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur 
derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer to consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions 
gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our international business to business payments operations 
the impact of these contracts is classified within foreign exchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
other income  net other income  net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and other income and expenses

table of contents revenues overview compared to the majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue were contributed by our consumer to consumer segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion 
consolidated revenue declined during the year ended december  the revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth  and to a lesser extent  geographic mix  product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions  and price decreases 
also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year  which adversely impacted revenue by approximately  as discussed below 
the europe  middle east  africa and south asia emeasa region of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
the revenue declines were driven by most of the same factors discussed above 
the acquisition of fexco s money transfer business did not have an impact on our revenue as we were already recognizing of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at fexco s locations 
the americas region including north america  latin america  the caribbean and south america of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue and transaction declines due to the overall weak united states economy 
our americas results were further impacted by pricing reductions taken in the united states in the fourth quarter of which improved our transaction volumes  but contributed to the decline in revenue 
the global business payments segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion  also experienced revenue declines during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding prior period 
revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the united states  which resulted in a revenue decline in our united states cash and electronic bill payments businesses 
offsetting these declines in were the results of our custom house acquisition  which contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  over primarily due to foreign exchange revenue from custom house 
excluding the impact of custom house  foreign exchange revenue decreased at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended december  of million over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the impact to earnings per share during the period was less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program 
the majority of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is related to the emeasa region 
compared to consolidated revenue growth of during the year ended december  was primarily driven by revenue growth internationally  particularly in the emeasa region  due to increased money transfers at existing agent locations  and to a lesser extent  money transfers at new agent locations and due to the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  specifically the euro  discussed below 
our international consumer to consumer transactions that were originated outside of the united states also continued to experience strong revenue and transaction growth for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 

table of contents however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on western union customers 
in the fourth quarter  transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of in addition  the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of these factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar for the year ended december  resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million  over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign currency exchange rates increasing against the united states dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share 
the benefit in the first three quarters of was slightly offset by the negative impact to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of due to the strengthening of the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies  including the euro 
however  the impact to our operating income was positive to the fourth quarter of due to our derivative hedges 
our asia pacific apac region also experienced strong transaction and revenue growth during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding previous period  including growth contributed by the inbound market to the philippines 
revenue growth slowed in apac during the fourth quarter compared to the same period in  in part due to the weakening global economy described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in china 
within our americas region  our united states to mexico  united states outbound and transactions in our domestic between and within the united states and canada businesses continued to be impacted by the overall weakening in the united states economy 
the immigration debate and market softness  in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry  began adversely impacting the united states businesses in the second quarter of we responded to these factors by launching distribution  pricing  advertising  promotion and community outreach initiatives in and although the united states businesses revenue decline experienced in moderated compared with  we experienced increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  due to the weakening in the united states economy 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  over the corresponding previous period  due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth in international consumer to consumer transactions 
as described above  foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended december  compared to from the strengthening of other currencies most notably the euro  against the united states dollar 
operating expenses overview the following factors impacted both cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses during the periods presented restructuring and related activities for the year ended december   restructuring and related expenses of million and million are classified within cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
these restructuring and related expenses are associated with the closure of our facilities in missouri and texas and other reorganization plans executed in no expenses were recognized for these restructurings in stock compensation charge at the time of the spin off  first data converted stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units collectively  stock based awards of first data stock held by western union and first data employees 
both western union and first data 
table of contents employees received converted western union stock based awards 
all converted stock based awards  which had not vested prior to september   were subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the original first data stock based awards  including change of control provisions which require full vesting upon a change of control of first data 
accordingly  upon the completion of the acquisition of first data on september  by an affiliate of kkr  all of these remaining converted unvested western union stock based awards vested 
in connection with this accelerated vesting  we incurred a non cash pre tax charge of million during the third quarter of approximately one third of this charge was recorded within cost of services and two thirds was recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
cost of services cost of services decreased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to agent commissions  which decreased due to revenue declines  as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of fexco and other selective consumer to consumer commission initiatives 
also impacting cost of services was the strengthening of the united states dollar for most of compared to most other foreign currencies  which resulted in a favorable impact on the translation of our expenses  and restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in and the related cost savings 
these costs were offset by incremental operating costs  including increased technology costs and costs associated with custom house 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was generally due to reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of fexco and selective consumer to consumer agent commission initiatives  restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in and the related cost savings  offset somewhat by incremental operating costs  including increased technology costs and costs associated with custom house 
in addition to the restructuring costs described above  cost of services increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to agent commissions which increase as revenues increase 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was primarily due to restructuring and related expenses of million as described above  and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international consumer to consumer business  which carries higher cost of services compared to our united states originated businesses 
selected consumer to consumer international agent commissions have been lowered but were partially offset by certain higher commissions in the united states 
in addition  a higher percentage of our global business payments services were generated from our united states electronic based payments and payments related to pago f cil  each of which had higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue compared to our united states cash based payments business 
the increase was partially offset by lower stock compensation charges for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  as described above and below  that did not recur in selling  general and administrative sg a increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual described below  incremental costs associated with the acquisitions of fexco and custom house including costs related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other increased operating expenses  offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses  and restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in during the year ended december   we recorded an accrual of million for an anticipated agreement and settlement with the state of arizona 
on february   we signed this agreement and settlement  which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the state and requires us to fund a 
table of contents multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border  in which california  texas and new mexico will participate with arizona 
the accrual includes amounts for reimbursement to the state of arizona for its costs associated with this matter 
in addition  as part of the agreement and settlement  we expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the united states and mexico border and to engage a monitor of that program  which are expected to cost up to million over the next two to four years 
sg a expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher employee compensation expenses and restructuring and related expenses of million  offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses as well as lower stock compensation charges in  as described above 
during the years ended december   and  marketing related expenditures  principally classified within sg a  were approximately to of revenue 
marketing related expenditures include advertising  events  loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities 
when making decisions with respect to marketing investments  we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments  as discussed in segment discussion  for consumer to consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments 
interest income interest income decreased during both the year ended december  compared to and the year ended december  compared to primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower average interest bearing cash balances 
interest expense interest expense decreased for both the year ended december  compared to and the year ended december  compared to due to lower short term interest rates on certain debt with floating interest rates 
in addition  lower average borrowing balances impacted the decline in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the previous year 
derivative losses gains  net changes in derivative losses gains  net were immaterial for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
volatility in foreign currency forward rates compared to spot rates  primarily related to the euro  resulted in the decrease to income for the year ended december  compared to other income  net other income  net decreased during the year ended december  compared to due to a million reserve taken against our receivable from the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd 
and a decline in earnings on our equity method investments in  primarily as a result of the absence of equity method earnings for fexco subsequent to the acquisition date 
changes in other income  net during the year ended december  compared to the previous corresponding year was primarily attributable to fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments 
income taxes our effective tax rates on pretax income were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
in addition  during  we implemented additional foreign tax efficient strategies consistent with our overall tax planning which impacted our effective tax rate for all subsequent periods 

table of contents recent proposed changes to united states tax laws  if enacted  could potentially adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
we are closely monitoring the proposed changes  and the potential effect on our future effective tax rate will depend on the final form of any new law 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures  including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in  whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue  and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows 
the united states internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the united states federal consolidated income tax returns of first data for and  of which we are a part  and issued a notice of deficiency in december the notice of deficiency alleges significant additional taxes  interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries  and we generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these potential western union related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement with first data executed at the time of the spin off 
we agree with a number of the adjustments in the notice of deficiency  however  we do not agree with the notice of deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of approximately million 
as of december   interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments would be approximately million 
a substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates to our international restructuring  which took effect in the fourth quarter  and  accordingly  the alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are attributable to on march   we filed a petition in the united states tax court contesting those adjustments with which we do not agree 
we believe our overall reserves are adequate  including those associated with adjustments alleged in the notice of deficiency 
if the irs position in the notice of deficiency is sustained  our tax provision related to and later years would materially increase  which could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
earnings per share during the years ended december   and  basic earnings per share were  and  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively 
unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested 
as of december   and  there were million  million and million  respectively  of outstanding options to purchase shares of western union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti dilutive 
the increase in anti dilutive shares in was primarily due to the majority of our outstanding options having an exercise price higher than our average market price for the year ended december  of the million  million and million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of december   and  respectively  approximately  and  respectively  were held by employees of first data 
earnings per share decreased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding previous period as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income  offset by lower weighted 
table of contents average shares outstanding 
earnings per share increased during the year ended december  compared to due to the increased net income as a result of the previously described factors and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
the lower number of shares outstanding was driven by stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in both and compared to the corresponding periods

table of contents transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue compared to consumer to consumer money transfer revenue declined on transaction growth of for the year ended december  over the revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth  and to a lesser extent  geographic mix  product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions  and price decreases

revenue and transaction growth for both india and the gulf states slowed throughout the year ended december  compared to due to the economic conditions in the gulf states  transaction growth rates declined to single digits in the fourth quarter and we expect slowing transaction growth to impact americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in contributing to the overall decline in the americas region was the domestic business transactions between and within the united states and canada which experienced a revenue decline of on a transaction decline of for the year ended december  the repositioning of the domestic business  including pricing reductions taken in the united states in the fourth quarter of  improved our americas and domestic transaction volumes  but contributed to the decline in revenue 
our mexico business also contributed to the overall decline in the americas region with a revenue decline of on a transaction decline of for the year ended december  our united states domestic and mexico business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the united states 
our mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of certain vigo branded agents  substantially all of which were small retailers  due to credit concerns 
however  the decline in revenue for our united states outbound business moderated in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous nine months of as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth quarter of our apac revenue increased on transaction growth of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the apac region s revenues have been impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  as further described below  as well as moderating transaction growth 
china revenue grew on transaction growth for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenue decreased for the year ended december  over the corresponding previous period at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended december  of million over the same period in the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the majority of our exposure is related to the emeasa region 
we have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive 
table of contents factors 
fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
for the year ended december   such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately of total western union revenue compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations  new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  is often experienced as locations mature 
we believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
we generally refer to locations with more than of transactions being initiated versus paid as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations 
send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue 
they contribute more transactions per location than receive locations 
however  a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers 
the number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  migration patterns  the location s class of trade  hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering our services  regulatory limitations and competition 
each of the  agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services  however  not every location completes a transaction in a given period 
for example  as of december   more than of agent locations in the united states  canada and western europe representing at least one of our three money transfer brands western union  orlandi valuta and vigo sm experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
in the developing regions of asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations  approximately of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
we periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions 
compared to consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth was for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was driven by revenue growth of in our international business on transaction growth of 
our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states also continued to experience strong revenue growth for the year ended december  as a result of strong transaction growth 
however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on western union customers 
in the fourth quarter  transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of in addition  the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of these factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of revenue growth in our emeasa region was on transaction growth of for the year ended december  over the same period in the growth in our emeasa region during the year ended december   was primarily driven by transaction growth and the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  specifically the euro  as further described below 
contributing to the growth in the emeasa region was strong transaction growth of over in our money transfer business to india for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  resulting in revenue growth of over 
over the same period  revenue growth in the gulf states continued to be strong 
however  revenue growth in some european markets during the year ended december  slowed over the previous year  especially during the fourth quarter of as certain countries within europe  such as spain  experienced declines in the housing industry and rising unemployment 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar for the year ended december  resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million  over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rates increasing against the united states dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share 
americas revenue declined for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in but transactions grew for the same period 
the united states domestic and the united states outbound revenue continued to decline  due to the overall weakening in the united states economy and rising unemployment  for the year ended december  within the americas region  revenue declines in our domestic business  which represents approximately of consolidated revenue for the year ended december   continued to occur due to the factors described above 
although the domestic and united states outbound revenue declines experienced in moderated compared to those experienced in  we did experience increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  due to the further weakening in the united states economy 
domestic revenue declined on transaction declines of for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in in addition  united states telephone money transfer revenues continued to decline  and website money transfer revenues were flat for the year ended december  revenue in our mexico business was down on transaction declines of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the mexico business continued to be impacted by the weakening in the united states economy  noted earlier  with such declines increasing in the fourth quarter of during a few weeks in the fourth quarter  the value of the mexican peso decreased dramatically against the united states dollar and  as a result  we experienced a spike in transactions as united states senders took advantage of the more favorable exchange rates 
as the devaluation of the peso was sudden and unusual  we needed to acquire pesos at less favorable rates in order to meet the demand for immediate payout in mexico  which impacted the overall decline in revenue by less than million 
revenue and transaction growth in the apac region for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was driven by strong inbound growth to the region  especially to the philippines 
china revenue and transactions grew at and for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  respectively 
revenue growth rates slowed to china during the third quarter of  with revenue declining in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  in part due to the weakening economic situation described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in china 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth in international consumer to consumer transactions 
as described above  foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended december  compared to from the exchange rate between other currencies against the united states dollar  despite the negative impact of currency rate fluctuations in the fourth quarter of operating income compared to consumer to consumer operating income decreased during the year ended december  compared to due to the decline in revenue  incremental costs  including increased technology costs and the acquisition of fexco  offset somewhat by reduced agent commissions  savings realized from the restructurings and better leveraging of our marketing expenses  as described earlier 
the operating income margin for the year ended december  was consistent with compared to consumer to consumer operating income increased for the year ended december  compared to  primarily driven by higher revenue and related profits from increased transactions internationally and 
table of contents lower stock based compensation expenses 
of the million accelerated stock based compensation vesting charge in taken in connection with the change in control of first data  that did not recur in  million was allocated to this segment in during the year ended december  compared to  the operating income increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our united states businesses  and higher employee compensation expenses 
the ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business  which carries lower profit margins than in our united states originated business  also impacted consumer to consumer operating income during the year ended december  as described earlier in the revenues overview and due to the same factors  operating income growth for the consumer to consumer segment was lower in the fourth quarter of than that experienced in the previous nine months 
consumer to consumer operating income margin also increased during the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense  as described above 
this increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our united states businesses and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business  which carries lower profit margins than in our united states originated business as noted earlier 
however  we have been experiencing a convergence between international operating profits margins and profit margins of our united states originated businesses 
global business payments segment the following table sets forth our global business payments segment results of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  change dollars and transactions in millions vs 
vs 
revenues transaction fees foreign exchange revenue other revenues total revenues operating income operating income margin key indicator global business payments transactions calculation not meaningful revenues compared to during the year ended december   the global business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the united states  which resulted in a revenue decline in our united states cash and electronic bill payments businesses  partially offset by revenue generated from our recent acquisition of custom house  as described below  and slight growth in the pago f cil business 
we believe many united states consumers who would use our services are having difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit  resulting in our handling fewer bill payments 
due to a continued challenging united states economy and competitive pressure  we expect to see revenue declines in our united states consumer to business service offerings in similar to the declines we experienced in although the segment s revenues were primarily generated in the united states for the year ended december   we expect the proportion of international revenue  specifically foreign exchange revenue  will grow in future periods as a percentage of total revenue due to our acquisition of custom house 

table of contents on september   we completed the acquisition of canada based custom house  a provider of international business to business payment services 
custom house facilitates cross border  cross currency payment transactions 
the significant majority of custom house s revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments 
the credit risk arising from these spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely mitigated  as in the majority of cases custom house requires the receipt of funds from customers before releasing the associated cross currency payment 
in addition  this business writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for their customers to facilitate future payments 
the duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less 
the significant majority of custom house s revenue is generated from transactions involving different currencies  in which custom house generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by custom house to the customer and the rate at which custom house is able to acquire currency or forward and option contracts 
this foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the customer initiates a transaction with custom house 
the acquisition of custom house contributed million to total revenue  primarily included in foreign exchange revenue  and approximately  transactions for the year ended december  transaction growth during the year ended december  compared to was driven by our pago f cil cash based and united states electronic based bill payments businesses 
both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction than our united states cash based bill payment business 
the transaction growth was offset by a decline in the united states cash based bill payments business 
compared to during the year ended december   overall revenue was flat compared to the corresponding period in  as revenue growth in the pago f cil business was offset by a decline in united states cash based bill payment revenue 
the global business payments segment  including the united states electronic based bill payments business which experienced flat revenues year over year  was adversely impacted in the last half of due to the weakening economy in the united states 
some consumers who were likely to use our services were having difficulty paying their bills and were unable to obtain credit in any form  resulting in us handling fewer bill payments 
operating income compared to for the year ended december   operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to operating income declines related to the united states based bill payments business and operating and integration costs associated with the acquisition of custom house  offset slightly by the savings generated from the restructurings 
the decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the decline in the united states cash based bill payments business which has a higher operating income margin than our south america and electronic businesses 
compared to operating income for the global business payments segment decreased for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to operating income declines in the united states based bill payments businesses  partially offset by growth in pago f cil payments 
operating income margins also declined as united states electronic based and pago f cil payments  which cumulatively represented a higher percentage of global business payments revenues in compared to  have lower operating margins than the declining higher margin united states cash based bill payments business 
partially offsetting operating income declines for the year ended december  compared to was lower stock based compensation expenses as described in the consumer to consumer operating income discussion 

table of contents other the following table sets forth other results for the years ended december   and years ended december  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
revenues operating income operating income margin revenues compared to revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is comprised primarily of our money order services business 
in the fourth quarter  we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue recognized related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of from ips on the outstanding money order balances as described below 
however  we now derive investment income from actual interest generated on our money order settlement assets  which are primarily held in united states tax exempt state and municipal securities 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
through a combination of the revenue generated from these investment securities and the anticipated interest expense savings resulting from these interest rate swaps  we estimate that we should be able to retain  a materially comparable after tax rate of return through as we were receiving under the agreement with ips 
however  the results of interest expense savings related to the swaps will be reflected in interest expense and will not impact operating income 
effective october   in accordance with the agreement signed on july   ips  a subsidiary of first data  assigned and transferred to us certain operating assets used by ips to issue western union branded money orders and approximately million of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities 
on the transition date  we assumed ips s role as issuer of the money orders  including its obligation to pay outstanding money orders  and terminated the existing agreement whereby ips paid western union a fixed return of on the outstanding money order balances 
following the transition date  we invested the cash received from ips in high quality  investment grade securities  primarily tax exempt united states state and municipal securities  in accordance with applicable regulations  which are the same as those currently governing the investment of our united states originated money transfer principal 
compared to revenue increased for the year ended december  over the same period in due to revenue growth in our prepaid services business generated outside of the united states 
operating income compared to during the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of as described above 
compared to for the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was driven by operating income declines related to our money order services business  costs incurred to develop mobile money transfer services and our prepaid business within the united states  offset by increased revenue and related profits from our prepaid services business outside of the united states 

table of contents further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue  operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities  driven primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital 
our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings  timing of income tax payments  and collections on receivables  among other items 
the majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters  and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters 
our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors  some of which are out of our control  including changes in economic conditions  especially those impacting the migrant population  and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits  including the resolution of outstanding tax matters 
in  we are considering making a million refundable tax deposit relating to potential united states federal tax liabilities arising from our international restructuring 
by making the deposit  interest charges related to the amount of the deposit will cease 
to the extent the deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax liabilities  it is refundable with interest 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries  some of which are regulated entities 
these subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use  except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
the assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions include those located in countries outside of the united states containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained by a regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the united states in accordance with applicable state regulations 
significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs  including dividends and share repurchases  through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations 
in addition  we have capacity to borrow on our billion revolving credit facility which was undrawn at december  and expires in september cash and investment securities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which million was held by our foreign entities 
our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause united states and foreign cash balances to fluctuate 
repatriating foreign funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally 
in many cases  we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services and money orders before we settle the payment of those transactions 
these funds  referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are not used to support our operations 
however  we earn income from investing these funds 
we maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments  classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets  to fund settlement obligations 
investment securities  included in settlement assets  were billion as of december  effective october   ips assigned and transferred to us certain operating assets used by ips to issue western union branded money orders and approximately million of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities which contributed to the increase in our investment securities from december  to december  most state regulators in the united states require us to maintain specific high quality  investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement 
table of contents obligations in accordance with applicable regulations 
we do not hold investment securities for trading purposes  and all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
under the payment services directive psd in the european union  we expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities  which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current portfolio 
investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments  including diversifying our investment portfolio 
as of december   the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration 
as of december   there were no investments with a single issuer or individual securities representing more than of our investment securities portfolio 
cash flows from operating activities during the years ended december   and  cash provided by operating activities was  million   million and  million  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from to due to lower net income  offset by working capital fluctuations in including the settlement accrual and the timing of tax payments

as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and had billion available to borrow 
our revolving credit facility  which is diversified through a group of participating institutions  is used to provide general liquidity for us and to support our commercial paper program  which we believe enhances our short term credit rating 
the largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of billion is approximately 
the substantial majority of the banks within this group were rated at least an a or better as of december  if the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased  or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated  the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted

credit ratings and debt covenants the credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms 
factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings  cash flow generation  leverage  available liquidity and overall business risks 
our revolving credit facility contains an interest rate margin  facility fee and utilization fee  all of which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions in our notes and certain of our derivative contracts which would require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade

table of contents us to fund approximately million to the plans in  which is less than was previously anticipated 
in addition  we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million for a total contribution of million to the plans in our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was december  the calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions expected long term return on plan assets  and discount rate 
western union employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
consideration is given to diversification  re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held 
peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness 
we then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets 
the calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period 
our expected long term return on plan assets was for and the expected long term return on plan assets is for a basis point change in the assumed return for would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively 
the discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the plans to the rates from an aa spot rate yield curve 
the curve is derived from aa bonds of varying maturities 
the discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was and at december  and  respectively 
a basis point change in the discount rate would have an impact of less than million to our annual pension expense 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years borrowings  including interest a unrecognized tax benefits b purchase obligations c estimated pension funding d operating leases foreign currency derivative contracts e other f a we have estimated our interest payments based on i the assumption that no commercial paper borrowings will be outstanding beyond and ii the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes 
b the timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits  including accrued interest and penalties  is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control 
in  we are considering making a million refundable tax deposit relating to potential united states federal tax liabilities arising from our international restructuring 
by making the deposit  interest charges related to the amount of the deposit will cease 
to the extent the deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax liabilities  it is refundable 
table of contents with interest 
due to the uncertainty surrounding this tax deposit  the amount has not been reflected in the table above 
c many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a termination penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 
obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations 
d we have estimated our pension plan funding requirements  including interest  using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates 
the actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated 
in addition  we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million to the plans in  which has not been reflected in the table above 
e represents the liability position of our foreign currency derivative contracts as of december   which will fluctuate based on market conditions 
f this line item primarily includes the expected payment of million related to the agreement and settlement with the state of arizona  including amounts to be paid to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border  in which california  texas and new mexico will participate with arizona 
the table above excludes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the united states and mexico border and the engagement of a monitor of that program of approximately million to be incurred over the next two to four years also related to the agreement and settlement with the state of arizona due to the uncertainty over the timing of payments 
this balance also represents accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of december  other commercial commitments we had million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at december   with expiration dates through  certain of which contain a one year renewal option 
the letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements 
we expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances
