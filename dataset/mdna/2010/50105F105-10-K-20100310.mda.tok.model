item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
raw materials the primary raw materials used in chloride process tio are titanium containing feedstock natural rutile ore or purchased slag  chlorine and coke 
chlorine and coke are available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in australia  south africa  canada  india and the united states 
we purchase chloride process grade slag from rio tinto iron and titanium under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of we purchase natural rutile ore primarily from iluka resources  limited under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of we have in the past been  and expect in the future will continue to be  successful in obtaining long term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration 
we expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts to meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years 
the primary raw materials used in sulfate process tio are titanium containing feedstock  primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid 
sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in norway  canada  australia  india and south africa 
as one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process tio we own and operate rock ilmenite mines in norway  which provided all of the feedstock for our european sulfate process tio plants in we expect ilmenite production from our mines to meet our european sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future 
for our canadian sulfate process plant  we also purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from qit fer et titane inc a subsidiary of rio tinto iron and titanium  under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of and eramet titanium iron asa formerly tinfos titan and iron ks under a supply contract that expires in we expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next few years 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  although these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased 
the pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated annually 
the following table summarizes our raw materials purchased or mined in production process raw material raw materials procured or mined in thousands of metric tons chloride process plants purchased slag or natural rutile ore sulfate process plants raw ilmenite ore mined used internally purchased slag tio manufacturing joint venture we hold a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with huntsman corporation huntsman 
the joint venture owns and operates a chloride process tio facility located in lake charles  louisiana 
we share production from the plant equally with huntsman pursuant to separate offtake agreements 
a supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture  including production and output decisions 
this committee is composed of four members  two of whom we appoint and two of whom huntsman appoints 
two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee 
we appoint one general manager and huntsman appoints the other 
we are required to purchase one half of the tio produced by the joint venture 
the joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements  because we do not control it 
we account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method 
the joint venture operates on a break even basis and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture 
we share all costs and capital expenditures of the joint venture equally with huntsman with the exception of raw material and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced 
our share of the net costs is reported as cost of sales as the related tio is sold 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the tio industry is highly competitive 
our principal competitors are ei du pont de nemours co  millennium inorganic chemicals  inc a subsidiary of national titanium dioxide company ltd 
cristal  huntsman  tronox incorporated and sachtleben chemie 
these competitors have estimated individual shares of tio production capacity ranging from for sachtleben to for dupont and an estimated aggregate share of worldwide tio production volume of approximately 
dupont has over one half of total north american tio production capacity and is our principal north american competitor 
tronox filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in january  and has continued to operate as a debtor in possession since that date 
in december  tronox announced its intention to restructure and emerge from chapter it remains unclear how and to what extent tronox or a successor will compete in the tio industry at the conclusion of tronox s bankruptcy proceedings 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  product quality  technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades 
although certain tio grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigments with price being one of the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service 
we believe we are the leading seller of tio in several countries  including germany  with an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume in overall  we are the world s fourth largest producer of tio over the past ten years  we and our competitors have increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects 
although overall industry pigment demand is expected to be higher in as compared to as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions  we do not expect any significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our competitors to further increase capacity through such projects for the foreseeable future 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  ours and the tio industry s performance could be unfavorably affected 
worldwide capacity additions in the tio market resulting from construction of new plants require significant capital expenditures and substantial lead time typically three to five years in our experience 
we are not aware of any tio plants currently under construction and we believe it is not likely that any new plants will be constructed in europe or north america in the foreseeable future 
research and development our research and development activities are directed primarily at improving the chloride and sulfate production processes  improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new pigment applications 
our research and development activities are conducted at our leverkusen  germany facility 
our expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs were approximately million in each of  and we continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of customers and increase product life cycle 
since  we have added five new grades for plastics and coatings applications 
patents and trademarks we believe our patents held for products and production processes are important to us and our continuing business activities 
we seek patent protection for our technical developments  principally in the united states  canada and europe  and from time to time we enter into licensing arrangements with third parties 
our existing patents generally have terms of years from the date of filing and have remaining terms ranging from less than year to years 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights  including our patent rights  and from time to time are engaged in disputes relating to the protection and use of intellectual property relating to our products 
our trademarks  including kronos  are protected by registration in the united states and elsewhere with respect to those products we manufacture and sell 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology 
major customers we sell to a diverse customer base and no single customer made up more than of our sales for our largest ten customers accounted for approximately of sales in seasonality neither our business as a whole nor that of any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent 
however  tio sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year 
this is due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting season 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people europe canada united states total excludes employees of our louisiana joint venture 
our hourly employees in production facilities worldwide  including the tio joint venture  are represented by a variety of labor unions under labor agreements with various expiration dates 
our european union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements in the chemicals industry that are generally renewed annually 
our canadian union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in june regulatory and environmental matters our operations are governed by various environmental laws and regulations 
certain of our operations are  or have been  engaged in the handling  manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations 
as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage 
we have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks 
our policy is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all of our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance 
it is possible that future developments  such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies  could adversely affect our production  handling  use  storage  transportation  sale or disposal of such substances and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity 
our us manufacturing operations are governed by federal environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these primarily consist of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla  as well as the state counterparts of these statutes 
we believe the tio plant owned by the joint venture and a tio slurry facility owned by us in lake charles  louisiana are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of these laws or compliance orders issued thereunder 
these are our only us manufacturing facilities 
while the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in europe vary from country to country  a common regulatory framework is provided by the european union eu 
germany and belgium are members of the eu and follow its initiatives 
norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the eu 
we believe we have obtained all required permits and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements for our european and canadian facilities 
at our sulfate plant facilities in germany  we recycle weak sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities 
in addition  at our german locations we have a contract with a third party to treat certain sulfate process effluents 
at our norwegian plant  we ship spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent 
these contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice  depending on the contract 
from time to time  our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under us and us statutes 
typically we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters 
occasionally  we may pay penalties 
to date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we believe that all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in december  the eu approved registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach  which took effect on june  and will be phased in over years 
under reach  companies that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances in a central data base 
reach affects our european operations by imposing a testing  evaluation and registration program for many of the chemicals we use or produce in europe 
we have established a reach team that is working to identify and list all substances purchased  manufactured or imported by or for us in the eu 
we spent 
million in  
million in and 
million in on reach compliance and we do not anticipate that future compliance costs will be material to us 
capital expenditures in related to ongoing environmental compliance  protection and improvement programs were million and are currently expected to be approximately million in  including approximately million for a desulfurization unit at our belgian facility

item a 
risk factors below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
demand for  and prices of  certain of our products are influenced by changing market conditions and we are currently operating in a depressed worldwide market for our products  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
approximately of our revenues are attributable to sales of tio pricing within the global tio industry over the long term is cyclical and changes in economic conditions  especially in western industrialized nations  can significantly impact our earnings and operating cash flows 
the current world wide economic downturn depressed sales volumes in  principally in the first half of the year  and we are unable to predict with a high degree of certainty when demand will return to the levels experienced prior to the commencement of the downturn 
this may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand 
relative changes in the selling prices for our products are one of the main factors that affect the level of our profitability 
in periods of increasing demand  our selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase  while in periods of decreasing demand our selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease 
huntsman closed one of its european facilities and tronox closed its savannah  georgia facility in we believe further shutdowns or closures in the industry are possible 
the closures may not be sufficient to alleviate the current excess industry capacity and such conditions may be further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated capacity additions or other events 
the demand for tio during a given year is also subject to annual seasonal fluctuations 
tio sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year 
this is due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting season 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion on production and price changes 
we sell several of our products in mature and highly competitive industries and face price pressures in the markets in which we operate  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
the global markets in which we operate our business are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for our products or make it more difficult for us to compete with our competitors 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities so they could manufacture products that compete with our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
higher costs or limited availability of our raw materials may reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
the number of sources for and availability of  certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located 
for example  titanium containing feedstocks suitable for use in our tio facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability 
if our worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and we were unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels 
we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels  which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
negative global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 
we extend credit and payment terms to our customers 
although we have an ongoing process of evaluating customers financial condition  we could suffer significant losses if a customer fails and or is unable to pay 
a significant loss of an accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our leverage may impair our financial condition or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was approximately million  which relates to senior secured notes  a revolving credit facility of certain wholly owned subsidiaries of kronos international  inc and a revolving credit facility of our us subsidiary 
our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders and creditors  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our liabilities  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  requiring that a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  which reduces our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  dividends on our common stock  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors 
in addition to our indebtedness  we are party to various lease and other agreements pursuant to which  along with our indebtedness  we are committed to pay approximately million in our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures  depends on our future ability to generate cash flow 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds under our subsidiaries credit facilities in the future will  in some instances  depend in part on these subsidiaries ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement 
our business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when they become due and to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt in a timely manner on favorable terms  if at all  in the current credit markets 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we operate production facilities in several countries 
we believe all of our worldwide production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in many of the countries in which we operate  legislation has been passed  or proposed legislation is being considered  to limit greenhouse gases through various means  including emissions permits and or energy taxes 
in several of our production facilities  we consume large amounts of energy  including electricity and natural gas 
to date  the permit system in effect in the various countries in which we operate has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
however  if greenhouse gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries  it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production  particularly as it relates to our energy requirements 
if such increased costs of production were to materialize  we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for increased production costs  which may decrease our liquidity  operating income and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
for  approximately one half of our sales volumes were sold into european markets 
we believe we are the second largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes in in addition  we estimate that we have a share of north american tio sales volumes in our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product or gdp and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect that demand for tio will grow by to per year  consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gdp 
however  even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp  in part due to relative changes in the tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe our customers inventory levels are partly influenced by their expectation for future changes in market tio selling prices 
the majority of our tio grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products  we compete for sales primarily on the basis of price 
the factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are our tio sales and production volumes  tio selling prices  currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro  norwegian krone and the canadian dollar and manufacturing costs  particularly raw materials  maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
tio selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
in addition  our effective income tax rate in each of  and has been impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments 
executive summary we reported a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share for  compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share for our diluted earnings per share decreased from to due primarily to the net effects of i lower income loss from operations in resulting principally from lower sales and production volumes and ii an income tax benefit we recognized in in late  as a result of the sharp decline in global demand  we experienced a build up in our inventory levels 
in order to decrease our inventory levels and improve our liquidity  we implemented production curtailments during the first half of in addition  throughout all of we implemented cost controls and reduced our capital spending 
through these actions we successfully reduced our inventory and increased our liquidity  although the resulting curtailments led to a net loss in due to the large amount of unabsorbed fixed production costs we charged to expense as incurred 
we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share for  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share for our diluted earnings per share increased from to due primarily to the net effects of i an income tax benefit we recognized in  ii lower income from operations in resulting principally from lower sales volumes and higher raw material and energy costs and iii the unfavorable effect of certain provisions for income taxes recognized in net income for includes a million income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
net income for includes a million income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
net income for includes i a non cash charge of million per diluted share relating to a decrease in our net deferred income tax asset in germany resulting from the reduction of the german income tax rates  ii a non cash charge of million 
per diluted share related to the adjustment of certain german income tax attributes and iii a million income tax benefit 
per diluted share resulting from a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we currently expect improved results from operations in compared to primarily as a result of higher sales volumes  higher average selling prices and lower production costs as compared to we currently expect to report net income in as compared to reporting a net loss in due to higher expected income from operations in in addition  and as a consequence of a european court ruling that resulted in a favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany  during the first quarter of the german tax authorities agreed to an increase in our german net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  we expect to report a non cash income tax benefit of approximately million 
per diluted share in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets 
we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements of accounting standard codification asc topic property  plant and equipment and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in asc topic are present 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
benefit plans 
we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and opeb costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting in accordance with the recognition criteria of asc topic income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
at december   we have concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three year period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  particularly if the economic recovery were to be short lived or we were to generate losses in our german operations for an extended period of time  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic income taxes  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
it is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made 
in addition  we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non us subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us contingencies 
we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations is impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investments and long lived assets  defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals 
in addition  net income loss is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals

as a result of these market pressures our average tio prices in were lower than the prior year 
during the first half of  our average selling prices were generally declining  as we faced weak demand and excessive inventory levels 
beginning in mid  we and our competitors announced various price increases 
a portion of these price increase announcements were implemented during the third and fourth quarters of  and as a result our average selling price at the end of the second half of was higher than at the end of the first half of our decrease in sales volumes in is primarily due to lower sales volumes in europe and north america as a result of a global weakening of demand due to poor overall economic conditions  principally in the first half of cost of sales cost of sales decreased or million for  compared to  primarily due to the net impact of a decrease in sales volumes  lower raw material costs of million  a decrease in maintenance costs of million as part of our efforts to reduce operating costs where possible and currency fluctuations primarily the euro

million from million in to million in due to changes in currency exchange rates which offset the effect of increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and higher interest rates on our european credit facility 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax benefit our income tax benefit was million in compared to million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax benefit to our actual tax benefit 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of the resolution of tax audits in belgium and germany in the third and fourth quarters 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million relating to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards

tio selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
during the early part of  our average selling prices were generally flat 
during the second and third quarters of  we and our competitors announced various price increases and surcharges in response to higher operating costs 
a portion of these increase announcements were implemented during the second  third and fourth quarters of the positive impact of currency  product mix and pricing in were substantially offset by an decrease in sales volumes 
our decrease in sales volumes in is primarily due to lower sales volumes in all markets as a result of a global weakening of demand due to poor overall economic conditions 
cost of sales cost of sales increased or million for  compared to  due to the impact of a or approximately million increase in utility costs primarily energy costs  a or approximately million increase in raw material costs and currency fluctuations primarily the euro 
the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in the year ended december  compared to in the same period of primarily due to the net effects of higher operating costs and slightly higher average selling prices 
income from operations income from operations in declined by to million compared to  income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from for the decline in income from operations is driven by the decline in gross margin  which decreased to in compared to in while our average tio selling prices were higher in  our gross margin decreased primarily because of lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs  which more than offset the impact of higher sales prices 
changes in currency rates have also negatively affected our gross margin 
we estimate the negative effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased income from operations by approximately million when comparing to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately for and approximately for other non operating income and expense  net interest expense increased million from million for to million for due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to and increased borrowings in primarily under our european credit facility 
provision benefit for income taxes our benefit for income taxes was million in compared to an income tax provision of million for see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million relating to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
our income tax expense in includes a non cash charge of million relating to a decrease in our net deferred income tax asset in germany resulting from the reduction in its income tax rates  a non cash charge of million relating to the adjustment of certain german income tax attributes  and a non cash income tax benefit of million resulting from a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
effects of currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our sales from non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  we estimate that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income loss from operations for the periods indicated 
impact of changes in foreign currency vs transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change in millions impact on net sales income loss from operations impact of changes in foreign currency vs transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change in millions impact on net sales income loss from operations the positive impact on income loss from operations for the versus comparison is due to increased currency transaction gains in as compared to which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
the net impact on operations of changes in currency rates from to was not significant 
outlook in response to the worldwide economic slowdown and weak consumer confidence  we reduced our production volumes during in order to reduce our finished goods inventory  improve our liquidity and match production to market demand 
overall industry pigment demand is expected to be higher in as compared to as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions 
during  we and our competitors announced price increases  a portion of which were implemented during the second half of  with portions of the remainder expected to be implemented in as a result  the decline in our average selling prices we experienced during the first half of ceased  and our average selling prices increased during the second half of as a result of expected continued implementation of these and possible future price increases  we anticipate our average selling prices will continue to increase during we currently expect income from operations will be higher in as compared to  due to the favorable effects of higher tio sales volumes  average selling prices and production volumes 
higher production costs in resulted in part from the production curtailments we implemented in the first half of the year and the resulting unabsorbed fixed production costs 
while we operated our facilities at approximately of capacity during the first half of  we increased our capacity utilization to approximately during the second half of we believe our annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  and we currently expect to operate our facilities at approximately to of such capacity during our expected capacity utilization levels could be adjusted upwards or downwards to match changes in demand for our product 
overall  we expect to report net income in as compared to reporting a net loss in due to higher expected income from operations in as well as the impact of the million non cash income tax benefit we expect to recognize in the first quarter of  as discussed above 
our expectations as to the future of the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  solvency and continued operation of competitors  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following items lower income loss from operations in of million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  primarily due to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  and lower net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash requirements 
cash flows from operating activities decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was due primarily to the net effect of the following items lower income from operations in of million  higher net cash used by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  due primarily to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  lower cash paid for income taxes in of million  in part due to lower taxable income and the receipt of tax refunds at our european operating units  higher net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash flow  higher cash paid for interest in of million  as a result of increased borrowing and the effects of currency exchange rates on the semiannual interest payments on our senior secured notes  and higher depreciation expense of million in  primarily as a result of the effects of currency exchange rates 
changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
as shown below our average days sales outstanding dso decreased at december  compared to december  due to the timing of collections on receivable balances  and our average days sales in inventory dsi decreased at december  compared to december   as our tio sales volumes in exceeded our production volumes 
for comparative purposes  we have provided prior year numbers below

our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
we significantly lowered our capital expenditures in in response to the economic conditions and as part of our efforts to improve our liquidity

outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt was comprised of euro million principal amount of our senior secured notes million due in  euro million million under our european revolving credit facility which matures in may  million under our us revolving credit facility which matures in september  and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of the revolving credit facilities described above require the respective borrowers to maintain minimum levels of equity  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limit dividends and additional indebtedness and contain other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
in this regard  in the first half of we reduced our production levels in response to the current economic environment  which favorably impacted our liquidity and cash flows by reducing inventory levels 
the reduced capacity utilization levels negatively impacted our results of operations due to the resulting unabsorbed fixed production costs that are charged to expense as incurred 
furthermore  lower sales negatively impacted our results of operations in the first half of as a result  we did not expect to maintain compliance under our european revolving credit facility with the required financial ratio of the borrowers net secured debt to earnings before income taxes  interest and depreciation  as defined in the credit facility  for the month period ending march  beginning on march   the lenders associated with our european revolving credit facility agreed to a series of waivers for compliance with such required financial ratio 
on september  we and the lenders entered into the fourth amendment to the credit facility 
among other things  the fourth amendment added two additional financial covenants and increased the rate on outstanding borrowings to libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings 
upon achieving a specified financial covenant  these two additional financial covenants will no longer be in effect  and the interest rate on outstanding borrowings would be reduced to libor plus 
additionally the borrowing availability under the line is limited to euro million million at december  until we are in compliance with certain specified financial covenants  and in any event no earlier than march  we believe we will be able to comply with the new financial covenants through the maturity of the facility  however if future operating results differ materially from our expectations we may be unable to maintain compliance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended the terms of our canadian revolving credit facility to reduce the size of the facility from cdn 
million to cdn 
million and extend the maturity date to january see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries and our ability to service parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kronos international  inc kii has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interests of certain of kii s first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral for the senior secured notes 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes limits kii s ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments 
at december   the maximum amount of dividends and other restricted payments that kii could make the restricted payment basket was nil 
the indenture currently prohibits kii from utilizing the restricted payment basket because we have not met a specified financial ratio contained in this indenture  such prohibition will continue until such time as we meet the specified financial ratio 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had credit available under all of our existing credit facilities of approximately million  consisting principally of million under our european credit facility  million under our canadian credit facility and million under our us credit facility 
at december   we could borrow all such amounts without violating any covenants in such facilities 
based upon our expectation for the tio industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our future obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 
in this regard  see the discussion above in outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability 
the borrowing availability under our european revolving credit facility is currently limited to euro million million until we are in compliance with certain specified financial covenants  and in any event no earlier than march   and the million amount of our unused borrowing availability at december  is based on this euro million maximum borrowing availability 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
capital expenditures we intend to spend approximately million to maintain and improve our existing facilities during  including approximately million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
the majority of our expenditures in will be to maintain our facilities 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand or borrowing under existing credit facilities

debt and other contractual commitments as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes   and to our consolidated financial statements 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments in the table below are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments of ours and our consolidated subsidiaries as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payment due date contractual commitment and after total in millions indebtedness interest payments onindebtedness operating leases long term supply contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock long term service andother supply contracts fixed asset acquisitions estimated tax obligations a significant portion of the amount shown for indebtedness relates to our senior secured notes million at december  
such indebtedness is denominated in euro 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to the revolving credit facilities the amounts shown for indebtedness are based upon the actual amounts outstanding at december  the amounts shown for interest for any outstanding variable rate indebtedness is based upon the december  interest rates and assumes that such variable rate indebtedness remains outstanding until maturity 
our contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that we are required to purchase  although certain of these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased  generally no more than  based on our feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally based on a fixed price with price escalation clauses primarily based on consumer price indices  as defined in the respective contracts 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to the long term supply contracts for tio feedstock are based upon our current estimate of the quantity of material that will be purchased in each time period shown  the payment that would be due based upon such estimated purchased quantity and an estimate of the effect of the price escalation clause 
the actual amount of material purchased and the actual amount that would be payable by us  may vary from such estimated amounts 
our obligation for the purchase of tio feedstock is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements and above in business raw materials 
the amounts shown for the long term service and other supply contracts primarily pertain to agreements we have entered into with various providers of products or services which help to run our plant facilities electricity  natural gas  etc  utilizing december  exchange rates 
the amount shown for estimated tax obligations is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during the above table does not reflect any amounts we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans during such defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans are discussed below in greater detail 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
any amounts we might pay related to our asset retirement obligations as the terms and amounts of such future fundings are unknown  any amounts we might pay to settle any of our uncertain tax positions  as the timing and amount of any such future settlements are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the timing of tax audits 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements  and any amounts we might pay to acquire tio from our tio manufacturing joint venture  as the timing and amount of such purchases are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the amount of tio produced by the joint venture in the future and the joint venture s future cost of producing such tio however  the table does include amounts related to our share of the joint venture s ore requirements necessary to produce tio for us 
see item  business and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchase  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
under defined benefit pension plan accounting  defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
we recognize the full funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as either an asset for overfunded plans or a liability for underfunded plans in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pension adjustment in connection with the correction of our pension expense previously recognized for and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us and will generally differ from pension expense for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates  and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each december valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in europe and north america and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany canada norway us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan  the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year and an estimate of the amount of contributions to and distributions from the plan during the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive advice about appropriate long term rates of return from our third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
we expect the long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities  and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately   and  respectively 
in the us substantially all of the assets were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold c 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt and is a member of the cmrt investment committee 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices  while utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return has been 
our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each plan and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany canada norway us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables  which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial gain of approximately million 
this actuarial gain resulted primarily from the net effects of i the overall return on plan assets being in excess of the assumed return and ii the general reduction in discount rates from december  to december  based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of our plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans certain subsidiaries of ours in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under accounting for other postretirement employee benefits  opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
we recognize the full unfunded status of our opeb plans as a liability 
we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately 
million in each of and and 
million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated 
million in each of  and substantially all of our accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
due to continued increases in healthcare costs  it is expected that our opeb expense for financial reporting purposes will be consistent with the past two years 
our expected opeb benefit payments for are expected to be similar amounts 
the discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related opeb obligations are based on current interest rates earned on high quality bond yields in the applicable country where the benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates  and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the opeb obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of opeb expense for the following year 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately 
million of contributions to such plans during we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  a basis point change in assumed discount rates would have the following effects basis point increase basis point decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts we report for health care plans 
a one percent change in assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects increase decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation operations outside the united states as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone and united kingdom pound sterling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  the majority of our aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such non us dollar denominated indebtedness is presented in its non us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us dollars per euro 
certain norwegian krone denominated capital leases totaling million in have been excluded from the table below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated senior secured notes variable rate indebtedness us credit facility dollar denominated europe credit facility euro denominated at december   our euro denominated fixed rate indebtedness consisted solely of the senior secured notes  which aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at such date  our variable rate  euro denominated indebtedness consisted of our europe credit facility million with a weighted average interest rate of  and our variable rate  us dollar denominated indebtedness consisted of our us revolving credit facility million with a weighted average interest rate of and our revolving note with nl million with a weighted average interest rate of 
currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness at december  the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
at december   we had currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate euro million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per euro 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through december and are subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
at december   the actual exchange rate was kroner per euro 
the estimated fair value of such currency forward contracts at december  was a million net asset  which amount is recognized as part of prepaid expenses in our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding million currency transaction gain in our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent we held such contracts during  and  we did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a series of currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts with wachovia bank  national association mature from january through december and are subject to early redemption provisions at our option  and an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per us dollar 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from february through january and are subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
raw materials we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices relating to our raw materials 
as discussed in item we generally enter into long term supply agreements for certain of our raw material requirements including ore 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  although these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased 
raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated annually 
for certain raw material requirements we do not have long term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low  or because long term supply agreements for those raw materials are generally not available 
other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
