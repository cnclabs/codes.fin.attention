december  critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions questar s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions questar form k and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remediation costs 
the subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report for more information on the company s estimated proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages an independent reservoir engineering consultant to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the asset s carrying value 
the asset value is written down to estimated fair value  which is determined using discounted future net cash flows 
accounting for derivative contracts the company uses derivative contracts  typically fixed price swaps and costless collars  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income aoci depending on the structure of the derivative 
the company has historically structured substantially all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in asc derivatives and hedging 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in aoci or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
questar e p uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators 
a liability is recorded to the extent that questar e p has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
energy trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis 
energy trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions  nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices 
questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
questar form k the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer bills to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on non gas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
in  the pscu approved a three year pilot program for a conservation enabling tariff effective january   to promote energy conservation 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers

climate change risk federal and state courts and administrative agencies are considering the scope and scale of climate change regulation under various laws pertaining to the environment  energy use and development  and greenhouse gas emissions 
questar s ability to access and develop new natural gas reserves may be restricted by climate change regulation 
there are bills pending in congress that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances for offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases 
the epa has adopted final regulations for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gases emitted from certain large facilities  tons year of co 

equivalent beginning with operations in the first report is to be filed with the epa by march  in addition  several of the states in which questar operates are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs 
carbon dioxide regulation could i ncrease the price of natural gas  restrict access to or the use of natural gas  and or reduce natural gas demand 
federal  state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources  such as wind power and solar energy  which may reduce demand for natural gas 
while future climate change regulation is likely  it is too early to predict how this regulation will affect questar s business  operations or financial results 
it is uncertain whether questar s operations and properties  located in the rocky mountain and midcontinent regions of the united states  are exposed to possible physical risks  such as severe weather patterns  due to climate change as a result of man made greenhouse gases 
however  management does not believe that such physical risks are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
