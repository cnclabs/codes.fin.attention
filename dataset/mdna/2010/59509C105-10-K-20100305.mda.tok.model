item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a above under the caption risk factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
ongoing business activities we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer 
our product development pipeline includes novel antibodies generated with our proprietary bite antibody platform  as well as conventional monoclonal antibodies 
bite antibodies represent a new class of antibodies that activate the t cells of a patient s immune system to eliminate cancer cells 
t cells are considered the most powerful killer cells of the human immune system 
five of our antibodies are currently in clinical trials  while the remainder of our product pipeline is in preclinical development 
our lead product candidate is the bite antibody blinatumomab  also known as mt blinatumomab targets the human protein molecule cd  which is expressed on the surface of tumor cells of certain cancers 
blinatumomab has achieved the primary endpoint in a phase clinical trial evaluating blinatumomab as a treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or all 
based on the results of this trial  we intend to initiate a european pivotal clinical trial of blinatumomab in all patients in mid we are also evaluating blinatumomab in an ongoing phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
we are evaluating a second bite antibody  mt  in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors 
mt targets the epithelial cell adhesion molecule  or epcam  which is overexpressed in many solid tumors 
additional bite antibodies are at different stages of lead candidate selection and preclinical development 
we have entered into several strategic collaborations for the development of additional bite antibodies 
we are developing a bite antibody targeting carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea  for the treatment of solid tumors in collaboration with medimmune 
we have also entered into collaboration agreements with bayer schering pharma and sanofi aventis for the development of bite antibodies targeting other solid tumor targets 
our most advanced conventional monoclonal antibody is adecatumumab  also known as mt  which binds to epcam and is being developed under a collaboration with merck serono 
we are currently evaluating this antibody in a randomized phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with colorectal carcinoma after complete resection of liver metastases 
mt  a human antibody neutralizing the activity of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor  or gm csf  which has potential applications in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis  or multiple sclerosis  is under development in a phase clinical trial being conducted by our collaboration partner nycomed 
our monoclonal antibody mt  also known as trc  is licensed to tracon pharmaceuticals  inc and is being developed in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with cancer 
to date  we have incurred significant research and development expenses and have not achieved any revenues from sales of our product candidates 
each of our programs will require a number of years and significant costs to advance through development 
typically  it takes many years from the initial identification of a lead antibody target to the completion of preclinical and clinical trials  before applying for marketing approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  or the european medicines agency  or emea  or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries and regions 
the risk that a program has to be terminated  in part or in full  for safety reasons or lack of adequate efficacy is very high 
in particular  we cannot predict which  if any  product candidates can be successfully developed and for which marketing approval may be obtained  or the time and cost to complete development and receive marketing approvals 

table of contents as we obtain results from preclinical studies or clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue the development of one or more product candidates for safety  efficacy or commercial reasons 
we may also elect to discontinue or delay development of one or more product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates 
depending on the structure of such collaborative agreements  a third party may be granted control over the clinical trial process  manufacturing process or other key development process  for one of our product candidates 
in such a situation  the third party  rather than us  may in fact control development and commercialization decisions for the respective product candidate 
consistent with our business model  we may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future 
we cannot predict the terms of such agreements or their potential impact on our capital requirements 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner  or our failure to enter into new collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and affect our liquidity 
research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical development of blinatumomab  adecatumumab and mt  as well as development costs incurred for mt and mt  and research conducted with respect to our preclinical bite antibodies and the bite antibody platform generally 
this includes costs associated with clinical trials and manufacturing processes  quality systems and analytical development  compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  consultant fees and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we further develop our product candidates into more advanced stages of clinical development and increase our preclinical development for certain of our human antibodies and bite antibodies in cancer  anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be partly or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development or commercialization milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon our collaborations 
we also may retain co promotion rights in certain of our agreements 
through march  we developed blinatumomab in collaboration with medimmune under an agreement signed in  which we refer to in this report as the agreement 
under the agreement  medimmune reimbursed a portion of our clinical development costs in our european clinical trials 
in november  we entered into a termination agreement  which we refer to as the agreement  under which we acquired medimmune s remaining option right to commercialize blinatumomab in north america 
the agreement terminates the agreement  under which medimmune had been granted the right to develop and commercialize blinatumomab and other bite antibodies binding to antigens relevant for hematological cancers in north america 
as a result of the agreement  we now control the rights to develop and commercialize blinatumomab in all territories  as well as any other bite antibodies binding to antigens relevant for hematological cancers that had been licensed to medimmune under the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  medimmune has sold to us the remaining stock of blinatumomab clinical trial material and will transfer the manufacturing process for this product candidate to us or our contract manufacturer 
in return  we will make an upfront payment of million in installments through december  of which we have paid million to date 
in addition  medimmune is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of million from us based upon the achievement of specified strategic and regulatory milestone events relating to blinatumomab in north america and a low single digit royalty based on net sales of blinatumomab in north america 
a second agreement with medimmune under which we are collaborating with medimmune on the development of mt provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on future sales of mt the potential milestone payments are subject to the successful completion of clinical development and obtaining marketing approval in one or more national markets 

table of contents in october  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi aventis under which the two companies will collaborate on the development of a new bite antibody targeting solid tumors 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be responsible for generating and developing the bite antibody through the completion of phase clinical trials  at which point sanofi aventis will assume full control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate on a worldwide basis 
we received an upfront payment of million  or million as of the date of the agreement  and are eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of development milestones of up to million  or million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  and sales milestones of up to million  or million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  and up to a low double digit royalty on worldwide net sales of the product 
in addition  sanofi aventis will bear the cost of development activities and will reimburse us for our expenses incurred in connection with the development program 
a portion of the upfront payment in the amount of million  or million as of the date of the agreement  is related to the reimbursement of ftes allocated by us to the performance of the development program 
in january  we entered into an option  collaboration and license agreement with bayer schering pharma ag under which we granted bayer schering pharma an exclusive option to obtain a license to one of our preclinical bite antibodies against an undisclosed oncology target for an upfront fee of million  or approximately million as of the date of the agreement 
in december  bayer schering pharma exercised the option and paid us the exercise fee of million  or approximately million as of the date of the agreement  in january we have now initiated a collaboration on the development of the bite antibody through the completion of phase clinical trials  at which point bayer schering pharma will assume full control of the further development and commercialization of the bite antibody 
in addition to the payment of the initial option fee and the option exercise fee  we will be eligible to receive total development and sales milestone payments of million  or approximately million as of the date of the agreement  and up to double digit royalties based on tiered net sales of the product to be developed under the agreement 
in addition  bayer schering pharma will reimburse us for our research and development expenses incurred in connection with the development program 
under our collaboration agreement with merck serono  we have received million in up front and milestone payments from merck serono to date  not including reimbursements for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of adecatumumab 
the agreement provides for potential future clinical development milestone payments of up to an additional million 
we have all decision making authority and operational responsibility for the clinical trials of adecatumumab that we conduct  including the phase clinical trial that we initiated in the first half of merck serono will bear the development expenses associated with the collaboration in accordance with the agreed upon budget and a specified maximum 
we intend to pursue additional collaborations to provide resources for further development of our product candidates and may grant technology access licenses 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements  and if we do  on what terms we might do so 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and advance these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  the likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as relevant commercial factors 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition our revenues generally consist of licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and fees for research services earned from license agreements or from research and development collaboration agreements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  upon the satisfaction of the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the expected life of the development period and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
milestone payments are derived from the achievement of predetermined goals under the collaboration agreements 
for milestones that are subject to contingencies  the related contingent revenue is not recognized until the milestone has been reached and customer acceptance has been obtained as necessary 
fees for research and development services performed under the agreements are generally stated at a yearly fixed fee per research scientist 
we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we have received initial license fees and annual renewal fees upfront each year under license agreements 
revenue is recognized when the above noted criteria are satisfied unless we have further obligations associated with the license granted 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sale of products under license and collaboration agreements 
royalties are based upon the volume of products sold and are recognized as revenue upon notification of sales from the customer 
through december   we have not received or recognized any royalty payments 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asc topic provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is allocated to the separated units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue on development and collaboration agreements  including upfront payments  where they are considered combined units of accounting  over the expected life of the development period and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
a reporting unit is an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  the development of biopharmaceutical products 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulatory authority  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
since we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  we 
table of contents calculate fair value as our total market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
as a result of the merger between micromet ag and cancervax in  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with asc topic and determined that the carrying amount of this goodwill was recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
patents our patent portfolio consists primarily of internally developed patents covering our bite antibody platform and the composition of our bite antibody product candidates and conventional antibodies 
the costs of generating our internally developed patent portfolio has been expensed as incurred 
we also acquired patents in covering single chain antibody technology 
these purchased patents are being amortized over their estimated useful lives through using the straight line method 
these patents are utilized in revenue producing activities through license agreements 
evidence from recent licensing transactions indicated that our future licensing fees derived from these purchased patents will be lower than previously expected 
we deemed these events in connection with lower expectations of future licensing fees to be an indication of potential impairment 
we periodically assessed whether the carrying value of the purchased patents was recoverable 
we evaluated whether the carrying value of the patents would be recoverable by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows generated from these patents 
the carrying value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows  therefore  we estimated the fair value of the patents to determine the amount of impairment 
we estimated the fair value of the patents using the income approach discounted cash flows 
based on the fair value  we recognized a non cash patent impairment charge of approximately million during the year ended december  the impairment charge was recorded within research and development expenses on the statement of operations 
key inputs utilized in the determination of this non recurring fair value measurement related to our estimates of cash flows for the remaining patent life and the discount rate factor 
the determination of the discount rate was based upon the risk free rate  adjusted by a risk premium 
impairment of long lived and identifiable intangible assets the evaluation for impairment of long lived and intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgment by management 
subsequent to the initial recording of long lived and intangible assets  we must test such assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
when we conduct our impairment tests  factors that are important in determining whether impairment might exist include assumptions regarding our underlying business and product candidates and other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in impairment 
such impairment charge  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awards on the grant date in accordance with asc topic  share based payment  using the black scholes option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividend yield is projected at  as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies 
the expected term of at the money options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term 
asc topic also requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate for the year ended december  was based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom the options were granted 

table of contents performance based stock options vest upon the attainment of specific performance targets 
the measurement date of stock options containing performance based vesting is the date the stock option grant is authorized and the specific performance goals are communicated 
compensation expense is recognized based on the probability that the performance criteria will be met 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based vesting requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the continued assessment of probability may result in additional expense recognition or expense reversal depending on the level of achievement of the performance goals 
common stock warrants liability in accordance with asc topic  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we classify warrants as liabilities when the potential for a net cash settlement to the holders of the warrants exists  even if remote 
asc topic also requires that the warrants be revalued at the end of each reporting period as our warrants are considered to be derivative instruments 
we adjust the instruments to their current fair value using the black scholes option pricing model formula at each reporting period end  with any resulting change in value recorded in the statement of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenues 
collaborative research and development revenue consists of reimbursements for full time equivalents and pass through expenses we incur under each collaborative agreement as described in detail below 
license and other revenue consists primarily of revenues from licenses of patents relating to single chain antibody technology  for which we serve as the exclusive marketing partner under a marketing agreement with enzon pharmaceuticals  inc the following table summarizes our revenue for the periods presented in millions

years ended december  research and development revenue by collaborator nycomed bayer schering merck serono medimmune sanofi aventis tracon other total collaborative research and development revenue license and other revenue total revenues nycomed 
collaborative research and development revenue from nycomed reflects nycomed s full cost responsibility for the mt product development program 
the nycomed revenue represents the reimbursement of our preclinical development activities  including reimbursement for full time equivalents  as well as million in revenue representing the amortized portion of the million up front payment that we received from nycomed in this up front payment is being recognized on a straight line basis over a year period ending in the decrease in overall nycomed revenue of million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due primarily to our lower level of activity during  as nycomed assumed primary responsibility for the development of mt and initiated a phase clinical trial of this product candidate during the year  partially offset by a million milestone payment received during the increase of million for over reflects the fact that full early stage 
table of contents clinical activities  for which we had primary responsibility  did not begin until the fourth quarter of we expect our nycomed revenue to decline further in as nycomed continues to perform later stage development work 
bayer schering pharma 
collaborative revenue from bayer schering pharma represents the receipt of approximately million in january upon the grant of an option to collaborate with us regarding the development of a new bite antibody 
this option fee was fully recognized into revenue during the year ended december  bayer schering pharma exercised the option and paid us approximately million in january we will recognize this million payment into revenue on a straight line basis over months  the period during which we expect to participate on the joint steering committee under our collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma 
in addition  we will recognize revenue related to our development efforts under this agreement  including reimbursement of development expenses 
therefore  we expect an increase in revenues under this agreement for as compared to sanofi aventis 
we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi aventis in the fourth quarter of upon execution of the agreement  we received an upfront payment of approximately million 
the upfront fee is being recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over months  the period during which we expect to participate on the joint steering committee under the collaboration agreement 
we also receive reimbursement of our development expenses under the program  which accounted for million of revenue in as this collaboration was in place for only the last two months of  we expect an increase in revenues under this agreement for as compared to medimmune 
collaborative research and development revenue from medimmune represents reimbursements for our costs incurred in the development of blinatumomab and mt as described elsewhere in this report  medimmune ended its participation in the development of blinatumomab in march  and we terminated our collaboration with medimmune for the development of blinatumomab in the fourth quarter of as a result  the revenues in decreased to million from million in  and there will be no further collaborative research and development revenue for blinatumomab in the future 
for as compared to  collaborative revenue under the blinatumomab increased by million due to increases in the levels of activity performed 
our other collaboration with medimmune for our mt product candidate continues in full effect  although there was a million decrease in revenues under this program for  as compared to  due to the transition of the later stage work to medimmune 
revenues under this development program were consistent for as compared to during we also recognized million in revenue from medimmune under a development program targeting the epha antigen  but we discontinued this collaboration in we expect collaborative revenue from medimmune for mt to remain at approximately the same level as in merck serono 
collaborative research and development revenue from merck serono reflect merck serono s full responsibility for the costs for the development of the mt program 
revenues during were consistent with those recognized during  as the product candidate continues to be evaluated in two separate clinical trials 
in  we amended our collaboration with merck serono  which extended the period over which revenue is to be recognized for the phase study of mt in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
the period was extended from june to june  which had the effect of reducing the amount of revenue for as compared to we expect collaborative revenues under this program to be generally consistent with those of tracon 
collaborative research and development revenue from tracon reflects tracon s full responsibility for the costs of the mt product development program 
revenue under this agreement consists of expense reimbursements and revenue from an upfront payment of million received from tracon in that is being recognized on a straight line basis over a year period ending in during  we also recognized revenue of approximately million from tracon upon delivery of our stock of clinical trial materials 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for 
table of contents personnel  outside service costs including production of clinical material  fees for services in the context of clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we incur process development expenses mainly for production of gmp grade clinical trial material  as well as fermentation  purification and formulation development 
preclinical development expenses cover pharmacological in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as development of analytical testing procedures 
except for payments made in advance of services rendered  we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million for the year ended december  over was partially the result of million in expenses incurred in connection with the termination of our blinatumomab collaboration  consisting of our million initial payment to medimmune  our purchase of the clinical trial inventory of blinatumomab for million  a cost of million to transfer the blinatumomab manufacturing process to our contract manufacturer and regulatory related expenses of million 
for  we also accrued million of expense for the settlement of our arbitration with curis  inc  which occurred in february  as well as a patent impairment charge of million relating to the single chain antibody patents that had been purchased from curis in we also incurred a million increase in stock based compensation for over  which was primarily the result of accelerated vesting of stock options from the separation of our chief medical officer  as well as the vesting of performance based stock options during partially offsetting these increases over was a reduction in mt expenses of million during  due to the shift in program responsibilities to nycomed for the later stage development work  which also had the effect of reducing collaborative revenue from this program during the increase of million in research and development expense for the year ended december  over resulted from increases in manufacturing expenses of million and preclinical services of million  in each case primarily under our mt program 
there were also increases in clinical expenses of million under our blinatumomab program and million under our mt program and an overall increase in research and development personnel expenses of million  primarily due to headcount increases 
since  we have tracked our external research and development expenses by major project candidate development program  such as for blinatumomab  mt  adecatumumab and mt  or we allocate the expenses to our bite antibody platform generally 
we do not allocate salary and overhead costs or stock based compensation expense to specific research and development projects or product candidates 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and cumulatively since are summarized in the table below in thousands

years ended december  cumulative blinatumomab     mt     adecatumumab     mt     bite antibody platform and other    unallocated salary and overhead    share based compensation     total     we expect significant increases in research and development expenses going forward as we initiate later stage trials of blinatumomab 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include allocated facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal and audit services 

table of contents general and administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million for the year ended december  over resulted from increased stock based compensation charges of million for vesting of performance based stock option grants  overall increases of million in salaries  million for investor relations expenses and million for professional fees 
the increase of million for as compared was the result of increases of million for professional fees and million for depreciation charges related to leasehold improvements made for the sublease of our munich facility  offset by a one time adjustment of million in to increase our lease exit liability for our former corporate headquarters 
change in fair value of common stock warrants liability 
on june   we issued warrants to purchase our common stock that provide that if we are merged or consolidated with or into another company  we sell all or substantially all of our assets in one or a series of related transactions  any tender offer or exchange offer is completed pursuant to which holders of our common stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities  cash or property  or we effect any reclassification of our common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities  cash or property  then we or any successor entity are obligated to purchase each unexercised warrant for a cash amount equal to its fair value computed using the black scholes option pricing model with prescribed guidelines 
as a consequence of these provisions  the warrants are classified as a liability on our balance sheet  and changes in our stock price cause the fair value of the warrants to change each reporting period  with these changes being reflected in the statement of operations 
increases in our stock price cause the warrant liability to increase  and this increase is charged to expense  while decreases in our stock price cause the liability to decrease  which is recorded as a reduction to other income 
our stock price decreased from per share on june   the date of issuance  to per share on december   resulting in other income of million for the year 
our stock price then increased to per share on december  and per share on december   resulting in incremental expense of million and million for and  respectively 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased from million in to million in and then to million in the decreases in each case were the result of lower average interest rates on invested cash balances 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in but then increased slightly to million in in july we repaid in full our silent partnership debt  which accounted for the decrease from to in  we repaid in full our obligations under a note to medimmune that was scheduled to mature in the increase in as compared to was also due to the amortization of premiums on our investments 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net includes foreign currency transaction gains losses and miscellaneous other items 
the increase in expense of million for the period ending december  over resulted from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the decrease in other income for the year ending december  from was due to a release of million in connection with the return to a third party of technology rights and a million refund of withholding taxes from german tax authorities 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows we had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we closed a public offering of our common stock in the third quarter of that yielded net proceeds to us of million  and we also received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock under our committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital in the second quarter of net cash used in operating activities was million for  million for  and million for in each case the majority of the cash used was to fund our ongoing research and development efforts that resulted in net losses of million  million and million  respectively  during these years 
our net losses for these years were adjusted by million  million and million  respectively  of net non cash expenses  including the changes in fair value of warrant liability described above 

table of contents working capital changes resulted in net cash inflows of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
as described elsewhere in this report  we received an upfront cash payment of million from sanofi aventis during and upfront cash payments of million from nycomed and million from tracon during  each of which resulted in deferred revenues that are being recognized as revenue over an extended period 
for  other significant working capital changes included a net decrease of million in accounts receivable from collections and a net increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at the end of  we had accrued approximately million to be paid to medimmune in connection with the termination of our blinatumomab collaboration  of which the first installment of was paid in january we had also accrued million in connection with our settlement with curis  inc  which was resolved and paid in february for  significant working capital changes included net cash inflows from collections of accounts receivable of million and net outflows from a decrease in prepaid expenses of million 
for  other significant working capital changes included net cash outflows from decreases in accounts payable of million and increases in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for was the result of the net purchase of short term investments of million and equipment purchases of million for computer servers and research equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the decrease from to was due to lower investments in property and equipment during the capital expenditures related primarily to leasehold improvements undertaken in conjunction with the sublease of our munich facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for as described above  we received million in net proceeds from our public offering and the ceff with kingsbridge 
we also received million from the exercise of stock options and used million to repay in full our debt under a promissory note to medimmune 
during  the net cash provided by financing activities of million included a private placement of common stock and warrants that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million and stock option and warrant exercises of million  offset by payments of million for the repayment of our silent partnership debt 
during  the net cash provided by financing activities of million included a private placement of common stock and warrants that resulted in net proceeds of million  offset by million in debt obligations 
sources and uses of cash we have funded our recent operations through proceeds from public offerings and private placements of preferred stock  common stock and associated warrants and equity draws under the ceff with kingsbridge  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and licensing and milestone payments related to our product candidate partnering activities 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years 
if appropriate  we may raise substantial funds through the sale of our common stock or debt securities or through establishing additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our capital resources as of the date of this report  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into late  without considering any potential future milestone payments that we may receive under our current or any new collaborations we may enter into in the future  any future capital raising transactions or any additional draw downs from our ceff with kingsbridge 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock  it could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we were to raise additional funds through additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations  as well as covenants and financial ratios that could restrict our ability to operate our business 
having insufficient funds could require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish some or all of our rights to our product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
if we raise funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some 
table of contents of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
failure to obtain adequate financing may also adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate as a going concern 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors in this report 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of our capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any corporate collaborations that we may establish  and the success of these collaborations  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales  and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of preparing for  defending against and the ultimate resolution of litigation or other claims brought against us  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
committed equity financing facility 
on december   we entered into the ceff with kingsbridge pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to million of our common stock through december the facility is subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
in connection with this ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable until june under the ceff  the maximum number of shares that we may sell to kingsbridge is  shares  exclusive of the shares underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
subject to specified conditions and limitations  from time to time under the ceff  we may require kingsbridge to purchase shares of our common stock at a price that is between and of the volume weighted average price on each trading day during an eight day pricing period  provided that if the average market price on any day during the pricing period is less than the greater of or of the closing price of the day preceding the first day of the pricing period  then that day would not be used in determining the number of shares that would be issued in the draw down and the aggregate amount of the draw down would be decreased by one eighth 
the maximum dollar amount of shares that we may require kingsbridge to purchase in any pricing period is equal to the greater of a a percentage of our market capitalization as determined at the time of the draw down  which percentage ranges from to depending upon our market capitalization at the time of the draw down  or b four times the average trading volume of our common stock for a specified period prior to the draw down notice  multiplied by the closing price of the common stock on the trading day prior to the draw down notice  in each case subject to specified conditions 
if either of the foregoing calculations yields a draw down amount in excess of million  then the individual draw down amount is limited to million 
we filed a registration statement which became effective in december with respect to the resale of shares issuable under the ceff and underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge  and the registration rights agreement requires us to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement 
if we fail to maintain the 
table of contents effectiveness of the registration statement  or if we suspend the use of the registration statement  then under certain circumstances we may be required to pay certain amounts to kingsbridge  or issue to kingsbridge additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash payment  in each case as liquidated damages 
we are not obligated to sell any of the million of common stock available under the ceff and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties 
the ceff does not contain any restrictions on our operating activities  automatic pricing resets or minimum market volume restrictions 
during the second quarter of we made our only draw downs to date under the ceff 
we issued a total of  shares of common stock to kingsbridge for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the remaining amount available under the ceff has decreased to the lesser of million or  shares of common stock 
public offering of common stock 
on august   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriters discount and offering expenses paid by us

payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases    contractual payments under licensing and research and development agreements capital leases we are a party to technology transfer  licensing and research and development agreements with various universities  research organizations and other third parties under which we have received licenses to certain intellectual property  scientific know how and technology 
in consideration for the licenses received  we are required to pay license and research support fees  milestone payments upon the achievement of certain success based objectives and  in some cases  royalties on future sales of commercialized products  if any 
we may also be required to pay minimum annual royalties and the costs associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents covering the licensed technology 
due to the uncertainty as to when  how much or if these payments will be made  they are not included in the table above 
also not shown in the above table are amounts owed under the medimmune termination and curis settlement as they are already recorded in our accounts payable or accrued expenses 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in april  the fasb issued several pronouncements related to fair value measurement  recording and disclosure in financial reporting 
fasb asc topic financial instruments and asc topic  interim reporting  were issued to outline the required financial statement disclosures relating to fair value of financial instruments during interim reporting periods 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  was issued to provide additional guidance in evaluating the fair value of a financial instrument when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased 
fasb asc topic  recognition investments debt equity securities  was issued to provide additional guidance on presenting impairment losses on securities 
all of the fair value measurement pronouncements were effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of these new pronouncements did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued asc topic  subsequent events 
asc is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for selecting that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
asc topic is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  the adoption of asc topic did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of sfas no 
the fasb accounting standards codification asc will become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date of this statement  the asc superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the asc will become nonauthoritative 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb approved asc topic  arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this statement provides principles for allocation of consideration among multiple elements  allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement 
asc topic introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available  and significantly expands related disclosure requirements 
asc topic is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  alternatively  adoption may be on a retrospective basis  and early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements  with respect to non financial assets and liabilities effective january  this pronouncement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption of asc topic did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements any statements in this report about our expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include statements regarding our available cash resources  our expectations regarding future revenue and expense levels  the efficacy  safety and intended utilization of our product candidates  the development of our clinical stage product candidates and our bite antibody technology  the future development of blinatumomab by us  the conduct  timing and results of future clinical trials  plans regarding regulatory filings  our ability to draw down under the ceff and the availability of financing  and our plans regarding partnering activities 
you can identify these forward looking statements by the use of words or phrases such as believe  may  could  will  possible  can  estimate  continue  ongoing  consider  anticipate  intend  seek  plan  project  expect  should  would  or assume or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology  although not all forward looking statements contain these words 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements are risks and uncertainties inherent in our business including  without limitation  the progress  timing or success of our clinical trials  difficulties or delays in development  testing  obtaining regulatory approval for producing and marketing our product candidates  regulatory developments in the united states or in foreign countries  the risks associated with our reliance on collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  unexpected adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy of our product candidates that could delay or prevent product development or commercialization  or that could result in recalls or product liability claims  our ability to attract and retain key scientific  management or commercial personnel  the loss of key scientific  management or commercial personnel  the 
table of contents size and growth potential of the potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets  the scope and validity of patent protection for our product candidates  competition from other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations or to otherwise obtain additional financing to support our operations on commercially reasonable terms  successful administration of our business and financial reporting capabilities  and other risks detailed in this report  including those above in item a  risk factors 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  events  levels of activity  performance or achievement 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  unless required by law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us and foreign government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rates a majority of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are denominated in us dollars  however  a significant percentage is denominated in euros 
because the us dollar is our reporting currency  these euro balances are translated into dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each financial reporting period 
a majority of our operating expenses  including our research and development expenses  are incurred in europe pursuant to arrangements that are generally denominated in euros 
for financial reporting purposes  expenses incurred in euros are translated into u 
s dollars at the average exchange rate in effect during the period 
as a result  our financial results and capital resources are affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
as of december   we had us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents of million and euro denominated cash and investments of million  or approximately million using the exchange rate as of that date 
as of december   we had euro denominated liabilities of approximately million  or approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an increase in our reported operating expenses due to the translation of the euro denominated expenses into us dollars  and such changes would negatively impact the length of time that our existing capital resources would be sufficient to finance our operations 
we partially hedge euro denominated expenses budgeted over the next twelve months by maintaining an equivalent portfolio of euro denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  several of our current collaboration agreements provide for our collaborators to reimburse us in euros for our development expenses incurred under those collaborations 
these collaboration agreements also provide for milestone payments to be paid in euros  which also hedges against currency fluctuations associated with our future euro denominated operating expenses and obligations
