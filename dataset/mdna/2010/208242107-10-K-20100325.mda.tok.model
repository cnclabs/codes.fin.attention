general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of our financial condition and performance in the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 
through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in seven primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast and south texas and oklahoma 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  repair service agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account programs  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedu res and methods in managing their operations 
our management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of the retail stores and considers the credit programs  repair service contracts and distribution system to be an integral part of our retail operations 
presented below is a diagram setting forth our five cornerstones which represent  in our view  the five components of our sales goal strong merchandising systems  flexible credit options for our customers  an extensive warehousing and distribution system  a service system to support our customer s needs during and beyond the product warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
each of these systems is discussed at length in the business section of this report 
we derive the majority of our revenues from our product and repair service agreement sales 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through these programs 
in turn  we finance substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through a revolving credit facility and an asset backed securitization facility 
see business finance operations for a detailed discussion of our in house credit programs and our sources of funding 
as part of our asset backed securitization facility  we have created a qualifying special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes secured by the receivables to finance its acquisition of the receivables 
we transfer eligible receivables  consisting of retail installment and revolving account receivables extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated securities 
customer receivables funded by our revolving credit facility are retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to the products they have purchased  to the extent they do not already have it 
executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the prior year is included beginning under results of operations 
our performance during fiscal was impacted by the slowdown in the economy and rising unemployment in our markets that occurred during the year 
following are significant financial items in management s view our revenues for the fiscal year ended january   decreased by  or million  from fiscal year  to million due primarily to a decline in product sales and related reduction in repair service agreement commissions 
sales declined during the year largely as a result of the slowdown in the economic conditions in our markets  reduced average selling prices for televisions and were also impacted by tighter credit underwriting standards implemented during the year to improve the credit quality of our consumer receivable portfolio 
the decline in our total revenues was partially offset by a non cash increase in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets  which totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million decrease in fiscal our same store sales declined in the fiscal year ended january   as compared to an increase of for fiscal the addition of stores in our existing dallas fort worth  houston  southeast and south texas markets and the opening of three stores in oklahoma in fiscal had a positive impact on our revenues 
we achieved approximately million of increases in product sales and repair service agreement sma commissions for the year ended january   from the opening of nine new stores in these markets since february while we have no current plans to open additional stores  we have additional sites under consideration for future development and continue to evaluate our store opening plans for future periods  provided we have adequate capital availability 
deferred interest and same as cash plans continue to be an important part of our sales promotion plans and are utilized to provide a wide variety of financing to enable us to appeal to a broader customer base 
for the fiscal year ended january   million  or  of our product sales were financed by deferred interest and same as cash plans 
we have been able to reduce the volume of promotional credit as a percent of product sales  as compared to the prior year 
for the comparable period in the prior year  product sales financed by deferred interest and same as cash sales were million  or 
our promotional credit programs same as cash and deferred interest programs  which require monthly payments  are reserved for our highest credit quality customers  thereby reducing t he overall risk in the portfolio  and are used primarily to finance sales of our highest margin products 
we expect to continue to offer extended term promotional credit in the future 
during the fiscal year ended january   we began offering promotional credit programs through third party consumer credit programs  which financed million of our product and repair service agreement sales during the year 
our gross margin was for fiscal  an increase from in fiscal  primarily as a result of o a million increase in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets in fiscal  as compared to the million reduction in the prior year  which positively impacted the total gross margin by basis points  o reduced gross margin realized on product sales from in the year ended january   to in fiscal year  which negatively impacted the total gross margin by basis points 
the product gross margins were negatively impacted by a highly price competitive retail market and our successful strategy early in the fiscal year to grow market share  and o a change in the revenue mix in the year ended january   such that higher gross margin finance charge and other revenues contributed a larger percentage of total revenues  excluding the non cash fair value adjustment  partially offset by reduced revenue contribution from repair service agreement commissions  which contributed a smaller percentage of total revenues  and resulted in an increase in the total gross margin of approximately basis points 
finance charges and other increased for the fiscal year ended january   when compared to the same period last year  primarily due to a growth in interest income earned on customer receivables retained on the balance sheet 
as a result of the increase in the balance of receivables retained on our balance sheet  interest income and fees increased to million for the twelve months ended january   from million in the prior year period  partially offset by a decrease in securitization income resulting from the reduction in the volume of receivables sold to the qspe  and reduced insurance commission income 
during the fiscal year ended january   selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased as a percent of revenues to from in the prior year period  primarily due to the litigation reserves we established to reflect our best estimate of the amount we expect will be required to settle outstanding litigation as well as the increase in expenses related to the new stores opened during the prior fiscal year and the general de leveraging effect of the decline in same store sales 
partially offsetting the increase was the positive impact of the fair value adjustments related to our interests in securitized assets on total revenues  which accounted for approximately basis points of decrease in the twelve month period 
during the fiscal year ended january   we determined  as a result of the sustained decline in our market capitalization  the increasingly challenging economic environment and its impact on our comparable store sales  credit portfolio performance and operating results  that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary 
a two step method was utilized for determining goodwill impairment 
our valuation was performed utilizing the services of outside valuation consultants using both an income approach utilizing our discounted debt free cash flows and comparable valuation multiples 
upon completion of the impairment test  we concluded that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to write off the carrying value of our goodwill during the three month period ended october  the provision for bad debts increased to million in fiscal  from million in the prior year 
this increase is due to an increase in the balance of customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet  as expected  after the completion of our asset based revolving credit facility in august  and higher actual net credit charge offs on the retained receivables as a result of the increased balances over the past months 
additionally  as a result of the recent credit portfolio performance and expectations about future net charge offs  the bad debt and uncollectible interest reserves for receivables retained on our balance sheet were increased  as a percent of the customer receivable balance  to at january   from at january  as opposed to our interests in the customer receivables transferred to the qspe  which we account for at fair value  we are required to record a reserve for estimated future net credit losses for receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet  which we estimate based on our historical and projected loss trends 
net interest expense increased in fiscal  due primarily to the increase in customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result  we have used previously invested cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the growth in customer receivables retained 
the provision for income taxes was negatively impacted by the effect of the taxes for the state of texas  which are based on gross margin  instead of income before taxes 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued to focus on  or modified operating initiatives that we believe will positively impact future results  including increased emphasis on sales of furniture and mattresses by enhancing our product offerings and displays  increased emphasis on improving gross margin  and adjusted credit underwriting guidelines to improve the credit quality and profitability of our in house credit programs 
during the year  we opened one new store in the houston market and one in the dallas fort worth market and closed two of our clearance centers  one in the houston market and one in the san antonio market 
we have additional areas under consideration for future store locations and continue to evaluate our store opening plans for future periods  provided we have adequate capital availability 
in order to improve the credit quality of our credit portfolio and reduce the amount of capital used in our credit operations  we reduced the amount of credit granted as a percentage of sales during the past fiscal year 
additionally  as a result of these changes  we have seen the mix between the primary and secondary receivables portfolios shift to a greater proportion of the receivables being in the higher quality primary portfolio 
while we benefited from our operations being concentrated in the texas  louisiana and oklahoma region in the earlier months of  turmoil in the national economy  including instability in the financial markets  declining consumer confidence and falling oil prices have and will present significant challenges to our operations 
specifically  future sales volumes  gross profit margins and credit portfolio performance could be negatively impacted  and thus impact our overall results of operations and liquidity 
additionally  declines in our future operating performance could impact compliance with our credit facility covenants  which we recently renegotiated to avoid potentially triggering the default provisions of our credit facilities 
as a result  while we will strive to maintain our market share  improve credit portfolio performanc e and reduce expenses  we will also work to maintain our access to the liquidity necessary to maintain our operations through these challenging times 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentat ion of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as of january transfers of financial assets 
we transfer eligible customer receivables to a qspe that issues asset backed securities to third party lenders using these accounts as collateral  and we continue to service these accounts after the transfer 
we recognize the sale of these accounts when we relinquish control of the transferred financial asset 
as we transfer the accounts we record an asset representing the fair value of our interest in the cash flows of the qspe  which is the difference between the interest earned on customer accounts and the cost associated with financing and servicing the transferred accounts  including an estimate of future net credit losses associated with the transferred accounts  plus our retained interest in the transferred receivables  discounted using a return that we estimate would be expected by a third party investor 
we recognize the income from our interest in these transferred accounts as gains on the transfer of the asset  interest income and servicing fees 
this income is recorded as finance charges and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  changes in the fair value of our interest are recorded in finance charges and other 
we value our interest in the cash flows of the qspe at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our interests in securitized assets using a discounted cash flow model with most of the inputs used being unobservable inputs 
the primary unobservable inputs  which are derived principally from our historical experience  with input from our investment bankers and financial advisors  include the estimated portfolio yield  net credit loss rate  discount rate  payment rate and delinquency rate and reflect our judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value 
we offer reage programs to past due customers that have experienced a financial hardship  if they meet the conditions of our reage policy 
reaging a customer s account can result in updating it from a delinquent status to a current status 
at january   reaged receivable balances represented of t he total portfolio balance held by the qspe 
the impact of our reaging programs are reflected in the historical payment rate  loss rate and delinquency trends considered in setting the market participant assumptions 
in determining the cost of borrowings  we use current actual borrowing rates  and adjust them  as appropriate  using interest rate futures data from market sources to project interest rates over time 
effective february   we will consolidate the operations of the qspe into our financial statements and the fair value of our interest in securitized assets will be eliminated in the consolidation 
see the discussion of recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact the consolidation will have on our financial statements during the twelve months ended january   finance charges and other included a non cash increase in the fair value our interests in securitized assets of million  reflecting primarily lower risk premiums included in the discount rate input during the year ended january   and a decrease in the discount period input for its net equity position  partially offset by changes in the funding mix  a higher net loss rate input and a lower portfolio yield input 
based on a review of the changes in market risk premiums during the year ended january   and discussions with its investment bankers and financial advisors  we estimated that a market participant would require a risk premium th at was approximately basis points less than was utilized at january  as a result  we decreased the weighted average discount rate input from at january  to at january   after reflecting a basis point decrease in the risk free interest rate included in the discount rate input at january  during the year ended january   after a review of the expected maturity dates on the conduit facility  we shortened the discount period input for our net equity position to be consistent with the final maturity on the existing bonds that finance the facility 
these increases were partially offset by a higher weighted average loss rate included in the inputs in the year ended january  based on our loss rate expectations and the additional risk premium that a market participant would require on that loss rate  we estimated that a market participant would require a loss rate input that was approximately basis points higher than what was utilized at january  as a result we increased the weighted average loss rate from to at january  these changes  along with changes in the funding mix inputs utilized  representing changes in the portion of company provided financing as opposed to the funding obtained by the qspe from third party sources  and other input changes which decreased the fair value  resulted in an increase in fair value for the fiscal year ended january  see reconciliation of the balance of interests in securitized assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the changes in fair value resulted in an increase in income before taxes of million  an increase in net income of million  and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of for the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
if a market participant were to require a discount rate that is higher than we estimated in the fair value calculation  the fair value of our interests in securitized assets would be decreased by an additional million as of january  if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates or reductions in rates charged on the accounts transferred  our interests in securitized assets and finance charges and other would have been reduced by million as of january  if the assumption used for estimating credit losses was increased by  the impact to finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million as of january  if the assumption used for the discount period on the net equity position was increased by  interests in securitized assets and finance charges and other would have been reduced by million as of january  revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the product 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services and discounts of promotional credit sales that will extend beyond one year 
we sell repair service agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligors on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
where we sell repair service renewal agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the repair service agreement 
these repair service agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts 
these agreements typically range from months to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting and are valued based on the agreed upon retail selling price 
the amounts of repair service renewal agreement revenues deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts of repair service agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing  training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost  cost of sales  or advertising expense  according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goo ds sold  if the programs are directly related to promotion or marketing of the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  represented advertising assistance allowances 
the increase in the current year is due to increased use of instant rebates by vendors to drive sales 
over the past three years we have received funds from approximately vendors  with the terms of the programs ranging between one month and one year 
accounting for leases 
we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold i mprovements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
receivables not sold 
accounts receivable not eligible for inclusion in the securitization program are carried on our consolidated balance sheet in customer accounts receivable 
we record the amount of principal on those receivables that is expected to be collected within the next twelve months  based on contractual terms  in current assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
those amounts expected to be collected after months  based on contractual terms  are included in long term assets 
typically  a receivable is considered delinquent if a payment has not been received on the scheduled due date 
additionally  we offer reage programs to past due customers th at have experienced a financial hardship  if they meet the conditions of our reage policy 
reaging a customer s account can result in updating it from a delinquent status to a current status 
generally  an account that is delinquent more than days and for which no payment has been received in the past seven months will be charged off against the allowance and interest accrued subsequent to the last payment will be reversed 
interest income is accrued using the rule of s method for installment contracts and the simple interest method for revolving charge accounts  and is reflected in finance charges and other 
typically  interest income is accrued until the contract or account is paid off or charged off and we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible interest 
interest income is recognized on our same as cash promotion accounts based on our historical experience related to customers that fail to satisfy the requirements of the interest free programs 
we have a secured interest in the merchandise financed by these receivables and therefore have the opportunity to recover a portion of the charged off amount 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our customer accounts receivable  based on our historical net loss experience and expectations for future losses 
the net charge off data used in computing the loss rate is reduced by the amount of post charge off recoveries received  including cash payments  amounts realized from the repossession of the products financed and  at times  payments under credit insurance policies 
additionally  we separately evaluate the primary and secondary portfolios when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and uncollectible interest for customer receivable s was million and million  at january   and  respectively 
additionally  as a result of our practice of reaging customer accounts  if the account is not ultimately collected  the timing and amount of the charge off is impacted 
if these accounts had been charged off sooner the historical net loss rates over time might have been higher 
due to the recent growth in the balance of receivables on the balance sheet  as of january   reaged receivable balances represented only of the total retained portfolio balance 
if the historical loss rate used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by at january   we would have increased our provision for bad debts by million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance to improve the relevance and comparability of the information which a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
when enacted  the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity will no longer be relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities as defined under previous accounting standards should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance wi th the applicable consolidation guidance 
if the evaluation on the effective date results in consolidation  the reporting entity should apply the transition guidance provided in the pronouncement that requires consolidation 
the new fasb issued authoritative guidance is effective for us beginning on february  in june  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements 
this revised guidance would require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics a 
the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance b 
the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
we have concluded that the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities and revised guidance related to variable interest entities discussed above will result in us consolidating the operations of our qspe  which is currently recorded off balance sheet  beginning february  additional discussion  including condensed  consolidated pro forma balance sheets and pro forma statements of operations  assuming we adopted these recently issued accounting pronouncements on february  are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations information as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated

these changes are discussed in the executive overview  and in more detail in the discussion of operating results beginning in the analysis below 
the presentation of our gross margins may not be comparable to other retailers since we include the cost of our in home delivery service as part of selling  general and administrative expense 
similarly  we include the cost of merchandising our products  including amounts related to purchasing the product in selling  general and administrative expense 
it is our understanding that other retailers may include such costs as part of cost of goods sold

the home appliance category declined as lower unit sales across the category were partially offset by higher average selling prices  as the appliance market in general showed continued weakness 
the decrease in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by reduced video game equipment  computer monitor  printer  gps device  camera  camcorder and audio equipment sales 
sales from netbooks and desktop and laptop computers were essentially flat as lower average selling prices offset a increase in unit sales of these products 
this decrease is due to the slower economic conditions in our markets in the last half of the fiscal year ended january  this category declined primarily due to reduced generator sales as we benefited from an increase in sales of generators in the areas affected by the hurricanes in the prior fiscal year that impacted certain of our markets 
additionally  lower lawn and garden sales due to the drought conditions experienced in many of our markets impacted sales in this category 
this decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of deliveries due largely to the overall decline in sales 
the repair service agreement commissions decreased due to reduced emphasis on this product as a result of our monitoring of the program offered to consumers and the training of our sales associates  in response to the texas attorney general s litigation 
we expect sales in this area to trend towards our historical performance levels over time due to the enhancements made as a result of the review 
this increase was driven by an increase in the cost of parts used to repair higher priced technology flat panel televisions  etc change dollars in thousands securitization income including fair value adjustment insurance commissions interest income and other finance charges and other the increase in securitization income resulted primarily from a million increase in the non cash fair value adjustment to our interests in securitized assets in the current year period  as compared to a million decrease in the prior year period 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in securitization income as a result of a reduction in the balances sold to our qspe

sg a expense increased as a percent of revenues due to the general de leve raging effect of the decline in same store sales 
partially offsetting that increase was the impact of the fair value adjustments related to our interests in securitized assets on total revenues  which accounted for approximately basis points of the decrease 
change dollars in millions goodwill impairment n a during the three months ended october   we determined  as a result of the sustained decline in our market capitalization and the current challenging economic environment and its impact on our comparable store sales  credit portfolio performance and operating results  that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary 
we concluded from our analysis that our goodwill was impaired and recorded a million charge to write off the carrying amount of our goodwill 
change dollars in millions provision for bad debts as a percent of total revenues the provision for bad debts on other receivables and customer receivables retained by us and not eligible to be transferred to the qspe increased primarily as a result of the increase in balances retained by us over the past six fiscal quarters  which led to an increase in the amount charged off  net of recoveries  of approximately million 
additionally  million of the increase in the provision for bad debts resulted from increases in the bad debt reserves as a result of the recent credit portfolio performance and expectations about future net charge offs 
see the notes to the financial statements for information regarding the performance of the credit portfolio and other discussion in the credit quality section under business strategy 
change dollars in thousands interest expense  net the increase in net interest expense was a result of interest incurred on our revolving credit facility  which grew from a balance of approximately million at to approximately million at  and is funding the customer receivables being retained on our consolidated balance sheet

the increase in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by increased video game equipment  blu ray player  laptop computer and gps device sales  partially offset by declines in camcorder  camera  mp player and desktop computer sales 
this increase is due to store expansion and a change in our furniture and mattresses merchandising driven by the multi vendor strategy implemented during the prior year 
this category benefited from an increase in sales of generators in the areas affected by the hurricanes that impacted certain of our markets and was partially offset by lower sales of lawn care equipment 
this decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of deliveries  primarily as customers take advantage of the ability to carry out smaller flat panel televisions

change dollars in thousands securitization income including fair value adjustment insurance commissions interest income and other finance charges and other the decline in securitization income resulted primarily from a million increase in the non cash fair value adjustment to reduce our interests in securitized assets 
additionally  as a result of the completion of our new revolving credit facility  we are retaining certain new customer receivables generated on our consolidated balance sheet and not transferring them to the qspe 
as a result of the reduced transfer of receivables to the qspe and the higher discount rate being in the determination of the fair value of the receivables  gains on sales of receivables included in securitization income has declined to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  because of the higher average balance of our retained interest in the receivables held by the qspe  as compared to t he same period in the prior year  and increases in the discount rate assumption used in our fair value calculation  interest earned on our retained interest included in securitization income has increased to million for the year ended january   from million in the prior year

change dollars in millions cost of service parts sold as a percent of service revenues this increase was due primarily to a increase in parts sales  which grew faster than labor sales 
change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of total revenues the increase in sg a expense was largely attributable to the addition of new stores and expenses of approximately million  net of estimated insurance proceeds  that we incurred related to the two hurricanes that occurred during the year 
the decrease in our sg a expense as a percent of revenues was negatively affected by the negative impact of the fair value adjustment on total revenues  with the decrease shown above being reduced by basis points due to the negative impact of the fair value adjustments on total revenues 
the improvement in our sg a expense as a percent of revenues was largely driven by lower compensation costs in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues as compared to the prior year  as well as reduced advertising expense as a percent of revenues 
additionally  reductions in certain store oper ating expenses  including repairs and maintenance and janitorial services contributed to the improvement 
partially offsetting these improvements were increases in utility  credit data processing and stock based compensation expenses 
change dollars in millions provision for bad debts as a percent of total revenues the provision for bad debts on non credit portfolio receivables and credit portfolio receivables retained by us and not eligible to be transferred to the qspe increased primarily as a result of increased balances of receivables retained by us 
the increase in customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet accounted for million of the increase  as we were required to increase the allowance for bad debts  otherwise the provision for bad debts would have declined 
see the notes to the financial statements for information regarding the performance of the credit portfolio 
change dollars in thousands interest income  net the increase in net interest expense was a result of interest incurred on our new revolving credit facility  which is funding the customer receivables being retained on our consolidated balance sheet

change dollars in thousands other income during the year ended january   there were approximately million of gains realized  but not recognized  on transactions qualifying for sale leaseback accounting that were deferred and are being amortized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease terms 
change dollars in millions provision for income taxes as a percent of income before income taxes due to the large non cash fair value adjustment reducing our interests in securitized assets this period  and the fact that taxes for the state of texas are recorded based on gross margin  instead of income before taxes  the effective rate was higher during the period as we did not receive a benefit for taxes for the state of texas on the non cash fair value adjustment 
the fiscal effective tax rate was reduced by the reversal of previously accrued texas margin tax as a result of a legal entity reorganization completed during that year 
impact of inflation and changing prices we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  price deflation  primarily in consumer electronics has impacted our net sales and results of operations 
a significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 
seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january  due primarily to the holiday selling season 
over the four quarters of fiscal  gross margins were   and 
during the same period  operating margins were   and 
our quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following o timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  o sales contributed by new stores  o increases or decreases in comparable store sales  o adverse weather conditions  o shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  o one time charges incurred  such as goodwill impairment and litigation reserves incurred in the third quarter of fiscal  and o changes in our merchandise mix 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year

we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of receivables to our asset backed securitization facilities 
at january   we had revolving lines of credit in the amount of million  under which we had million in borrowings outstanding  and had utilized million of availability to issue letters of credit 
as of january   we had million under our revolving credit facility and million under an unsecured bank line of credit immediately available to us for general corporate purposes 
in addition to the million currently available under the revolving credit facility  an additional million may become available under the borrowing base calculation as we grow the balance of eligible receivables retained by us and when there is growth in total eligible inventory balances 
recent credit portfolio performance resulted in a reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility of approximately million at january  this amount may become available in the future if credit portfolio performance improves  however  further decline in credit performance could lead to further reductions in availability 
the principal payments received on receivables held by us and by the qspe  which averaged approximately million per month during the fiscal year ended january   will also be available each month to fund new receivables generated 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at january  was  including the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including those for our capital expenditure requirements  will be met with our available lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations 
while we have no new stores currently under development for fiscal  our long term plans are to grow our store base by approximately a y ear  dependent upon future capital availability 
we expect we will invest in inventory  real estate and customer receivables to support the additional stores and same store sales growth 
depending on market conditions we may  at times  slow or suspend our new store growth plans  enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance our real estate or seek alternative financing sources for new store expansions and customer receivables growth  including expansion of existing lines of credit  and accessing new debt or equity markets 
during the twelve months ended january   our qspe reduced its receivable portfolio by million and paid off million in outstanding borrowings  while we borrowed million to finance a million increase in customer receivables on balance sheet 
as a result  the combined borrowings of the company and the qspe declined million 
a summary of the significant financial covenants that govern our revolving credit facility compared to our actual compliance status at january   as amended  is presented below 
these covenants were amended in february as discussed below  and the amendment required the covenants to be calculated on a consolidated basis to reflect the impact of inclusion of the qspe 
actual required minimum maximum fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed required minimum to to total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio must be lower than the required maximum to to cash recovery percentage must exceed required minimum capital expenditures  net must be lower than required maximum million million these covenants are also covenants of our qspe s credit facilities discussed below 
as a result of the declines in our profitability beginning in the quarter ended october   due to the slowdown in the economic conditions in our markets  we determined that there was a reasonable likelihood that we would trigger the default provisions of our credit facilities 
based on that expectation  we began working with our and our qspe s lenders to amend the covenants in the credit facilities 
we completed the necessary amendments in march  which resulted in the following changes fixed charge coverage ratio requirement reduced to to for the twelve month periods ended january   and april   before returning to a requirement of to beginning with the quarter ending july   the leverage ratio was replaced with a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth requirement  beginning as of january  with a required maximum of to at january   declining to to as of july  and then to to as of april  and each fiscal quarter thereafter  the interest rate on our revolving credit facility increased by basis points to libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  we will be required to pay a fee  as servicer of the qspe s receivables  equal to the following rates multiplied times the total available borrowing commitment under the qspe s revolving credit facility on the dates shown o basis points on may   o basis points on august   o basis points on november   o basis points on february   o basis point on may   and o basis points on august   the total available commitments under the qspe s revolving credit facility will be reduced from the current level of million to million in april and then to million in april  we will use the proceeds from any capital raising activity to further reduce the commitments and debt outstanding under the qspe s debt facilities  the maturity date on the qspe s revolving credit facility was reduced from september to august  and we may be required to complete certain additional tasks as servicer of the qspe s receivables  so long as commitments remain outstanding under the qspe s revolving credit facility 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances  that we will be in compliance with the above covenants through fiscal as we have done in the past  we will adjust the volume on new receivables sold to the qspe to allow it to use the proceeds of principal repayments from its accounts receivable portfolio to reduce the balance outstanding under its revolving credit facility prior to the commitment reduction date 
as of march   the balance under the qspe s revolving credit facility was million 
events of default under the credit facility include  but are not limited to  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  default under or acceleration of certain othe r indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain judgments and other liabilities  certain environmental claims  and a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions  including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full 
any repayment requirement or acceleration of amounts owed could have a material adverse affect on our business operations 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets  excluding customer receivables owned by the qspe and certain inventory subject to vendor floor plan arrangements 
we offer promotional credit programs to certain customers that provide for same as cash or deferred interest interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six    and months  and require monthly payments beginning in the month after the sale 
the various same as cash promotional accounts and deferred interest program accounts are eligible for securitization up to the limits provided for in our securitization agreements 
this limit is currently of eligible securitized receivables 
if we exceed this limit  we would be required to use some of our other capital resources to carry the unfunded balances of the receivables for the promotional period 
the percentage of eligible securitized receivables represented by promotional receivables was and  as of january   and  respectively 
there is no limitation on the amount of deferred interest program accounts that can be carried as collateral under the revolving credit facility 
the percentage of all managed receivables represented by promotional receivables was as of january   as compared to at january  the weighted average promotional period was months and months for the same as cash promotional receivables outstanding as of january   and  respectively 
the weighted average remaining term on those same promotional receivables was months and months as of january   and  respectively 
while overall these promotional receivables have a shorter weighted average term than non promotional receivables  we receive less income on these receivables  resulting in a reduction of the net interest margin on those receivables 
the following is a comparison of our statement of cash flows for our fiscal years and during the year ended january   net cash used in operating activities decreased to million  from million used in operating activities in the twelve months ended january  operating cash flows for the current period were impacted primarily by the increased retention of customer accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet offset by a reduction in inventories in light of reduced product sales 
there was also a decrease in accounts payable balances  due largely to the reduction of inventory  given the optimization of inventory levels 
those levels may increase dependent on product sales trends 
operating cash flows were also impacted by a drop in other accounts receivable  as amounts due from our vendors fell in the year ended january   as our vendors did not use sales incentive programs to th e extent they did in fourth quarter of the prior year 
there was also the impact of the decrease in taxes payable due to the reduction in our taxable income in the current year and the overpayment of estimated taxes leading to the recoverable income taxes balance at year end 
prior to the quarter ended october   virtually all customer accounts receivable were transferred to and funded by our qspe  resulting in the net cash flow activity from these transactions being reported in cash flows from operating activities 
however  the cash flow presentation is different for customer accounts receivable retained by us and financed through our revolving credit facility  with the increase in the accounts receivable balance being reflected as a use of cash in cash flows from operating activities  and borrowings on our revolving credit facility being reflected in cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million  from million used in the fiscal period to million used in the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from a decline in purchases of property and equipment compared to the prior fiscal year  as we opened fewer new stores in the fiscal period 
net cash from financing activities decreased by million from million provided during the year ended january   to million provided during the year ended january   as we decreased the amount of net borrowings after repayments under our revolving credit facility to fund the customer receivables generated and retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but do not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future new store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease prog rams  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership if it meets our cash investment strategy 
the following table reflects outstanding commitments for borrowings and letters of credit  and the amounts utilized under those commitments  as of january  commitment expires in fiscal year ending january  balance at available at there january  january  after total in thousands revolving bank facility unsecured line of credit inventory financing total includes letter of credit sublimit 
there was million of letters of credit issued at january  included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  repair service agreement and credit insurance sales  in august we entered into the million revolving credit facility and in we created a qspe to provide financing for the customer receivables we originate 
both the bank credit facility and the asset backed securitization program are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our growth and our overall business operations 
funding of current and future receivables under these facilities can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible receivable amounts 
we are financing customer receivable portfolio growth through the use of the bank revolving facility and expect this to be a primary source of funding our customer receivables portfolio during fiscal given the scheduled reductions required under our qspe s credit facilities  we will have to fund an increasing portion of the customer receivables generated using our existing cash flows  borrowings on our asset based loan facility and will likely be required to obtain new sources of financing to continue funding the growth of our credit operations 
we will continue to finance our operations and future growth through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements  debt or equity offerings and the qspe s asset backed securitization facilities 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and unsecured credit line  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and cash flows from the qspe s asset backed securitization program will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least months and the required million reduction in the qspe s funding commitment in april  subject to continued compliance with the covenants in our and our qspe s credit facilities 
however  there are several factors that could decrease cash provided by operating activities  including reduced demand or margins for our products  more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  loss of ability to acquire inventory on consignment  increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  changes in inventory requirements based on longer delivery times of the manufacturers or other requirements which would negatively impact our delivery and distribution capabilities  an acceleration of the growth of the credit portfolio  increases in the retained portion of our receivables portfolio under our current qspe s asset backed securitization program as a result of changes in performance or types of receivables transferred promotional versus non promotional and primary versus secondary portfolio  or as a result of a change in the mix of funding sources available to the qspe  requiring higher collateral levels  or limitations on the ability of the qspe to obtain financing through its commercial paper based funding sources  reduced availability under our revolving credit facility as a result of borrowing base requirements and the impact on the borrowing base calculation of changes in the performance of the receivables financed by that facility  reduced availability under our revolving credit facility or the qspe s financing facilities as a result of non compliance with the covenant requirements  reduced availability under our revolving credit facility or the qspe s financing facilities as a result of the inability of any of the financial institutions providing those facilities to fund their commitment  reductions in the capacity or inability to expand the capacity available for financing our receivables portfolio under existing or replacement qspe asset backed securitization programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  increases in program costs interest and administrative fees relative to our receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our receivables  increases in personnel costs or other costs for us to stay competitive in our markets  and if necessary  in addition to available cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities  additional cash to fund our growth and increases in receivables balances could be obtained by reducing capital expenditures for updates of existing stores or new store openings  taking advantage of longer payment terms and financing available for inventory purchases  utilizing third party sources to provide financing to our customers  reducing operating costs  negotiating to expand the capacity available under existing credit facilities  and accessing new debt or equity markets 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain these sources of funding on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet financing arrangements since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  repair service agreement and credit insurance sales  we created a qualified special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes secured by the receivables to third parties to obtain cash for these purchases 
we transfer receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated  unsecured promissory notes 
to finance its acquisition of these receivables  the issuer has issued the notes and bonds described below to third parties 
the unsecured promissory notes issued to us are subordinate to these third party notes and bonds 
at january   the issuer had issued two series of notes and bonds the series a variable funding note with a total capacity of million and three classes of series a bonds with an aggregate amount outstanding of million  of which million was required to be placed in a restricted cash account for the benefit of the bondholders 
the series a variable funding note is currently composed of a million tranche that is annually renewable  at our option until august in april  this commitment will be reduced to million  and then will be reduced to million in april if the three month average net portfolio yield  as defined by agreements  falls below  then the issuer may be required to fund additions to the cash reserves in the restricted cash accounts 
the three month avera ge net portfolio yield was at january  private institutional investors  primarily insurance companies  purchased the series a bonds at a weighted fixed rate of 
the series a bonds begin a month amortization of the principal balance in september  with interest only payments required monthly until that time 
the weighted average interest on the variable funding note during the month of january was 
on april   one of the banks supporting the commercial paper that funds the variable funding note was downgraded by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
while we initially saw the qspe s borrowing costs increase  we do not believe it is having a significant impact on the borrowing rate at this time and it has not impacted the bank s ability to meet its funding obligations to the qspe 
we continue to service the transferred accounts for the qspe  and we receive a monthly servicing fee  so long as we act as servicer  in an amount equal to 
multiplied by the average aggregate principal amount of receivables serviced 
the issuer records revenues equal to the interest charged to the customer on the receivables less losses  the cost of funds  the program administration fees paid in connection with either the series a  or series a bond holders  the servicing fee and additional earnings to the extent they are available 
the series a variable funding note permits the issuer to borrow funds up to the total commitment available to purchase receivables from us or make principal payments on other bonds  thereby functioning as a basket to accumulate receivables 
as issuer borrowings under the series a variable funding note approach the total commitment  the issuer is required to request an increase in the series a amount or issue a new series of bonds and use the proceeds to pay down the then outstanding balance of the series a variable funding note  so that the basket will once again become available to accumulate new receivables or meet other obligations required under the transaction documents 
given the current state of the financial markets  especially with respect to asset backed securitization financing  we have been unable to issue medium term notes or increase the availability under the existing variable funding note program 
as of january   borrowings under the series a variable funding note were million and were million as of march  we are not directly liable to the lenders under the asset backed securitization facility 
however  if the issuer is unable to repay the series a note and series a bonds due to its inability to collect the transferred customer accounts  the issuer could not pay the subordinated notes it has issued to us in partial payment for transferred customer accounts  and the series a bond holders could claim the balance in its million restricted cash account 
we are also contingently liable under a million letter of credit that secures the performance of our obligations or services under the servicing agreement as it relates to the transferred assets that are part of the asset backed securitization facility 
the issuer is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants contained in the transaction documents governing the series a variable funding note and series a bonds  including covenants that restrict  subject to specified exceptions the incurrence of non permitted indebtedness and other obligations and the granting of additional liens  mergers  acquisitions  investments and disposition of assets  and the use of proceeds of the program 
the issuer also makes representations and warranties relating to compliance with certain laws  payment of taxes  maintenance of its separate legal entity  preservation of its existence  protection of collateral and financial reporting 
in addition  the program requires the issuer to maintain a minimum net worth 
a summary of the significant financial covenants  as amended  that govern the series a variable funding note compared to actual compliance status at january   is presented below as reported required minimum maximum issuer interest must exceed required minimum million million gross loss rate must be lower than required maximum a serviced portfolio gross loss rate must be lower than required maximum b net portfolio yield must exceed required minimum a serviced portfolio net portfolio yield must exceed required minimum b payment rate must exceed required minimum a serviced portfolio payment rate must exceed required minimum a consolidated net worth must exceed required minimum million million a calculated for those receivables transferred to the qspe 
b calculated for the total of receivables transferred to the qspe and those retained by us 
note all terms in the above table are defined by the asset backed securitization program and may or may not agree directly to the financial statement captions in this document 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances  that we will be in compliance with the above covenants through fiscal events of default under the series a variable funding note and the series a bonds  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in some circumstances  include  among others failure of the issuer to pay principal  interest or fees  violation by the issuer of any of its covenants or agreements  inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the issuer  certain servicer defaults  failure of the trustee to have a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the collateral  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  failure to maintain certain loss ratios and portfolio yield  change of control provisions and certain other events pertaining to us 
the issuer s obligations under the program are secured by the receivables and proceeds

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable and are determined  at our option  as the base rate  which is the prime rate plus the base rate margin  which ranges from to  or libor plus the libor margin  which ranges from to 
interest rates under our qspe s variable funding note facility are variable and are determined based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate  the commercial paper rate or libor  which are affected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  these credit facilities 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk in determining the fair value of the interest only strip we receive from our sales of receivables to the qspe  due to rate variability under the qspe s variable funding note discussed above 
an increase in interest rates that reduced the net interest spread under the interest only strip by would result in a million reduction in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets 
since january   our interest rate sensitivity has decreased on the interest only strip as the variable rate portion of the qspe s debt has decreased from million  or of its total debt  to million  or of its total debt 
as a result  a basis point increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt would increase borrowing costs million over a month p eriod  based on the balance outstanding at january  at january   there was million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on march   we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million to fix the rate on a portion of these balances and on june   we entered into an additional million of interest rate swaps to fix the rate on a portion of the balances 
as a result  a basis point increase in interest rates on the revolving credit facility would increase our borrowing costs by million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january   after considering the impact of the interest rate swaps
