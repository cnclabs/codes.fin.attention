item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the matters addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may contain certain forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
overview enova systems believes it is a leading innovator of proprietary hybrid and electric drive systems propelling the alternative energy industry 
our core competencies are focused on the development and commercialization of power management and conversion systems for mobile and stationary applications 
enova applies unique enabling technologies in the areas of alternative energy propulsion systems for medium and heavy duty vehicles as well as power conditioning and management systems for distributed generation systems 
our products can be found in a variety of oem vehicles including those from navistar corporation  first auto works  freightliner customer chassis corporation  hyundai motor company and ford motor company  trucks and buses for tanfield and its us subsidiary  smith electric vehicles  wright bus  optare plc and the us military  as well as digital power systems for edo and other major manufacturers 
we continue to support navistar in their efforts to maximize exposure in the hybrid school bus market 
we have been involved in large shows in st 
louis  mo  washington  dc and the principality of monaco as well as smaller venues throughout the midwest 
the exposure via shows and direct interface will be aggressively pursued throughout the remainder of in an effort to promote our drive systems production intent for medium and heavy duty applications 
some notable highlights of enova s accomplishments in are enova achieved its certification for iso for quality and iso for environmental management over its operational and manufacturing processes 
in order to receive iso certifications for quality and environmental management systems  an organization must demonstrate operating systems and procedures for managing its processes to consistently turn out products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements  as well as identify and control the environmental impact of its activities  products or services 
our customer  navistar  with enova systems as a co applicant  was selected to receive a cost shared award of up to million under the department of energy plug in hybrid electric vehicle phev technology acceleration and deployment activity program to develop and deploy plug in electric hybrid school buses  including engine off all electric drive capability 
enova was awarded an exclusive supplier contract with the us general services administration gsa  which provides vehicles for government agencies and armed forces 
under this contract  enova will supply enova ze all electric walk in step vans to gsa under the cargo vans category 
freightliner custom chassis corporation fccc  a division of daimler trucks north america  executed a letter of intent with enova to enter into an all electric commercial chassis development program 
the development program includes close collaboration and will involve the engineering and integration of enova s kw all electric drive system technology into target fccc chassis platforms  including the mt walk in van chassis 
fccc s highest volume mt chassis is used by a range of customers including ups and federal express 
the strategic agreement consists of four phases that include the development of vehicles and placement into national fleets 
design  engineering  integration and testing activities will be conducted at the fccc plant in gaffney  sc and the enova facility in torrance  ca 
enova delivered pre transmission hybrid drive systems to first auto works faw of china 
faw s jiefang meter hybrid bus can carry passengers 
these hybrid power buses are part of china s initiative to produce  electric and hybrid power vehicles 
the initiative will account for of the 
table of contents chinese automobile market  which is in accordance with china s three year development plan for its auto industry  released in february enova saw further federal fleet penetration potential via gsa with the smith electric vehicles smith newton product offering in the medium and heavy duty vehicle category 
the smith newton is another exclusive  all electric medium and heavy duty truck offering on the gsa product menu 
moreover  navistar continued to demonstrate its leadership in the american school bus market with its exclusive gsa contract to supply hybrid school buses 
enova is the exclusive supplier of hybrid electric drive systems to ic bus  an affiliated division of navistar 
the state of kentucky won a million department of energy clean cities grant for hybrid school buses 
our customer  navistar corporation  claims of the market for school buses in kentucky 
enova has already installed our post transmission hybrid drive system with a new  lighter weight lithium ion battery in a demonstration bus 
other clean cities grants may be available for an additional million 
we continue to work closely with navistar and anticipate we may benefit from these programs starting in enova s product focus is digital power management and power conversion systems 
its software  firmware  and hardware manage and control the power that drives either a vehicle or stationary device s 
they convert the power into the appropriate forms required by the vehicle or device and manage the flow of this energy to optimize efficiency and provide protection for both the system and its users 
our products and systems are the enabling technologies for power systems 
the latest state of the art technologies in hybrid and electric vehicles  fuel cell systems and stationary power generation  all require some type of power management and conversion mechanism 
enova systems supplies these essential components 
enova drive systems are fuel neutral  meaning that they have the ability to utilize any type of fuel  including diesel  liquid natural gas or bio diesel fuels 
we also develop  design and produce power management and power conversion components for stationary power generation both on site distributed power and on site telecommunications back up power applications 
additionally  enova performs significant research and development to augment and support others and our internal related product development efforts 
our products are production engineered 
this means they are designed so they can be commercially produced ie  all formats and files are designed with manufacturability in mind  from the start 
for the automotive market  enova designs its products to iso manufacturing and quality standards 
we believe enova s redundancy of systems and rigorous quality standards result in high performance and reduced risk 
for every component and piece of hardware  there are detailed performance specifications 
each piece is tested and evaluated against these specifications  which enhances and confirms the value of the systems to oem customers 
our engineering services focus on system integration support for product sales and custom product design 
in light of our efforts to grow market share in our target markets and penetrate emerging ones  the company continues to acknowledge the principal barrier to commercialization of our drive systems is cost 
the cost of engineering proprietary software and hardware for our drive systems is high because economies of production in specialized hybrid drive system component parts  batteries  and vehicle integration have not been achieved 
therefore  the cost of our products and engineering services are currently higher than our gasoline and diesel competitor counterparts 
we also believe maturation into commercialization of our drive systems will result in decreases to our long run average costs of materials and services as volume increases over time 
critical accounting policies the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues which require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
cash and cash equivalents cash consists of currency held at reputable financial institutions 
short term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable  however  changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
past due balances over days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectibility 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  the company maintains a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
inventory inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first in  first out fifo cost flow assumption 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
inventory reserve we maintain an allowance against inventory for the potential future obsolescence or excess inventory 
a substantial decrease in expected demand for our products  or decreases in our selling prices could lead to excess or overvalued inventories and could require us to substantially increase our allowance for excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to seven years using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
the company uses other depreciation methods generally  accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends  and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
long lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
equity method investment investment in itc  a joint venture is accounted for by the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  an investee company s accounts are not reflected within the company s balance sheets or statements of operations  however  the company s share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption equity in losses of non consolidated joint venture in the statements of operations 
the company s carrying value in an equity method joint venture company is reflected in the caption investment in non consolidated joint venture in the company s balance sheets 
stock based compensation the company calculates stock based compensation expense in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
this pronouncement requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  to be based on estimated fair values 
the company s determination of estimated fair value of share based awards utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding 
table of contents certain highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards as well as actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
revenue recognition the company manufactures proprietary products and other products based on design specifications provided by its customers 
the company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement the company documents all terms of an arrangement in a written contract signed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the company performs all services or delivers all products prior to recognizing revenue 
professional consulting and engineering services are considered to be performed when the services are complete 
equipment is considered delivered upon delivery to a customer s designated location 
in certain instances  the customer elects to take title upon shipment 
the fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue  a customer s fee is either fixed or determinable under the terms of the written contract 
fees for professional consulting services  engineering services and equipment sales are fixed under the terms of the written contract 
the customer s fee is negotiated at the outset of the arrangement and is not subject to refund or adjustment during the initial term of the arrangement 
collectibility is reasonably assured the company determines that collectibility is reasonably assured prior to recognizing revenue 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis based on criteria outlined by management 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay 
the company does not enter into arrangements unless collectibility is reasonably assured at the outset 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined during the arrangement that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized on a cash basis 
amounts received upfront for engineering or development fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of committed services or performance  if such arrangements require the company to provide on going services or performance 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research and development contracts are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
fasb asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc addresses the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  asc requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  the company applies the principles of asc to multiple element agreements 
the company also recognizes engineering and construction contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
customer furnished materials  labor  and equipment  and in certain cases subcontractor materials  labor  and equipment  are included in revenues and cost of revenues when management believes that the company is responsible for the ultimate acceptability of the project 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 
revenues recognized in excess of 
table of contents amounts billed are classified as current assets under contract work in progress 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to engineering and development contract costs and revenue 
these accounting policies were applied consistently for all periods presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results is included in the footnotes to our financial statements 
several other factors related to the company may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year 
for example  the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition related to product contracts are complex and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction 
factors such as acceptance of services provided  payment terms  creditworthiness of the customer  and timing of delivery or acceptance of our products often cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods 
for arrangements in which services revenue is deferred  related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred 
research and development in accordance with fasb asc research and development  research  development  and engineering costs are expensed in the year incurred 
costs of significantly altering existing technology are expensed as incurred

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues were  for the twelve months ended december   representing a decrease of  or from net revenues of  during the same period in the decline in revenue in compared to is mainly due to a decrease in sales to tanfield  due to a change in their growth strategy in the third quarter of  as well as the completion of several low volume contracts for non core customers in however  sales to faw increased by over times in due to chinese government policies promoting the purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles in their auto market 
faw  navistar and hcatt comprised  and  respectively  of our revenues 
in the prior year  tanfield  navistar and hcatt comprised  and  respectively of our revenues  while faw comprised only of revenues in the period 
the company continued its strategy to concentrate support to core customers in in our migration to a first tier production company  recording sales with several oems  including faw in china and navistar  freightliner and smith electric vehicles in the united states 
although we have seen indications for future production growth  there can be no assurance there will be continuing demand for our products and services 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
the improvement in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to our strategy to concentrate on higher volume production orders and our continuing focus on manufacturing and inventory processes that resulted in tighter control over production costs 
cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  integration costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products as well as inventory valuation reserve amounts 
product development costs incurred in the performance of engineering development contracts for the us government and private companies are charged to cost of sales 
our customers continue to require additional integration and support services to customize  integrate and evaluate our products 
we believe that a portion of these costs are initial  one time costs for these customers and anticipate similar costs to be incurred with respect to new customers as we pursue a greater market share 
typically we do not incur these same types of costs for customers who have been using our products over one year 
gross margin 
the gross margin for the year ended december  was positive compared to a negative in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to our focus on key customer production contracts  maturity of our supply chain  and efficiencies gained through focus on manufacturing and inventory processes that resulted in tighter controls over production costs 
as we continue to make deliveries on production contracts in  we expect to achieve continued benefit from these initiatives  although we may continue to experience variability in our gross margin 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  facilities  equipment and supplies for our research and development activities 
non funded development costs are reported as research and development expense 
research and development expenses during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
r d costs were higher in due to expenditures to complete the development of our wireless tracking module  a one time cost incurred for a dynamometer testing of our hybrid system and a higher level of resources expended for development projects 
in  r d efforts were focused on development of our new ze all electric vehicle  a next generation motor control unit  testing of new battery technologies as well as engine off capability for our post transmission parallel hybrid drive system 
development resources utilized in support of non core development projects were reduced consistent with our focus on higher volume customers 
we also continued to allocate necessary resources to the development and testing of upgraded proprietary control software  enhanced dc dc converters and digital inverters and other power management firmware 
we will continue to research and develop new technologies and products  both internally and in conjunction with our alliance partners and other manufacturers as we deem beneficial to our global growth strategy 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing costs  including consulting fees and expenses for travel  trade shows and promotional activities and personnel and related costs for the quality and field service functions and general corporate functions  including finance  strategic and business development  human resources  it and mrp implementation  accounting 
table of contents reserves and legal costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  during the year ended december  to  from  in the prior year

in addition  a charge of  in was recorded as a bad debt expense for outstanding receivable balances that were deemed unlikely to be collected  as compared to a bad debt expense of zero recorded in interest and other income expense 
for the year ended december   interest and other income expense was a negative  representing a decrease of  or negative  from  in interest income decreased as a result of the company having a smaller average cash balance and lower interest rates on cash balances between the respective periods in and in  the company recorded a loss in settlement of a vendor dispute and a loss on disposal of metal molds of a discontinued model of an electric motor in equity in losses of non consolidated joint venture 
for the year ended december   itc s operations generated an equity loss of  utilizing the equity method of accounting for our interest in the pro rata share of losses attributable to this investment  which represents a decrease of  or  from the  equity loss in the year ended december  in addition  a gain of  was recorded upon the dissolution of the joint venture in april liquidity and capital resources we have experienced losses primarily attributable to research  development  marketing and other costs associated with our strategic plan as an international developer and supplier of electric drive and power management systems and components 
cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to meet our obligations 
therefore  we have had to raise funds through several financing transactions 
at least until we reach breakeven volume in sales and develop and or acquire the capability to manufacture and sell our products profitably  we will need to continue to rely on cash from external financing sources 
our operations during the year ended december  were financed by product sales  working capital reserves and equity capital raises 
at fiscal year end  the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company had a secured revolving credit facility from union bank the credit agreement for  which expired on june  the credit agreement was secured by a  certificate of deposit cd

we anticipate that the credit facility will be renewed with similar terms as the existing facility 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year ended december  cash used in operating activities was affected mostly by the cost of revenue  r d  personnel and general operating costs  which was partially mitigated by our utilization of existing inventory balances to fulfill customer orders in non cash items included expenses for stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  inventory reserve  reserve for doubtful accounts  equity losses in our non consolidated joint venture  and issuance of common stock for services 
net cash from investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of  in the prior year 
in conjunction with the reduction of our credit facility  as explained above  we redeemed a certificate of deposit for  for use in operating activities 
in addition  we received proceeds of  from the dissolution of the enova itc joint venture 
cash used in investing activities in was attributed to leasehold improvements and fixed asset purchases associated with our move into a new facility and the purchase of a certificate of deposit of  used as security for the revolving credit facility 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided of  for the year ended december  on december   we raised capital through the placement of common stock
