item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those described in such statements is contained below and in item a 
risk factors of this report 
overview we are a commercial finance company that provides customized debt financing solutions to middle market businesses and commercial real estate borrowers and manages investment funds for large institutional investors 
we principally focus on the direct origination of loans that meet our risk and return parameters 
our direct origination efforts target mid sized companies  private equity sponsors  corporate executives  regional banks  real estate investors and a variety of other financial intermediaries to source transaction opportunities 
direct origination provides direct access to customers management  enhances due diligence  and allows significant input into customers capital structure and direct negotiation of transaction pricing and terms 
we operate as a single segment and derive revenues from two specialized lending groups middle market corporate  which originates  structures and underwrites senior debt and  to a lesser extent  second lien  mezzanine and subordinated debt  and equity and equity linked products for companies with annual ebitda typically between million and million  and commercial real estate  which originates  structures and underwrites first mortgage debt and  to a lesser extent  subordinated debt  primarily to finance acquisitions of real estate properties typically valued between million and million 
subsequent to december   we discontinued the origination of structured products and continue to manage the remaining portfolio within our middle market corporate lending group 
as of december   this portfolio had an outstanding balance of million 
market conditions while the economy remains weak  economic conditions improved in the second half of  showing signs of improvement as gdp growth resumed following a year of steady contraction 
while volumes in the loan market remained low  we are seeing areas of improvement  such as the strong rebound of the high yield market 
increasing loan values have also led to some improvement in the term debt securitization  or clo market where bonds are now trading at higher levels 
we expect this favorable trend to continue if there is positive investor sentiment of the macro economy  default expectations recalibrate  spreads tighten across other types of asset backed securities and corporate credit continues to improve into although the economy has improved  amendments and renewals of our existing credit facilities obtained in and the clo we completed in january of have been at lower committed amounts  higher interest rates and provide lower advance rates than similar transactions completed in prior periods 
while we have been negatively impacted by the trend toward higher cost of borrowing and lower leverage  we believe that we have also benefitted from these market conditions by re pricing our existing loans when possible  and originating new loans when possible at significantly higher yields and in many cases on more favorable terms 
during the second half of  the negative credit migration in our loan portfolio moderated  but the difficult economic conditions continued to have a negative impact on the financial performance of our borrowers and their ability to make their scheduled payments 
as such  we continued to increase our allowance for credit losses 
we are closely monitoring the credit quality of our loans 
we expect loan delinquencies  non accruals  and charge offs to remain elevated due to weak economic conditions 

table of contents as a result of the current market and funding conditions  opportunities in the commercial real estate market have slowed  and the quality of our commercial real estate loans underlying collateral has declined 
should we foreclose on any of our commercial real estate loans  our recovery rates would be negatively impacted by these market and funding conditions 
moreover  refinancing current real estate loans has been and will continue to be difficult 
we have not originated any new commercial real estate loans since the first quarter of recent developments liquidity on november   we amended our credit facility with citicorp north america  inc citicorp  which reduced the commitment amount under the facility to million from million and extended the facility s liquidity line until november  completing the annual renewal 
the amendment was effective as of november  the facility is scheduled to mature on november  on january   we entered into a note agreement with fortress credit corp  an affiliate of fortress investment group fortress 
under the terms of the note agreement  fortress agreed to provide a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature on july  on january   we completed a million term debt securitization  net of a million discount 
as part of the securitization  investors purchased approximately million floating rate asset backed notes 
we retained the remaining million of notes 
the notes are expected to mature on july  proceeds from this term debt securitization were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our term debt facility with deutsche bank ag  new york branch deutsche and certain advances under our credit facility with citicorp north america  inc stock repurchase program on january   we announced that our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of any shares purchased will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market condition and other factors 
the repurchase program  which will expire on january  unless extended by the board of directors  may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 
credit as of december   we had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million classified as impaired 
nineteen of these impaired loans with an outstanding balance of million were on non accrual status as of december  during the year ended december   we recorded million of specific provisions for impaired loans 
results of operations for the years ended december   and newstar s basic and diluted loss per share for was on a net loss of million compared to basic and diluted income per share of on net income of million for  and a basic and diluted loss per share of on a net loss of million for our managed loan portfolio was billion at december  compared to billion at december  and during  loans owned by the ncof decreased million to million at year end 
as further described below  the most significant factors influencing our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were i million of specific provisions recorded for impaired loans during  ii a decrease in asset management income  iii a decrease in syndication and other fee income  and iv a decrease in compensation and benefits expense 

table of contents loan portfolio yield loan portfolio yield  which is interest income on our loans divided by the average balances outstanding of our loans  was for  for and for the decrease from to in loan portfolio yield was primarily driven by a decrease in three month libor over the prior year  the increase of loans on non accrual status and  to a lesser extent  changes in product mix and credit spreads in our loan portfolio 
the portfolio yield for accruing loans was for the decrease from to in loan portfolio yield was primarily driven by a decrease in prevailing interest rates over the prior year and  to a lesser extent  changes in product mix and credit spreads in our loan portfolio 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for  for and for the primary factors impacting net interest margin were changes in three month libor  non accrual loans  our product mix  debt to equity ratio  credit spreads and cost of borrowings 
efficiency ratio our efficiency ratio  which is total operating expenses divided by net interest income before provision for credit losses plus total non interest income  was for  for and for the increase in our efficiency ratio during as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and non interest income during the decrease in our efficiency ratio during as compared to was primarily due to the million loss on the residual interest during and impairment charges on investments in debt securities during  as well as a decline in operating expenses during allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses ratio  which is allowance for credit losses divided by outstanding gross loans excluding loans held for sale  was at december   as of december  and as of december  the allowance for credit losses at december  included a specific allowance of million and a general allowance of million 
the allowance for credit losses at december  included specific allowance of million and a general allowance of million 
the allowance for credit losses at december  included a specific allowance of million and a general allowance of million 
the increase in our specific allowance is primarily due to economic conditions negatively impacting our borrowers 
during the second quarter of  we adjusted our allowance for credit losses methodology regarding commercial real estate to better reflect deteriorating market conditions  which has increased the probability of default for borrowers with high loan to value ratios 
we continually evaluate our allowance for credit losses methodology 
if we determine that a change in our allowance for credit losses methodology is advisable  as a result of the rapidly changing economic environment or otherwise  the revised allowance methodology may result in higher levels of allowance 
moreover  if weakened market conditions persist  actual losses under our current or any revised methodology may differ materially from our estimate 
delinquent loan rate delinquent loan rate  which is total delinquent loans that are days or more past due  divided by outstanding gross loans  was as of december  as compared to as of december  given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the delinquent loan rate to remain elevated as economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of our borrowers and their ability to meet their obligations on a timely basis 

table of contents delinquent loan rate for accruing loans days or more past due delinquent loan rate for accruing loans days or more past due  which is total delinquent accruing loans net of charge offs that are days or more past due and less than days past due  divided by outstanding gross loans  was as of december  as compared to as of december  given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the delinquent accruing loan rate to remain elevated as economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of our borrowers and their ability to meet their obligations on a timely basis 
non accrual loan rate non accrual loan rate is defined as total balances outstanding of loans on non accrual status divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans held for investment 
loans are put on non accrual status if they are days or more past due or if management believes it is probable that the company will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business 
the non accrual loan rate was as of december  and as of december  as of december  and the aggregate outstanding value of non accrual loans was million and million  respectively 
given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the non accrual loan rate to remain elevated as economic conditions impair our borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreement 
non performing asset rate non performing asset rate is defined as the sum of total balances outstanding of loans on non accrual status and other real estate owned  divided by the sum of the total outstanding balance of our loans held for investment and other real estate owned 
the non performing asset rate was as of december  and as of december  as of december  and the sum of the aggregate outstanding value of non performing assets was million and million  respectively 
given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the non performing asset rate to remain elevated as economic conditions impair our borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreements 
net charge off rate end of period loans net charge off rate as a percentage of end of period loan portfolio is defined as annualized charge offs net of recoveries divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans held for investment 
a charge off occurs when management believes that all or part of the principal of a particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid 
for the years ended december   and  the net charge off rate was  and  respectively 
we expect the net charge off rate end of period loans to remain elevated as economic conditions impair our borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreement 
net charge off rate average period loans net charge off rate as a percentage of average period loan portfolio is defined as annualized charge offs net of recoveries divided by the average total outstanding balance of our loans held for investment for the period 
for the years ended december   and  the net charge off rate was  and  respectively 
we expect the net charge off rate average period loans to remain elevated as economic conditions impair our borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreement

interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to from  primarily driven by a decrease in three month libor and the increase in loans on non accrual status 
average three month libor decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our cost of borrowings and a decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in our cost of borrowings  to from  was primarily attributable to a decrease in three month libor and increased use of lower cost term debt securitizations 
the decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities is primarily attributable to the reduction of total debt from billion as of december  to billion as of december  net interest margin 
net interest margin decreased to for from for the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets and non payment of interest income from non accrual loans  partially offset by an increase in interest yields on 
table of contents new loan originations and re pricings and a decrease in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in yield and cost is primarily due to a decrease in three month libor 
the net interest spread  the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  increased to from 
the decline in libor negatively impacted the net interest margin  which was partially offset by libor floor provisions included in our customer contracts 
at december   of our adjustable rate loans included interest rate floors 
non accrual loans negatively impacted the net interest margin by  which was offset by an increase in interest spreads 
we expect our net interest margin to be negatively impacted in by an increase in our cost of funds from the new clo and new revolving note credit facility with fortress both completed in january  and the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees resulting from the repayment of our deutsche term debt facility 
the following table summarizes the yield and cost of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for and year ended december  year ended december  in thousands average balance interest income expense average yield cost average balance interest income expense average yield cost total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses increased to million for from million for the increase in the provision was primarily due to million of specific provisions recorded during for impaired loans 
the decrease in the general component of the provision for credit losses to of the total provision for  as compared to of the total provision for  was principally due to the migration of loans covered by our general allowance for credit losses to impaired loans covered by our specific allowance for credit losses as difficult economic conditions continued to have a negative impact on the financial performance of our borrowers and their ability to make their scheduled payments 
loans subject to our general allowance for credit losses declined to billion at december  as compared to billion at both december  and our general allowance for credit losses covers probable losses in our loan portfolio with respect to loans for which no specific impairment has been identified 
a specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized 
impaired loans  which include all of our delinquent loans and all troubled debt restructurings  as a percentage of loans  net increased to as of december  as compared to as of december  in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  when a loan is classified as impaired  the loan is evaluated for a specific allowance and a specific provision may be recorded  thereby removing it from consideration under the general component of the allowance analysis 
consequently  as the number and aggregate amount of impaired loans have increased and we have added to the specific reserve  the aggregate amount of loans being evaluated under our general allowance analysis has decreased 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  a base allowance is provided for loans that are not impaired 
the company employs a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk  which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans 
the company s allowance framework addresses economic conditions  capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top down and bottom up perspective 
the company considers and evaluates changes in economic conditions  credit availability  industry and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents on at least a quarterly basis  loans are internally risk rated based on individual credit criteria  including loan type  loan structures including balloon and bullet structures common in the company s middle market corporate and commercial real estate cash flow loans  borrower industry  payment capacity  location and quality of collateral if any including the company s commercial real estate loans 
borrowers provide the company with financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis 
ratings  corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition or profile 
for middle market corporate loans  the data set used to construct probabilities of default in its allowance for loan losses model  moody s crd private firm database  primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar to the company s loans 
the company also considers the quality of the loan terms in determining a loan loss in the event of default 
for commercial real estate loans  the company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions 
first  a loan s risk rating  and thereby its assumed default likelihood  can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions 
second  to the extent that economic or industry trends adversely affect a borrower s loan to value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability  the company applies a stress multiplier to the loan s probability of default 
the multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline 
additionally  when determining the amount of the general allowance  the company supplements the base amount with a judgmental amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of ten individually weighted risk factors 
the risk factors are designed based on those outlined in the comptrollers of the currency s allowance for loan and lease losses handbook 
the company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money center banks  regional banks and finance companies 
while the company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for credit losses  it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the allowance for credit losses computation 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment of a loan is based upon i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
impaired loans are identified based on the loan by loan risk rating process described above 
it is the company s policy during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
impaired loans at december  and were in both commercial real estate and in middle market corporate  over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following buildings and commercial real estate  broadcast and entertainment  nondurable consumer products  energy and chemical services  industrial and other business services 
for impaired middle market corporate loans  the company measured impairment based on expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability 
such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms 
for impaired commercial real estate loans  the company determined that the loans were collateral dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third party appraisers  as well as internal estimates of market value 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in fee income  a million decrease 
table of contents in asset management income  a million decline in fair value of other real estate owned  as well as the loss of million attributable to the consolidation of the noncontrolling interest of the entity which owns the other real estate owned  a million loss on the sale of other real estate owned  and a million gain recognized in connection with the repurchase of debt during  partially offset by a million gain recognized in connection with the repurchase of debt during  and a million gain on sale of an equity instrument 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  to million for from million for employee compensation and benefits decreased million primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation  a decrease in the non cash compensation charge related to restricted stock grants made since our inception  including equity awards made in connection with the initial public offering and lower headcount  partially offset by severance costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million due primarily to million of acquisition related costs and loan workout costs of million 
occupancy and equipment expenses decreased million 
income taxes 
for and  we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for reflects the impact of nondeductible compensation expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering and the impact of a related discrete item resulting from vesting events in as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining that a valuation allowance of million was needed at december  examples of positive and negative evidence considered include our recent history of taxable income  trends in our earnings  positive financial ratios including levels of capital that we believe are sufficient to withstand the current economic environment  and the impact of the downturn in the current economic environment including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses  and the impact on funding levels on the company 
we also considered in our assessment the level of income taxes paid in previous periods 
we considered the carryback potential in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
we had a net loss of million for  pre tax income of million for  and a net loss of million for additionally  results reflect the sale of the majority of its structured products securities and loans to a third party in june  which resulted in a loss of million  in addition to million of previously incurred impairment losses 
subsequent to december   we discontinued the origination of structured products 
we held one investment security available for sale at december  with a carrying value of million related to structured products 
we noted that these factors  which drove the loss in  lend positive support when added back to pre tax income 
additionally  we evaluated our business plans and results during our forecast period of future taxable income 
such consideration included liquidity  earnings results including anticipated level of credit losses over a reasonable period of time  available sources of funding and capital from existing sources 
our forecast utilized in our december  analysis included a sufficient level of earnings over a reasonable period of time 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon carryback availability  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and interest income 
interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to from primarily driven by a decrease in three month libor  partially offset by growth in average interest earning assets of million 
average three month libor decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our cost of borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average borrowings of million from december  to fund growth in interest earning assets 
the decrease in our cost of borrowings  to from  was primarily attributable to a decrease in three month libor  negotiated lower borrowing spreads on our credit facilities and increased use of lower cost term debt securitizations 
net interest margin 
net interest margin decreased to for from for the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets and non payment of interest income from non accrual loans  partially offset by an increase in interest yields on new loan originations and re pricings and a decrease in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in yield and cost is primarily due to a decrease in three month libor 
the net interest spread  the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  increased to from as the decline in three month libor had a greater impact on the cost of interest bearing liabilities which re price more frequently than our interest earning assets

operating expenses decreased million  to million for from million for employee compensation and benefits decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the non cash compensation charge related to restricted stock grants made since our inception  including equity awards made in connection with the initial public offering  partially offset by severance costs of million during during  we reduced the number of employees to reflect our anticipated decline in loan origination volumes 
general and administrative expenses increased million and occupancy and equipment expenses increased million 
income taxes 
for and  we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for reflects the impact of timing differences related to the recognition of losses on the residual interest in securitization  the impact of nondeductible compensation expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering and the impact of a related discrete tax item 
our effective tax benefit rate for includes two significant items  approximately million relating to the impact of nondeductible compensation expense incurred in connection with our initial public offering and million resulting from the non recognition of certain state tax benefits primarily resulting from the phase out of our structured products group  including losses incurred on securities sold in our second quarter off balance sheet transaction 
as of december  and we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining that no valuation allowance was needed at december  examples of positive and negative evidence considered include our recent history of paying taxes  trends in our earnings  positive financial ratios including levels of capital that we believe are sufficient to withstand the current economic environment  and the impact of the downturn in the current economic environment including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses  and the impact on funding levels on the company 
we also considered in our assessment the level of income taxes paid in previous periods 
we considered the carryback potential in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
we had pre tax income of million for the year ended december   and net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and included in these amounts are expenses related to the ipo of million in additionally  results reflect the sale of the majority of its structured products securities and loans to a third party in june  which resulted in a loss of million  in addition to million of previously incurred impairment losses 
subsequent to december   we discontinued the origination of structured products 
we hold one investment security available for sale at december  with a carrying value of million related to structured products 
we noted that these factors  which drove the losses in and  reflect positive evidence when added back to pre tax income 
additionally  we evaluated our business plans and results during our forecast period of future taxable income 
such consideration included liquidity  earnings results including anticipated level of credit losses over a reasonable period of time  available sources of funding and capital from existing sources 
our forecast utilized in our december  analysis included a sufficient level of earnings over a reasonable period of time 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations  credit facilities  term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity and debt offerings 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our current operations  lending activities and other short term liquidity needs 
our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily based on the credit performance of our loan portfolio and origination volume 
we may need to raise additional capital through the incurrence of indebtedness or issuance of equity based on various factors  including if the level of non accrual loans increases faster than expected  we are unable to fund certain loans with credit facilities  or if our cash flow from operations is lower than expected 
we may not be able to raise debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all 
the incurrence of additional debt will increase our leverage and interest expense  and the issuance of any debt or equity securities may be dilutive for existing shareholders 
we continue to experience higher costs of borrowing and pressure to reduce leverage 
credit facility renewals and amendments to existing credit facilities in were  and we expect they will continue to be  more expensive and at lower committed amounts and provide lower advance rates than similar transactions we completed in prior periods 
reduction in advance rates under our warehouse credit facilities in and have resulted in or  in the case of our recent amendment to our citicorp facility  will require the use of cash to repay advances 
lower committed amounts under our credit facilities will limit our ability to borrow funds to support future loan growth 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
we may invest a portion of cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
from time to time  we may use a portion of our non restricted cash to pay down our credit facilities 
restricted cash separately  we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in our restricted cash balance is primarily due to restrictions on when we could repay outstanding amounts under the deutsche bank ag  new york branch term debt facility 
we paid off all outstanding borrowings under this facility with the proceeds received from the term debt securitization completed on january  the restricted cash represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre funding amounts in our credit facilities  our term debt securitizations and customer holdbacks and escrows 
the use of the principal collection accounts cash is limited to funding the growth of our loan portfolio within the facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations 
the interest collection account cash is limited to the payment of interest  servicing fees and other expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and  if either a ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the funding period or if coverage ratios are not met  paying down principal with respect thereto 
cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash balance at december  asset quality and allowance for loan losses if a loan is days or more past due  or if management believes it is probable we will unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business  it is our policy to place the loan on non accrual status 
if a loan financed by a term debt securitization is placed on non accrual status  the loan may remain in the term debt securitization and excess interest spread cash distributions to us will cease until cash accumulated in the term debt securitization equals the outstanding balance of the non accrual loan 
when a loan is on non accrual status  accrued interest previously recognized as interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed  and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until 
table of contents factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and is in the process of collection 
as of december   we had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million 
twenty eight of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructurings as defined by asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
nineteen of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million were on non accrual status 
fourteen of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million were greater than days past due and classified as delinquent 
during  we recorded million of specific provisions for impaired loans 
included in our specific allowance for impaired loans was million related to delinquent loans 
moreover  the economic recession has led to a decline in overall credit quality across the market 
we are closely monitoring the credit quality of our loans 
we may experience additional loan delinquencies  losses  specific reserves  non accruals  troubled debt restructurings and charge offs due to current economic conditions and as our portfolio continues to season 
despite our limited historical loss experience  we have provided an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
we seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
as such  we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities 
under the interest rate swap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of operations 
under the interest rate cap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between a specified fixed interest the cap and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount  but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate 
the interest rate caps currently are not matched to specific assets or liabilities and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we also offer a fixed rate loan program to certain of our customers which utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and interest rate collars 
we provide floating interest rate debt to our customers  and to reduce default risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into interest rate swap  cap and collar contracts with these customers 
subsequently  we may enter into similar offsetting contracts with third parties  or customer derivatives 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges  including any cash payments made or received  are reported as gain loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in the company s interest payments on libor indexed debt

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers 
these financial instruments include unfunded commitments  standby letters of credit and interest rate mitigation products 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management s credit evaluation of the borrower and the borrower s compliance with financial covenants 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be required to fund our unfunded commitments 
the aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments currently exceeds our available funds and will likely continue to exceed our available funds in the future 
at december   we had million of unused lines of credit 
of these unused lines of credit  unfunded commitments related to revolving credit facilities were million and unfunded commitments related to delayed draw term loans were million 
million of the unused commitments are unavailable to the borrowers  which may be related to the borrowers inability to meet covenant obligations or other similar events 
revolving credit facilities allow our borrowers to draw up to a specified amount subject to customary borrowing conditions 
the unfunded revolving commitments of million are further categorized as either contingent or unrestricted 
contingent commitments limit a borrower s ability to access the revolver unless it meets an enumerated borrowing base covenant or other restrictions 
at december   we categorized million of the unfunded commitments related to revolving credit facilities as contingent 
unrestricted commitments represent commitments that are currently accessible  assuming the borrower is in compliance with certain customary loan terms and conditions 
at december   we had million of unfunded unrestricted revolving commitments 
during the three months ended december   revolver usage averaged approximately  which is consistent with historical usage over the past year 
management s experience indicates that borrowers typically do not seek to exercise their entire available line of credit at any point in time 
delayed draw credit facilities allow our borrowers to draw predefined amounts of the approved loan commitment at contractually set times  subject to specific conditions  such as capital expenditures in corporate loans or for tenant improvements in commercial real estate loans 
borrowers drew million from these credit facilities during standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers 
at december  we had million of standby letters of credit 

table of contents interest rate risk mitigation products are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and risk management objectives 
derivative financial instruments consist predominantly of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors 
the interest rate risks to the company of these customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties 
at december   the notional value of the interest rate mitigation products was million 
on june   we completed the sale of securities and loans totaling million  including million of rmbs holdings to a non recourse  off balance sheet financing vehicle and recognized a million loss on the sale 
we retained a residual interest in the assets sold  which had a fair value of at december  our valuation of the residual involves two basic assumptions i a forecast of cash flows from the underlying collateral  and ii a discount rate applied to those cash flows

changes in the fair value of the residual interest are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on our financial statements  are considered critical accounting policies 
the following are our critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is based on a loan by loan build up of inherent losses on loans  gross 
we also maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments  namely loan commitments and letters of credit that are reported in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the combined balance of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   we had an allowance for credit losses of million  with specific allowances totaling million 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  a base allowance is provided for loans that are not impaired 
the company employs a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk  which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans 
the company s allowance framework addresses economic conditions  capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top down and bottom up perspective 
the company considers and evaluates changes in economic conditions  credit availability  industry and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
on at least a quarterly basis  loans are internally risk rated based on individual credit criteria  including loan type  loan structures including balloon and bullet structures common in the company s middle market corporate and commercial real estate cash flow loans  borrower industry  payment capacity  location and quality of collateral if any including the company s commercial real estate loans 
borrowers provide the company with financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis 
ratings  corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition or profile 
for middle market corporate loans  the data set used to construct probabilities of default in its allowance for loan losses model  moody s crd private firm database  principally contains middle market corporate loans that share attributes similar to the company s loans 
the company also considers the quality of the loan terms in determining a loan loss in the event of default 

table of contents for commercial real estate loans  the company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions 
first  a loan s risk rating  and thereby its assumed default likelihood  can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions 
second  to the extent that economic or industry trends adversely affect a borrower s loan to value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability  the company applies a stress multiplier to the loan s probability of default 
the multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline 
additionally  when determining the amount of the general allowance  the company supplements the base amount with a judgmental amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of ten individually weighted risk factors 
the risk factors are designed based on those outlined in the comptrollers of the currency s allowance for loan and lease losses handbook 
the company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money center banks  regional banks and finance companies 
while the company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for credit losses  it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonable check on the allowance for credit losses computation 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment of a loan is based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
impaired loans are identified based on the loan by loan risk rating process described above 
it is the company s policy that during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
as of december   we had impaired loans 
impaired loans at december  were in both commercial real estate and in middle market corporate  over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following buildings and commercial real estate  healthcare  broadcast and entertainment  nondurable consumer products  energy and chemical services  industrial and other business services 
for impaired middle market corporate loans  the company measured impairment based on expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability 
such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms 
for impaired commercial real estate loans  the company determined that the loans were collateral dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third party appraisers  as well as internal estimates of market value 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
the provision for credit losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
in performing these reviews we make estimates about future profits and tax planning strategies that would affect future taxable income and the realization of these deferred tax assets 
a change in these assumptions could result in a difference in valuation and impact our results of operations 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to our deferred tax asset 

table of contents on january   the company adopted asc formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
a company can only recognize the tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be upheld on audit  based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
asc also addresses how interest and penalties should be accrued for uncertain tax positions  requiring that interest expense should be recognized in the first period interest would be accrued under the tax law 
the company classifies all interest and penalties on recognized tax benefits as a part of income tax expense 
at january   the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties 
at december   the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits  and there have been no material changes since adoption 
the company does not expect any significant changes within the next months 
the company files us federal and state income tax returns 
as of december   the company s tax returns for the years ended  and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service and state tax authorities 
fair value the company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
asc  fair value measurements asc differentiates between those assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value at every reporting period recurring and those assets and liabilities that are only required to be adjusted to fair value under certain circumstances nonrecurring 
cash and cash equivalents  investments in debt securities  available for sale  residual interest in securitization and derivatives are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale and loans held for investment 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
further  the notes to the consolidated financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities and the valuation methodologies used 
asc  fair value measurements asc establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  it is the company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in asc when available  the company utilizes quoted market prices to measure 
table of contents fair value 
if market prices are not available  fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves  prepayment speeds  option volatilities and other assumptions 
however  in certain cases  when market observable inputs for model based valuation techniques may not be readily available  the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument 
the models used by the company to determine fair value adjustments are periodically evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 
as of december   of total assets and of the assets we measured at fair value used significant unobservable inputs level assets 
during we recognized losses of million in earnings and a gain of million in other comprehensive income related to changes in fair value of these level assets 
the table below sets forth information regarding our level assets as of december  description fair value at december  in thousands commercial loans  net commercial real estate other real estate owned investments in debt securities  available for sale securities backed by licenses and easements warrants and equity linked products total level assets at fair value revenue recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loan and debt product 
the accrual of interest on loans and other debt products is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due by days or more or when  in the opinion of management  it is probable we will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business 
if loans are placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
interest income on non accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible 
nonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans and other debt products are deferred and netted against balances outstanding 
the net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using a method which approximates the effective interest method 
in connection with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product  a partial amount of the remaining unamortized net deferred fees  costs  premiums or discounts are accelerated and recognized as interest income 
the amortization of fees is discontinued on non accrual loans 
depending on the terms of a loan or other debt product  we may charge a prepayment fee and recognize it in the period of the prepayment 
we

syndication  arrangement and structuring fees are recognized in the period the service is completed as a component of non interest income 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted asc formerly sfas revised  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we adopted asc using the prospective method 
for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january   we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected term and expected price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock based compensation and the related expense to be recognized 
we expect the changes in our stock price during will impact our price volatility assumption and could result in an adverse affect to our financial statements 
further  for awards that contain performance measures and conditions  we make an assessment  based on management s judgment  of the probability of these conditions being satisfied  which affects the timing and the amount of expense to be recognized 
if our judgment as to whether these conditions are probable of occurrence are not appropriate  the financial statements could be materially affected 
valuation of investments in debt securities we review the fair value of our other debt products quarterly 
the fair value of our investments in debt securities  non investment grade securities and residual securities  are based on independent third party quoted market prices  when available  at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
when no market is available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis and internally generated financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments  as well as qualitative factors 
even if the general accuracy of our valuation models are validated  there are no assurances that our valuations are accurate because of the high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures  which differ on each securitization 
valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of these assets 
a debt product is considered impaired when the fair value of the debt product declines below its amortized cost 
the cost basis of the investment is then written down to fair value 
if management determines the impairment to be temporary  it is recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if management determines the impairment to be other than temporary  it is recorded as an offset to other income on our statements of operations 
from time to time we may become aware of cash flow or credit issues with respect to our other debt products and these other debt products are then monitored by management to determine if a write down is appropriate 
although we view write downs of our other debt products as a normal and anticipated aspect of our business  material write downs of the fair value of our other debt products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our allowance for credit losses does not cover write downs because we classify these assets as available for sale and are accounted for under the guidelines of asc 
table of contents in the past  we invested in the rmbs market and were exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying these investment securities 
during  we sold million of our rmbs debt products to an off balance sheet financing vehicle please see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding residual interest 
as of december   we had completely written off our remaining rmbs debt products 
the performance of our investment securities may be negatively impacted by  among other things  the timing of losses  higher than expected levels of credit losses or prepayment speeds on the underlying mortgages or home equity loans  depending on the specific structure of each securitization 
most of our investments are in classes of securities which are not actively traded in secondary markets or have lower levels of liquidity 
the fair value of securities and other investments that have such liquidity characteristics may not be readily ascertained 
this situation may be further exacerbated by current market conditions 
the description of certain instruments as debt securities is intended to describe the accounting treatment of those instruments and is not a characterization of those instruments as securities for any other purpose 
valuation of residual interest in securitization the fair value of our residual interest is based on forecasted cash flows  discount rates  expected credit losses and prepayment speeds for the individual loans and securities 
we recognize changes in the fair value of the residual interest as gains or losses on our statement of operations 
in addition  the fair value determined at any time may not be accurate due to a high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures 
our determination of fair value will be highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our internal cash flow model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that currently may not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the residual interest  and the differences could be material 
our assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows on the individual assets may be higher or lower than those that might be employed by a third party 
to value the assets  we use historical performance data at the time of determination and assumptions about delinquencies  losses  severities and prepayment speeds in the future  including assumptions about the timing of these variables  in arriving at estimates of future cash flows on the individual assets 
these assumptions are influenced by historical experience in the respective asset classes and with particular originations and servicers 
within the various rmbs asset classes  assumptions and methodologies used by us are generally consistent among the various assets within each class and generally consistent with past forecasting techniques used by us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in market values of our loans held for sale  which are carried at lower of cost or market  and our investment in debt securities  available for sale and derivatives  which are carried at fair value 
fair value is defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives  fair value is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
where a market quotation is not readily available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis  as well as qualitative factors 
as of december  and  investments in debt securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our net unrealized loss on those debt securities totaled million and million  respectively 
any unrealized gain or loss on these investments is included in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet  until realized 
interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us 
our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect our net interest income 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
during the normal course of business our lending to clients and our investments in debt securities create some interest rate risk as does the impact of ever changing market conditions 
our management attempts to mitigate this risk through our asset liability committee alco process taking into consideration balance sheet dynamics such as loan and investment growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and maturity characteristics 
the alco group reviews the overall rate risk position and strategy on an ongoing basis 
the alco group also reviews the impact on net interest income caused by changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as parallel shifts in the yield curve 
the following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of december  our modeling is based on contractual terms and does not consider prepayment rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months in thousands decrease of increase of as shown above  we estimate to the best of our ability that a decrease in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase of million in our annualized net interest income  and an increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our net interest income of million 
the estimated changes in net interest income reflect the potential effect of interest rate floors on loans totaling approximately million 
if interest rates rise  the potential impact from interest rate floors would decrease resulting in lower net interest income 
the cost of our variable rate debt would increase  while interest income from loans with interest rate floors would not change until interest rates exceed the stated rate of the interest rate floors
