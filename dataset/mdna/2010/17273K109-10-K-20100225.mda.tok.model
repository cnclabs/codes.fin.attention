item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act  and foreign equivalents of such laws 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities and we also incurred and expensed an additional million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we also expect to capitalize million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  and also expect to incur and expense charges of approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  item a 
risk factors certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur our leslie controls  inc subsidiary is subject to asbestos related litigation that could ultimately have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
as more fully described in part i  item legal proceedings  our leslie subsidiary has been and continues to be named as a defendant in asbestos related product liability actions 
the actual amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the numbers of trials and settlements 
as of december   leslie has a recorded liability of million net of anticipated insurance recoveries of million  for the estimated indemnity cost associated with recorded resolution of its current open claims and future claims anticipated to be filed during the next five years 
although leslie believes this estimate is reasonable  such estimate also is highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history is relatively recent and variable 
as a result  the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
in addition  while future claims beyond the five year forecast period are probable  leslie s management cannot estimate the losses that may arise from such additional future claims and we  therefore  have not accrued a liability for such additional future claims 
moreover  because we have factored the full amount of our remaining primary layer insurance limits into our accruals for the indemnity cost of resolving current open claims  and because leslie has only limited available excess layer coverage  leslie will be responsible for a substantial majority of indemnity costs associated with future claims 

table of contents leslie also incurs significant costs in defending asbestos claims and we record these costs at the time incurred 
historically  leslie s primary insurers have paid a majority of its defense costs 
however  while leslie does have some primary layer coverage remaining  leslie now pays approximately of its defense costs  and  if leslie consummates an agreement currently proposed with one of its primary layer carriers  leslie s share of defense costs will increase to 
moreover  leslie anticipates that the percentage of defense costs that it must bear will increase once primary insurance layer is completely exhausted  since leslie has only limited available excess layer coverage 
a significant increase beyond our estimates in the cost to leslie of resolving current and future claims  or a significant increase in the cost of defending current and future asbestos claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we  therefore  refer the reader to and incorporate by reference part i  item captioned legal proceedings in this annual report on form k and to part i  item i captioned legal proceedings in our periodic filings on form q which provides more specific information regarding leslie s asbestos litigation and insurance situation 
we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in addition  decreased market demand typically results in excess manufacturing capacity among our competitors which  in turn  results in pricing pressure 
as a consequence  a significant downturn in our markets can result in lower profit margins 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns or anticipated downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we  along with our customers and vendors  face the uncertainty in the public and private credit markets and in general economic conditions in the united states and around the world 
the public and private capital and credit markets in the united states and around the world continue to experience significant volatility  disruption and general slowdown at unprecedented levels 
this has spawned an unprecedented deterioration in many industrial markets including several of the markets into which we sell our products 
the breadth  depth and duration of these conditions remains uncertain 
these conditions can adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and overall financial growth 
our business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical  economic and business conditions and conditions in the financial services market  which each could materially impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  capital resources and liquidity 
additionally  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets for new financing in the short term  a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long term operational and capital needs or could limit our ability in the future to consummate strategic acquisitions 
the current uncertainty in the credit markets may also negatively impact the ability of our customers and vendors to finance their operations which  in turn  could result in a decline in our sales and in our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and components  thus potentially having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a resurgence of terrorist activity around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses 

table of contents in the past  terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions have improved considerably  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current conflicts in iraq  afganistan and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
commencing in and continuing in  we embarked on a company wide program to implement lean manufacturing techniques 
we believe that this process will produce meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  implementation of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to successfully implement these processes our anticipated profitability may suffer 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary energy  aerospace  and flow technology products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them and may result in an impairment charge 
in addition  acquisitions may 
table of contents involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we cannot pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers cannot provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate those customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
in recent years  we have enhanced our dependence on lower cost foreign sources of raw materials  components  and  in some cases  completed product 
managing a geographically diverse supply base inherently poses significant logistical challenges 
while we believe that we also have improved our ability to effectively manage a global supply base  a risk nevertheless exists that we could experience diminished supplier performance resulting in longer than expected lead times and or product quality issues 
the incurrence of such factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 

table of contents we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in its report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 

table of contents various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or with respect to passive investors or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our outstanding industrial revenue bond and our revolving credit facility agreement dated july  govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock continues to be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be  and has been volatile in the past 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
while we attempt in our public disclosures to provide forward looking information in order to enable investors to anticipate our future performance  such information by its nature represents our good faith forecasting efforts 
the unprecedented nature of the recent credit crisis and economic recession  together with the uncertain depth and duration of these crises  has rendered such forecasting more difficult 
as a result  our actual results could differ materially from our forecasts which could cause further volatility in the value of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has in the past two years experienced dramatic price deterioration and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions

we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends and by successful implementation of our on going lean manufacturing initiatives 
item legal proceedings asbestos litigation background like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  our subsidiary leslie  which we acquired in  has been and continues to be named as a defendant in product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as alleged successor in interest in these cases 
as of the end of fiscal  leslie was a named defendant in approximately  active  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in california  texas  new york  massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island  illinois and other states 
approximately of these claims involve claimants allegedly suffering from or the estates of decedents who allegedly died from mesothelioma  a fatal malignancy associated with asbestos exposure 
in addition to these claims  leslie remains a named defendant in approximately  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in mississippi 
since  however  the mississippi supreme court has interpreted joinder rules more strictly  and the state legislature enacted a tort reform act under which each plaintiff must independently satisfy venue provisions  thus preventing thousands of out of state claimants from tagging onto a single in state plaintiff s case 
as a result of these changes  mississippi state court judges since have severed and dismissed tens of thousands of out of state asbestos claims against numerous defendants including leslie 
we continue to expect that most of the remaining mississippi claims against leslie will be dismissed as well 
leslie has not incurred any indemnity costs in mississippi and defense costs to resolve these mississippi claims have not been significant 
while it is possible that certain dismissed claims could be re filed in mississippi or in other jurisdictions  any such re filings likely would be made on behalf of one or a small number of related individuals who could demonstrate actual injury and some connection to leslie s products 
consequently  leslie does not factor these mississippi filings into its claims reporting and valuation analyses 
leslie s asbestos related claims generally involve its fluid control products 
leslie management believes that any asbestos was incorporated entirely within the product in a way that would not allow for any ambient asbestos during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
leslie and its insurers general strategy has been to vigorously defend these claims 
nevertheless  while we strongly believe that exposure to leslie s products has not caused asbestos related illness to any plaintiff  juries or courts have reached a different conclusion in particular cases and could do so in others 

table of contents leslie has resolved a number of asbestos related claims over the past few years and continues to do so for strategic reasons  including avoidance of defense costs and the possible risk of excessive verdicts 
the amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year are generally impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the number of trials and settlements 
during  los angeles state court juries rendered two verdicts that  if allowed to stand  would result in a liability to leslie of approximately million 
although leslie accrued a liability during for each of these verdicts  both verdicts were appealed and  during november  the california court of appeals issued its final ruling reversing one of the two judgments against leslie 
as a result of this ruling  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the accrued liability associated with leslie s asbestos claims by million 
with respect to the remaining verdict  appellate arguments have not yet been scheduled  however  we continue to believe there are strong grounds for overturning this verdict  or for significantly reducing the amount of the award or requiring a new trial 
leslie has recorded million in accrued interest for the remaining outstanding adverse verdict 
accounting indemnity and defense cost liabilities and assets leslie records an estimated liability associated with reported asbestos claims when it believes that a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
prior to the fourth quarter of  with respect to its unresolved pending claims  leslie did not believe that it had sufficient information to assess the likelihood of resolving such claims 
accordingly  leslie accrued for defense costs as incurred  and accrued for pending claims only when resolution of a particular claim was probable and the probable loss was estimable 
as a practical matter  the claims accrual generally occurred close in time to when a settlement agreement for a particular claim was reached 
in most cases  settlement payments are paid to claimants within thirty to sixty days of settlement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we engaged hamilton  rabinovitz and associates  inc hr a  a firm specializing in estimating expected liabilities of mass tort claims  to help us determine an estimate of leslie s asbestos related liabilities 
because leslie s claims experience was both limited and variable  hr a concluded that any estimate of pending or future liabilities of leslie s asbestos claims would be highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
leslie s management determined  however  that  by using its historical albeit limited and variable average cost by disease classification in resolving closed claims  and by applying this information to the mix of current open claims  it could make a reasonable estimate of the indemnity costs to be incurred in resolving such current open claims 
as a result  leslie recorded an initial liability of million during the fourth quarter of for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its then open claims 
based on leslie s discussions with hr a regarding the impact of additional claims data on hr a s conclusion regarding estimating future claim liabilities  leslie requested that hr a update its analysis annually to determine whether such additional data warranted any change to hr a s analyses and conclusions regarding future estimation 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  hr a updated its analysis and reaffirmed its conclusion  at that time  that a forecast of the number and value of any future asbestos claims was unwarranted and highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
however  when again updating its analysis at management s request during the fourth quarter of  hr a concluded that leslie now had claims experience sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated not only with leslie s open asbestos claims but also with respect to future claims 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  leslie recorded an additional million to its asbestos liability accrual for the estimated indemnity costs associated with future claims anticipated to be filed during the next five years 
in determining the estimated liability associated with such future filings  hr a first determined an estimate of the number of asbestos cases to be filed against leslie during the next five years by applying leslie s historical claims experience to the nicholson kpmg model a generally accepted epidemiological model that predicts the incurrence of asbestos related illnesses 
hr a then determined an estimate of the liability associated with resolution of such claims by applying an appropriate average cost per case resolution by disease 
leslie s estimated future claims liability was not discounted because the timing of payments is not fixed and reasonably estimable 
asbestos related defense costs continue to be expensed as incurred and are not included in any future claim reserves 
while it is probable that additional asbestos filings will be made against leslie beyond the five year period covered by hr a s estimate  leslie believes that any further estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss associated with such filings beyond five years would be highly uncertain 
projecting future asbestos related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received and variability in the jurisdictions in which such claims are filed  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in the claims  funds available in post bankruptcy trusts  changes in the governing law and other uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 

table of contents these trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system 
moreover  because these factors do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods  any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty of projecting future liability costs  leslie does not believe the reasonably possible loss  or range of reasonably possible loss  associated with future filings beyond five years is estimable at the current time 
accordingly  no accrual has been recorded with respect to any liability associated with future filings anticipated to be made beyond such five year period 
as of december   leslie has recorded asbestos liabilities for resolution of pending and future claims anticipated to be filed through the next five years of million million short term and million long term compared to million as of december  the million liability as of december  is comprised of million for the estimated cost of resolving those future claims filed during the next five years  million for the estimated cost of resolving existing claims  million related to the remaining adverse verdict on appeal  and million for incurred but unpaid legal costs 
asbestos related insurance receivable amounts totaled million all short term as of december  compared to million as of december  the million receivable as of december  is comprised of million for existing claims  million related to adverse verdict and million for incurred but unpaid legal costs 
a summary of leslie s accrued liabilities for existing and future asbestos claims as well as incurred but unpaid asbestos defense cost liabilities and the related insurance recoveries is provided below 
as of december in thousands existing claim indemnity liability future claim indemnity liability incurred defense cost liability insurance recoveries receivable net asbestos liability although leslie believes its estimates are reasonable  such estimates are also highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history remains relatively recent and variable 
depending on future events  and  in particular  changes in the trend factors set forth above  the actual costs of resolving these pending and future claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
as a result of these factors  leslie is unable to estimate a range of additional losses that may result from higher than estimated claim rates or higher than estimated indemnity costs for resolving pending and future claims 
moreover  leslie management believes that appellate activity currently pending in certain jurisdictions such as california  together with movements toward legislative and judicial reform in such jurisdictions  may significantly alter the litigation landscape  thus affecting both the rate at which claims may be filed as well as the level of indemnity that may be incurred to resolve such claims 
experience and financial statement impact during  there were asbestos claims filed and claims resolved with respect to leslie 
for the year ended december   leslie s gross asbestos indemnity and defense costs totaled million of which million was paid by insurance 
leslie s insurance coverage is further discussed below 
the million includes a million non cash charge for future claims as discussed above and compares to million gross asbestos indemnity and defense costs paid in of which million was paid by insurance 
the following tables provide more specific information regarding leslie s claim activity and defense costs during each of the three years ended december    and as well as the financial impact of the asbestos litigation on the company for such periods excluding open mississippi cases for which we anticipate dismissal of virtually all such cases for the reasons described above for the year ended december beginning open claims claims filed claims resolved and dismissed ending open claims ending open mesothelioma claims 
table of contents for the year ended december in thousands indemnity costs accrued filed cases five year future indemnity cost accrued adverse verdict interest costs verdict appealed defense cost incurred insurance recoveries adjustment insurance recoveries accrued net pre tax asbestos expense insurance historical to date  leslie s insurers have paid the majority of the costs associated with its defense and settlement of asbestos related actions 
under leslie s cost sharing arrangements with its insurers  leslie s insurers  through  paid of defense and settlement costs associated with asbestos related claims and leslie was responsible for the remaining of all such defense and indemnity costs 
the amount of indemnity available under leslie s primary layer of insurance coverage was therefore reduced by of any amounts paid through settlement or verdict during this period 
recent developments during the first quarter of  zurich  an insurer that paid of leslie s historical asbestos defense and indemnity costs  reached its maximum indemnity obligation under the applicable insurance policy 
as a result  leslie is now responsible for the share previously paid by zurich 
also during the first quarter of  one of leslie s other primary insurers  continental casualty  a cna company continental  informed leslie that indemnity payments had exhausted a three year policy covering leslie from through in so claiming  continental expressed its belief that the policy in question contained a single aggregate limit of million for the three year period rather than annual limits of million for each of the three years 
as a result of the revised claimed coverage limit  continental believed that its allocation under the cost sharing arrangement should be compared to the historically paid by continental 
leslie strongly disagreed with continental s position and informed continental of its intention to vigorously dispute continental s position 
however  in light of the uncertainty surrounding this dispute  leslie reduced its insurance recovery receivable by million in the first quarter of during the first quarter of fiscal  leslie and continental have been discussing a proposed agreement to settle the dispute regarding continental s remaining defense and indemnity obligations for a lump sum settlement payment 
because the proposed settlement with continental includes a complete buyout of continental s responsibilities under the subject policies  leslie  if the proposed agreement is consummated  would then also be responsible for continental s share of defense costs going forward  thus raising leslie s responsibility for defense costs to 
remaining insurance as of december   we believe that the aggregate amount of indemnity on a cash basis remaining on leslie s primary layer of insurance was approximately million 
after giving effect to our accrual for the adverse verdict currently on appeal  the remaining amount of leslie s primary layer of insurance is approximately million 
from a financial statement perspective  however  after giving effect to our accrual for the estimated indemnity cost of resolving pending claims  leslie recorded the maximum amount of available primary layer insurance as of september as a result  asbestos related indemnity costs are no longer partially offset by a corresponding insurance recovery 
however  defense costs  which are recognized as incurred  will continue to be partially offset by a contribution from leslie s remaining primary layer carrier until such time as the aggregate amount of indemnity claims paid out on a cash basis by the remaining primary layer insurance carrier exceeds policy limits 
depending upon the ultimate resolution of the dispute with continental  there could be additional recovery of some defense costs 
while we cannot reasonably predict when leslie s primary layer will be fully exhausted  if leslie s rate of settlements were to continue at a pace consistent with the past two years  and  assuming no payments on account of any adverse verdicts  policy limits would be reached within approximately one year 
if  however  leslie were to be required to make payments on account of an adverse verdict  the time period within which such policy limits would be reached could be less than one year 
in addition to its primary layer of insurance  leslie does have some available excess insurance coverage 
however  some of this excess insurance lies above layers of excess insurance written by insolvent insurers which could affect when leslie may be able to recover this excess insurance 
moreover  unlike primary policies under which defense costs do not erode policy limits  the terms of 
table of contents excess policies typically provide that covered defense costs do erode policy limits 
based on analysis performed by its insurance counsel  leslie estimates that it may be able to recover from its excess carriers approximately million associated with defense and resolution of its pending asbestos claims and those claims anticipated to be filed during the next five years 
because the probability and amount of such recovery is uncertain  however  leslie has not accrued an insurance receivable for such recovery as of december  in addition  despite the availability of such excess insurance  upon exhaustion of its primary layer of insurance  leslie may be required to bear an even greater share of indemnity and defense costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  consolidated results of operations  and consolidated cash flows 
expected limitations and other matters we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
smaller numbers of asbestos related claims have also been filed against two of our other subsidiaries spence  the stock of which we acquired in  and hoke  the stock of which we acquired in due to the nature of the products supplied by these entities  the markets they serve and our historical experience in resolving these claims  we do not believe that asbestos related claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of spence or hoke  or the financial condition  consolidated results of operations or liquidity of the company

table of contents overview circor international  inc provides valves and other highly engineered products and subsystems that allow customers around the world to use fluid safely and efficiently in the instrumentation  thermal fluid  aerospace and energy markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
our global brands are sold to more than  customers in over countries through approximately  distributors and our own sales force 
we also have a broad and established manufacturing footprint and are focused on enhancing our supply chain capability 
during the fourth quarter of  we realigned our business segment reporting structure including comparative historical financial data into three segments energy  aerospace  and flow technologies 
the realignment was the result of changes in our internal organization regarding the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance 
the principal change was to divide the previously reported instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment into two segments aerospace and flow technologies 
accordingly  business information for the prior periods has been restated to conform to the current presentation 
the realignment did not affect our consolidated  net income  balance sheets or cash flows for any of the periods presented 
the energy segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
the aerospace segment primarily serves military and commercial aerospace  transportation and medical equipment markets 
the flow technologies segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including chemical processing  marine  power generation  commercial hvac systems  petroleum and gas processing and refining  and other general industrial markets 
the key elements of our growth strategy are to grow organically by investing in new products  adding value to products  and increasing development of mission critical subsystems  improve the profitability of our business  acquire complementary businesses or technologies  leverage lean manufacturing to enhance margins as well as capture market share through better product performance and faster lead times  and enhance global supply chain capability by expanding our presence in china  india and other developing regions regarding our financial results  we had revenues of million  a decrease over with double digit drops in both the flow technologies and energy segments and a increase in the aerospace segment 
our net income was million and our diluted earnings were a profit of per share 
was a challenging year with macroeconomic factors impacting global credit markets  volatility in oil and gas prices  large variations in global currencies and general weakness in most of our markets 
during  we worked very hard across the company to improve profitability by employing various actions including freezing wages  reducing headcount in excess of excluding acquisition additions  reducing expenses and closing facilities 
at the same time we continued to invest in our key strategic initiatives including supply chain and growth initiatives in india  adding a vice president of corporate development to our management team  executing on acquisitions  as well as the expansion and maturity of the circor business system by expanding our model lines  adding talent in continuous improvement  and deploying global problem solving education and application 
asbestos costs  which are associated with our leslie subsidiary in the flow technologies segment  increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase is attributed to a non cash charge of million taken during the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the indemnity liability associated with resolution of future claims to be filed during the next five years 
we enter with caution 
although we have seen some growth in the energy markets during the fourth quarter of and oil and gas prices appear to have stabilized  we are not sure how long this will last 
in addition  we see some weaknesses or lack of growth in most of our other end markets 
consequently we are planning our operational expenses and activities at levels similar to the fourth quarter of at the same time  we are continuing to dedicate resources to pursuing and achieving certain strategic deployment objectives which  we believe  will enable us to grow and improve profitability during and post these uncertain times 
our strategic goals include but are not limited to  enhancing our manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities in emerging growth countries such as india  china and brazil  investing in talent development of high potential employees  and continuing to drive continuous improvement throughout all of our operations and processes 
in addition  we are continuing our efforts to identify and pursue strategic acquisition candidates 

table of contents regarding cash flow in  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  or of revenues  a decrease of million compared to million generated in the decrease from resulted primarily from lower profitability compared to we also used million of cash for investing activities and million in financing activities 
as of december   we believe we remain a well capitalized company with total debt to total shareholders equity of 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in three segments energy  aerospace and flow technologies 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
there have been no significant changes from the methodology applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts on deposit in checking and savings accounts with banks and other financial institutions 
in  short term investments primarily consist of guaranteed investment certificates and in consisted of bank repurchase agreements which generally have short term maturities and are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
allowance for inventory we typically analyze our inventory aging and projected future usage on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our inventory allowances 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured on an item by item basis determined based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value 
the provision for inventory allowance is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand are among the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 

table of contents penalty accruals some of our customer agreements  primarily in our project related businesses  contain late shipment penalty clauses whereby we are contractually obligated to pay consideration to our customers if we do not meet specified shipment dates 
the accrual for estimated penalties is shown as a reduction of revenue and is based on several factors including limited historical customer settlement experience and management s assessment of specific shipment delay information 
accruals related to these potential late shipment penalties as of the december  and were million and million  respectively 
as we conclude performance under these agreements  the actual amount of consideration paid to our customers may vary significantly from the amounts we currently have accrued 
concentrations of risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
a significant portion of our revenue and receivables are from customers who are either in or service the energy  aerospace  and industrial markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses 
during and  the company has not experienced any significant losses related to the collection of our accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   we had no customers from which we derive revenues that exceed the threshold of of the company s consolidated revenues 
for the same period in  we had one customer in our energy segment that accounted for of the company s consolidated revenues 
acquisition accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence phase and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
our methodology for determining the fair values relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies and we typically utilize third party valuation firms to assist in the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets 
in december  the fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement regarding business combinations 
the purpose of this accounting pronouncement  found under fasb asc topic  is to improve the information provided in financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
the pronouncement requires acquisition date fair value measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquiree 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
the company adopted this standard as of january  and applied it prospectively to business combinations that occurred after adoption 
during march  we acquired the stock of bodet and its affiliate atlas 
during september  we acquired the stock of pipeline engineering 
for more detailed information  refer to note  business acquisitions in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this standard had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition although the new standard has materially changed the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to january  legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item impairment analysis as required by asc topic  goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill and certain intangible assets are impaired 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital 
for the year ended december   we had no goodwill impairments  however  we recognized intangible impairments of million consisting of two trade names within our energy and aerospace segments where estimated future cash flows of these businesses could not support the carrying value of these intangible assets on our balance sheet 
this compares to our year ended december  when we recorded goodwill and intangible impairments of million and million  respectively 
the trade name impairment was recorded in our flow technology segment 

table of contents in late  certain negative macroeconomic factors began to impact the global credit markets and we noted significant adverse trends in business conditions in the fourth quarter of at that time  we identified significant deterioration in the expected future financial performance in most of our businesses within each of our operating segments compared to the expected future financial performance of these segments at the end of we also determined that the appropriate discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital as of december  was significantly higher than the discount rate used in our impairment assessment 
these factors contributed to the goodwill impairment charges we recorded in in  the fair value of each of our operating segments exceeded the respective book value  and no goodwill impairments were recorded 
the fair values utilized for our goodwill assessment exceeded the book value by approximately   and for the energy  aerospace and flow technologies segments  respectively 
in addition  our segment realignment did not affect our conclusion about goodwill impairment 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill and annual impairment analysis 
if our estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million compared with million as of december  the amounts of our non amortizing intangible assets were million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
as a result of the evolving factors associated with leslie s asbestos matters  our outlook of diminished future cash flow for leslie  which is reported in our flow technologies segment  was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of leslie in accordance with asc topic in the fourth quarter as part of our year end closing process  with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  an updated impairment analysis was performed again for leslie 
as part of our year end closing process  we assessed that the fair value of leslie s long lived assets was at least equal to net book value  and no impairment charge was necessary 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and experimental tax credits  domestic manufacturing deduction  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of the million non cash asbestos charge for future claims anticipated over the next five years for which the tax benefit was million 
excluding the non cash asbestos charge and related tax benefit  the effective tax rate would have been 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of an adjustment for goodwill and intangible impairment of million for which the tax basis was million 
excluding the goodwill and impairment charge  the effective tax rate would have been 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax liabilities increased primarily due to acquisition accounting relating to non goodwill intangibles and fixed assets  partially offset by the reversal of prior depreciation differences and amortization of non goodwill intangibles 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to the non cash asbestos charge 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained a total valuation allowance of million at december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of certain foreign tax credits  state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision 
as of december  and december   accrued interest and penalties were million and million respectively 
as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million excluding interest of million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
pension benefits we maintain two pension benefit plans  a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan and a nonqualified  noncontributory defined benefit supplemental plan that provides benefits to certain highly compensated officers and employees 
to date  the supplemental plan remains an unfunded plan 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation 
as of july   in connection with a revision to our retirement plan  we froze the pension benefits of our qualified noncontributory plan participants 
under the revised plan  such participants generally do not accrue any additional benefits under the defined benefit plan after july  and instead receive enhanced benefits associated with our defined contribution k plan in which substantially all of our us employees are eligible to participate 
based on a desire to ensure compliance with section a of the internal revenue service code  during we facilitated a mandatory cash out to all active and terminated employees of the supplemental plan who were not currently receiving benefit payments 
this pension settlement resulted in million of pre tax expense during the year ended december  as required in the recognition and disclosure provisions of asc topic  the company recognizes the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in its balance sheet  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the change in the funded status of the plan is recognized in the year in which the change occurs through other comprehensive income 
these provisions also require plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the company s balance sheet date 
we adopted the measurement provisions of asc topic beginning january  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
assets of our qualified pension plan are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor in the plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for and for the qualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expense for both and was 
for the nonqualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for both and was 
since there was no change in the assumed rate used for versus  there was no impact on our projected benefit obligation or pension expense 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor defined as the threshold above which gains or losses need to be amortized are being recognized over approximately a twenty nine year period for the qualified plan  and a twenty two year period for the nonqualified plan  which represents the weighted average expected remaining life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
the fair value of our defined benefit plans assets at december  was less than the estimated projected benefit obligations 
the fair value of plan assets increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s net pension liability decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and million of cash payments for our non qualified supplemental plan 
in  we expect to make voluntary cash contributions of approximately million to our qualified plan and million in payments for our non qualified plan  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 

table of contents we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future

the organic declines were primarily due to an approximately decline in north american oil and gas drilling and production activities as well as lower revenues from large international and us pipeline equipment projects 
orders for this segment declined million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the continued weakness in north american drilling and production activities resulting from lower oil and natural gas pricing and demand  partially offset by increased orders in large international 
table of contents projects with significant lead times and the addition of pipeline engineering for one quarter 
backlog has declined by million to million as of december  compared to million for the same period in while some de stocking of inventory continues at our distributors  we are cautiously optimistic for the beginning of based on increased rig counts in north america during the fourth quarter of and increased backlog over the third quarter although pricing pressure is expected to continue 
aerospace revenues increased by million  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas as well as the full year input of the may acquisition of motor tech partially offset by organic declines driven by softening markets for commercial aerospace  military and defense in addition to unfavorable currency fluctuations 
orders for this segment declined million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due mainly to the timing military landing gear orders and the lower commercial aerospace orders driven by lower build rates for business jets and reduced commercial spares driven by airline capacity reductions 
order backlog grew to million as of december  compared to december  driven primarily by our recent acquisitions 
at this point  we currently anticipate that most of the aerospace markets will remain flat to slightly down during flow technologies revenues decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this segment s revenues were negatively impacted by organic declines of million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar of million 
the organic decline was broad based  affecting most areas  with the exception of growth in the semi conductor and maritime markets 
this segment s customer orders decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year with weakness in most markets except semi conductor 
order backlog grew slightly to million as of december  compared to million as of december  driven primarily by a large us naval order booked during the fourth quarter of which is not expected to ship until our outlook is cautious for most of our flow technology markets except us naval where we have a strong opening backlog 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in consolidated gross margin of for was a decrease of basis points from gross profit for the energy segment decreased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the gross profit decrease was due primarily to the organic revenue declines in both the north american short cycle business and in large international projects 
in addition gross profit declined million due to lower foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar partially offset by a million increase resulting from the october acquisition of pipeline engineering 
due to the dramatic north american short cycle organic revenue declines and declines in large international projects  we have significantly reduced production to react to the lower demand and to reduce inventory levels 
this loss in operating leverage across many of our businesses  together with unfavorable pricing primarily in large international projects and north american pipeline business due to intensified competition and re quoting activity  were the major drivers in the basis point decline in gross margin to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in gross profit for the aerospace segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this gross profit increase was due primarily to the march acquisitions of bodet and atlas which contributed million  and was offset in part by a reduction from organic declines of million and a decline from foreign currency impacts of million 
the largest components of the basis point decline in gross margins in compared to were due to the lost volume and associated operating leverage  and the margin dilution due to our bodet acquisition which has margins lower than the segment average  partially offset by savings from material prices and productivity projects 
gross profit for the flow technologies segment decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in unfavorable currency fluctuations compared to the us dollar reduced gross profit by million whereas lower organic revenues reduced gross profit by million 
despite the reduction in gross profit  gross margins expanded basis points driven primarily by favorable product mix  savings associated with quality of earnings initiatives  material savings and favorable pricing 
these positives were partially offset by lower volume and associated operating leverage

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy segment decreased or million 
the majority of this decrease was due to the organic declines resulting in lower sales commissions  reduced other selling and general administrative costs  and a reduction of million due to lower foreign exchange rates  primarily for the euro compared to the us dollar 
these declines were partially offset by million incremental costs associated with the pipeline engineering acquisition as well as expenses associated with severance as year over year we reduced the number of employees in this segment in excess of excluding acquisitions and expenses to expand global sales 
we also had facility relocation expenses during the year as we exited two leased facilities 
we do not anticipate significant additional costs associated with the exit of these two facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the aerospace segment increased or million 
the majority of this increase can be attributed to an incremental million resulting from the recent acquisitions of bodet  atlas  and motor tech partially offset by organic declines due to reduced selling and general administrative costs  and a reduction of million due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the flow technologies segment decreased by million or over  which was due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations of million and lower commissions and selling costs 
these reductions were partially offset by expenses associated with severance as year over year we reduced the number of employees in this segment by approximately and expenses associated with facility closures 
we do not anticipate significant additional costs associated this facility closure 
corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower short term incentive and share based compensation partially offset by increased pension expense and investments in supply chain and growth initiatives in india 
asbestos charges  net asbestos charges are associated with our leslie subsidiary in the flow technologies segment 
net asbestos related costs increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase is attributed to a non cash charge of million taken during the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the indemnity costs associated with claims to be filed during the next five years 
the remainder of the increase is comprised of lower insurance recoveries primarily due to the exhaustion of certain insurance policies and due to higher gross defense expenses partially offset by the reversal of an adverse verdict accrued in of million 
for more information on asbestos related litigation  see contingencies  commitments and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item special charges during the twelve months ended december   we recorded special charges recoveries of million  which included a receipt of million we received in relating to a asset sale within our energy segment  a million gain associated with a recent acquisition for fair value of the acquired assets exceeding the consideration transferred  offset by million related to intangible impairment related to two trade names of minor product lines within our aerospace and energy segments 
this compares to million in special charges recorded during which consisted of million of goodwill and intangible impairments and million related to costs associated with the retirement agreement of the company s former cfo

table of contents operating income for the energy segment decreased million  or to a net profit of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in operating margins declined basis points to on a revenue decrease of  compared to the decrease in operating income was due primarily to organic revenue declines across the segment  the associated lost operating leverage  unfavorable pricing in large international projects and costs to reduce our workforce plus facility relocation expenses 
this was partially offset by lower commissions  reduced expenses and increased productivity 
operating income for the aerospace segment increased million  or  to a net profit of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the increased operating income is primarily due to million fewer special charges associated with goodwill and intangible impairments during compared to excluding the impairment impact operating income was basically flat year on year as the benefit of acquisitions of million plus global material and productivity gains were offset primarily by lower volume and associated operating leverage 
operating loss for the flow technologies segment decreased million  or to a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in this operating improvement is due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible impairments of million offset by higher asbestos related costs related to the non cash charge of million estimate of the future indemnity claims to be filed during the next five years 
the decline in operating income after the impact of goodwill and intangible impairment and asbestos related costs was primarily the result of lower volume and associated operating leverage  costs to reduce our workforce and exit facilities partially offset by favorable pricing and savings associated with quality of earnings initiatives 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net  increased million to million for compared to million income in the increase in interest expense  net was primarily due to lower interest on our invested cash and increased borrowing costs on our new revolving credit facility 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million income for the year ended december  compared to million expense in the same period of the difference of million was largely the result of foreign currency fluctuations 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of the tax rate for includes the tax impact of the non cash asbestos charge of million for future claims anticipated over the next five years for which a long term tax benefit of million was recorded 
excluding this non cash charge  the effective tax rate would have been 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of goodwill and intangible impairment charges of million for which the tax basis was million for which a million tax benefit was recorded 
excluding the goodwill and intangible impairment charge  the effective tax rate would have been 
the tax rate excluding the non cash charge decreased from the tax rate excluding the impairment primarily due to higher income in lower tax jurisdictions 
net income loss net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the increase was a result of a million reduction in pre tax special charges during compared to which were comprised primarily of non cash related goodwill and intangible impairment charges 
this increase is partially offset by decreased profitability of both the energy and flow technologies segments 
the energy segment reduction was primarily due to the large revenue decline while the flow technologies segment reduction is mostly attributed to increased asbestos costs associated with the non cash charge taken during the fourth quarter of related to future indemnity costs associated with claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years

new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas 
with the issuance of sfas  the fasb standards codification codification becomes the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards applicable for all 
table of contents non governmental entities  with the exception of guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but changes the referencing of financial standards and is intended to simplify user access to authoritative us gaap  by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ended after september  as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it will not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement found under accounting standards codification asc topic regarding subsequent events formerly sfas which defines a date through which management must evaluate subsequent events  and lists the circumstances under which an entity must recognize and disclose events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this standard as of june  and it had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we have evaluated all subsequent events through february  in september  the fasb issued an accounting pronouncement regarding fair value measurement found under asc topic formerly sfas  which not only defines fair value but also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard was adopted on january  for financial assets and liabilities and had no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb permitted a one year deferral in applying the fair value measurement provisions found under asc topic to non financial assets and non financial liabilities non financial items that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
therefore  if the change in fair value of a non financial item is not required to be recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on an annual basis or more frequently  the effective date of application of this standard was deferred until fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard as of january  had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement regarding business combinations formerly sfas r 
the purpose of this accounting pronouncement  found under fasb asc topic  is to improve the information provided in financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
the pronouncement requires acquisition date fair value measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquiree 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
the company adopted this standard as of january  and applied it prospectively to business combinations that occurred after adoption 
during march  we acquired the stock of bodet aero bodet and its affiliate atlas productions atlas 
for more detailed information  refer to note  business acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this standard had no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition although the new standard has materially changed the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand 
these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk on certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent the underlying transactions hedged are completed  these forward contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
these forward contracts do not qualify as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment 
any unrealized gains and losses on our contracts are recognized as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents as of december   we had thirty four forward contracts with a contract value of million to sell currencies as follows in thousands currency number contract amount us dollar gbp  us dollars euro us dollar  euros us dollar euro  us dollars this compares to two forward contracts as of december  with a contract amount of million 
the fair value asset of the derivative forward contracts as of december  was approximately million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
the fair value of the derivative forward contracts as of december  was approximately zero 
we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our foreign currency forward contracts fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  found under asc topic the credit valuation adjustments  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties are level inputs 
however  we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our foreign currency forward contracts and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy
