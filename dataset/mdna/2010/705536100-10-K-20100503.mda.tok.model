item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an unaudited estimate of our gain from the investment 
as of january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million comprised of million in cash and million in marketable securities 
our cash balance consists of amounts received in the kmc transaction  revenues received from our operations and dividends received upon our investment in highbury 
as of january   our marketable securities consisted of common stock of highbury and certain hedging instruments with respect to common stock of amg 
as of april   we owned less than  of marketable securities 
we continue to identify and evaluate a number of investment candidates and other alternatives for maximizing value to stockholders 
we have also been working with a consultant to assist the board in identifying investment opportunities 
in the interim  we are managing our cash reserves to preserve our capital in the current economic environment 
see strategic transactions and interim investment strategy under strategy for our company below 
services provided following the kmc transaction  our primary business is licensing software based imaging and networking systems for the digital document product marketplace 
licensing revenues were and of total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
engineering services and maintenance revenues were and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
our historical business has consisted of i products based upon our agreement with novell to license and support nest office sdk  and ii products based upon an agreement with adobe systems corporation adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into new products for oems 
our agreement with adobe expired on march  subsequent to march   we are no longer able to license new devices with respect to our adobe line of business 
we will continue to collect licensing fees for the commercial life of all adobe related products existing as of march  for the useful life of these products under our current sublicensing agreements with customers 
however  all maintenance revenue generated from these products will likely end on or before july  we continue to be party to a license agreement with novell 
we expect to continue to collect licensing fees for the useful life of the novell related technology 
customers we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from direct sales to digital document software product oems 
two of our customers  konica minolta and novell  each generated more than of our total revenues for fiscal year revenues from our top four customers accounted for and of our total revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
we have a sublicense agreement with novell which has generated substantial revenues for us 
our license agreement with adobe  which expired on march   previously generated substantial revenues for us through its expiration 
this agreement will only continue to generate revenue through the commercial life of existing licensed devices 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our company and our historical business we expect a decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the expiration of our agreement with adobe below 
we anticipate that our future revenues may be similarly concentrated with a limited number of customers 
with the consummation of the kmc transaction  most of our prior revenue generating agreements with kmc were terminated 
kmc may continue from time to time to sublicense third party technology from us 
our largest customers greater than of our total revenues vary to some extent from year to year as product cycles end  contractual relationships expire and new products emerge 
our largest customers accounted for million and million of our revenues for fiscal year and  respectively 
our licensing arrangements with our customers are based on the number of products including our technology shipped by these customers and the life cycles of these products 
because we generate a large percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers and a few products  any loss of these customers or products would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our company and our historical business the future demand for our products will decline 
market segments and geographic areas we sell our products and services to oems which produce products for the enterprise and office sector of the digital document product market 
this market is characterized by digital document products ranging in price from approximately to  each at the low end  to more than  at the high end 
these products typically offer high performance  differentiated by customized features 
as a result of these unique requirements  we have typically addressed the office sector of the digital document product market via direct oem relationships with individual digital document product manufacturers 
our major customers in the office market in fiscal year included konica minolta  oki data  panasonic  xerox international partners  and seiko epson 
since the majority of our oem customers are primarily companies headquartered in japan  revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for and of our total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
these customers have sold products containing our technology primarily in the north american  japanese  and european marketplaces 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included herein  for revenues by geographical region for the last three fiscal years 
all of our contracts with international customers are denominated in us dollars  and we expect this to continue 
as a result  we do not incur material foreign currency transaction costs in our business 
industry overview the document imaging industry has rapidly changed 
historically  most electronic imaging products in the office environment were stand alone  monochrome machines  which were dedicated to a single print  copy  fax or scan function 
today s imaging products combine printer  fax and  scan functions in a single color mfp or all in one aio devices 
these changes in technology and end user requirements have created new opportunities and challenges for digital document product manufacturers 
these challenges include customer expectations for higher performance products at lower prices as well as the desire and ability of product manufacturers to develop more and more technology in house 
technology digital imaging products 
peerless offers software based embedded imaging components to oems of printers and mfps 
these imaging components increase the performance  image quality and network connectivity while lowering the overall device cost 
our offerings to our customers have included the following products  most of which we sold to kmc and licensed back from kmc in the kmc transaction peerlessprint family of sdks is a fully compatible peerless implementation of hp pcl page description languages 
the majority of peerlessprint sales are made in conjunction with other peerless technology or third party technology 
peerless xps is a complete embedded rendering solution for applications that use microsoft s xps page description language 
peerlesstrapping is an imaging technology designed to improve print quality of color images 
peerless software print server is a complete software based print server with all networking protocols that enables secure and reliable network print and scan connectivity 
peerlessnet web services sdk provides advanced device control and microsoft windows vista support 
peerlessnet security provides advanced network security functions for digital imaging devices 
before the kmc transaction  our technologies generated a significant number of sales as standalone solutions 
in fiscal  we were party to license agreements with two developers which enabled us to offer complementary technologies developed by adobe and novell to our customers in bundled or single sales 
from to march  we sublicensed adobe postscript  which allowed us to expand and integrate the proprietary technologies we originally developed 
our agreement with adobe expired on march  strategy for our company the strategy for our historical business  which has been in place since  is to address declining demand for our core imaging technologies from our traditional oem customer base 
the strategy has called for the reduction of expenses to better match anticipated revenue and maximizing the value of core technologies 
reduction of expenses 
we will continue to manage our business in a manner that aligns our operating expenses with our ongoing revenue streams 
core technologies 
although our license agreement with adobe has expired  we will continue to license our products with peerless developed intellectual property and our novell related products to current oem and offer such products for sale to new customers 
we will continue to market intellectual property which we own or to which we have licensing rights 
strategic transactions 
we are exploring opportunities to deploy our cash reserves into businesses where we believe we have a strategic advantage 
as part of this strategy  we invested in the common stock of highbury 
we also continue to identify investment opportunities that offer prospects for growth and profitability at a reasonable price 
we are continuing to identify and evaluate a number of acquisition candidates on an ongoing basis 
our focus is not limited to the digital imaging environment  nor is there a focus on the technology segments of the market 
we may target candidates located in the u 
s  with an enterprise value of to million  with a minimum of million of ebitda  in industries other than real estate development and oil and gas exploration and development  with managers who are talented  hard working and trustworthy and whose interests align with our stockholders  in industries that enjoy high barriers to entry and have limited supplier power and or strong franchise value with customers  because we believe these companies will have higher profit margins than their peers  and that have proven business models  are profitable and have demonstrated growth potential 
the foregoing criteria are general guidelines that the board has established in seeking a strategic transaction  which are revised by the board from time to time 
the board may determine to pursue any transaction that it determines is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders  whether or not it meets such guidelines 
we will value companies based upon assets or a multiple of operating income or ebitda  and not a multiple of revenue 
we have a consultant to assist the board in identifying and carrying out investment opportunities 
interim investment strategy 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal of our investments and to maintain a liquid level of investments to meet short term capital requirements for potential investment opportunities  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  from time to time  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  and may also invest in fixed rate debt instruments of federal  state and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
we are exposed to a variety of risks in investments  mainly a lowering of interest rates 
however  we believe an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of  among other things  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as the early implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of the kmc transaction  we sold substantially all of our intellectual property  including all of our patents  to kmc and licensed this ip back from kmc on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis  subject to certain restrictions 
in the kmc transaction  we retained certain of our customized intellectual property that had been previously integrated into products we licensed to third parties or specifically created for our customers other than kmc after december  as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into written nondisclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  prospective customers  oems and strategic partners and take further affirmative steps to limit access to and distribution of our software  intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts and in the event such agreements are not timely made  complied with or enforced  we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
see item a 
risk factors 
risk related to our company and our historical business if we fail to adequately protect intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for damages 
competition the market for outsourced imaging systems for digital document products is highly competitive and characterized by continuous pressure to enhance performance  add functionality  reduce costs and accelerate the release of new products 
we compete on the basis of the set of core technologies we sublicense from third parties  technology expertise  product functionality  and price 
our technology primarily competes with solutions developed internally by oems 
virtually all of our oem customers have significant investments in their existing solutions and have the substantial resources necessary to enhance existing products and to develop future products 
these oems have or may develop competing imaging system technologies and may implement these systems into their products  thereby replacing our technologies  and limiting future opportunities for us 
in fact  oems have increasingly been shifting away from third party solutions in favor of in house development 
therefore  we are required to persuade these oems that our solutions favorably compete with their internally developed products 
we have experienced increased difficulty in these efforts 
we will continue to offer products and time to market advantages in a selected fashion while targeting unique opportunities that we believe exceed what the oems are capable of doing by using their own internal resources 
following the kmc transaction  we are limited in the types of projects that we will attempt  however  we believe that opportunities still exist 
our product offerings have become further limited because our license agreement with adobe  pursuant to which we bundled and sublicensed adobe s licensed products into new products for oems  expired on march  we also compete with software and engineering services provided in the digital document product marketplace by other systems suppliers to oems 
in this regard  we compete with  among others  electronics for imaging inc  primax corporation formerly known as destiny technology corporation  global graphics software ltd  sofha gmbh  software imaging and zoran corporation formerly oak technologies 
our networking and security products compete with  among others  silex technology inc  safenet inc  and rsa  a division of emc corporation 
employees as of january   we had a total of five employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced any work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees

item a 
risk factors our short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to the information contained in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section of the exchange act  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
see forward looking statements above 
risks related to our company and our historical business we expect a decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the expiration of our agreement with adobe 
our agreement with adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into new oem products expired on march  we are unlikely to be able to transition our customer base to another provider 
we will only continue to collect licensing fees for the commercial life of all adobe related products existing as of march  for the useful life of these products under our current sublicensing agreements with customers 
we expect a material decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the end of this agreement 
our revenues from licensing products that include adobe technology were approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the future demand for our products will decline 
our licensing arrangements with our customers are based on the number of products including our technology shipped by these customers and the life cycles of these products 
because we generate a large percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers and a few products  any loss of these customers or products would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
there has been a general decline in the rates of growth for the monochrome work group printer and mfp market segments in which we are engaged 
for those product platforms that do utilize the software we license  the competition has increased and we have experienced significant downward price pressure 
as a result of this  oem demand for our solutions has declined 
this decline occurred in some cases because the oems perceived that our solutions did not meet their technical requirements 
in other cases it occurred because the oems either developed the technology themselves or utilized lower cost offshore software competitors 
although we continue to license our current technology and products to certain oems  there can be no assurance that the oems will continue to need or utilize the products and technology we currently offer 
we had an agreement with adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into new oem products which expired on march  this termination has substantially reduced the range of products we are able to offer 
we believe this will materially decrease future demand for our products 
we may be subject to further government regulation  including the investment company act of  which could adversely affect our operations 
although we are not engaged in the business of investing  reinvesting  or trading in securities  and peerless does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities  peerless may be deemed to be an inadvertent investment company under section a c of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  if the value of its investment securities as defined in the investment company act is found to be more than of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash and certain cash equivalents 
peerless does not intend to be regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
however  if peerless were deemed an investment company requiring registration under the investment company act  applicable restrictions could make it impractical for peerless to continue its business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the event that peerless were to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  peerless would be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the act  including limitations on our ability to borrow  limitations on our capital structure  limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities  restrictions on acquisitions of interests in partner companies  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  prohibitions on the issuance of options and other limitations on our ability to compensate key employees  certain governance requirements  restrictions on specific investments  and reporting  record keeping  voting and proxy disclosure requirements 
if we are deemed an investment company subject to registration under the investment company act  compliance costs and burdens upon peerless may increase and the additional requirements may constrain peerless s ability to conduct its business  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the failure of any financial institution in which we deposit funds could significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available for our corporate and business purposes 
we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents in various accounts with nationally recognized financial institutions 
although we have diversified our holdings in multiple institutions  our accounts may be uninsured and therefore subject to loss or total forfeiture 
financial institutions are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which have been exacerbated by the current financial and credit crisis and bankruptcies which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues 
if any of the financial institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fails or freezes redemptions of our accounts  we may lose part or all of our investments 
the loss of part or all of our investments could significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available for our corporate and business purposes  which would materially and adversely affect our operations 
the industry for imaging systems for digital document products involves intense competition and rapid technological changes  and our business will likely be materially harmed when our competitors develop superior technology 
we anticipate increasing competition for our color products  particularly as new competitors develop and sell competing products 
some of our existing competitors  many of our potential competitors  and virtually all of our oem customers have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than we have 
furthermore  we are not investing in technology to update our products 
other competitors are likely to develop new products which replace the products we currently offer 
if price competition increases  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the amount of royalties received on new licenses 
new technology developed by our competitors and reduced royalties will result in further losses and decrease in our market share 
our licensing revenue is subject to significant fluctuations which may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our recurring licensing revenue model has shifted from per unit royalties paid upon oem shipment of our product and guaranteed quarterly minimum royalties to a model that results in revenues associated with the sale of block and perpetual licenses 
the reliance on block licenses has occurred due to aging oem products in the marketplace  oem demands in negotiating licensing agreements  reductions in the number of oem products shipping and a product mix that changed from object code licensing arrangements to sdks 
revenues may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as the number of opportunities varies  if the signing of block licenses are delayed or the licensing opportunities are lost to competitors 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
failure to maintain our nasdaq listing would adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock 
if we are not able to maintain compliance with nasdaq s listing requirements  our common stock may be subject to removal from listing on the nasdaq capital market 
trading in our common stock after a delisting  if any  would likely be conducted in the over the counter markets in the so called pink sheets or the over the counter bulletin board and could also be subject to additional restrictions 
as a consequence of a delisting  our stockholders would find it more difficult to dispose  or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value  of our common stock 
in addition  a delisting would make our common stock substantially less attractive as collateral for margin and purpose loans  for investment by financial institutions under their internal policies or state legal investment laws or as consideration in future capital raising transactions 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or financial reporting practices  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective or any assurance that the controls  accounting processes  procedures and underlying assumptions will not be subject to revision 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls and financial reporting practices  including collusion  management override  and failure of human judgment 
because of this  control procedures and financial reporting practices are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
in the future we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires increased control over financial reporting requirements  including annual management assessments of the effectiveness of such internal controls and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our system of controls and audits results in a change of practices or new information or conclusions about our financial reporting  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and any adverse change in our relationships with those customers will materially harm our business 
a limited number of oem customers continue to provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
presently  there are only a small number of oem customers in the digital document product market to which we can market our technology and services 
therefore  our ability to offset a significant decrease in the revenues from a particular customer or to replace a lost customer is severely limited 
during fiscal year  two customers  konica minolta and novell  each generated greater than of our revenues  and collectively contributed of revenues for the year 
block licenses for the same time period were of the company s revenue 
along with our oem customers and third party technology suppliers  we face increasingly intense competition within our industry  which is applying significant downward pricing pressure on products and services 
as a result  our oem customers and third party technology suppliers continue to seek lower cost alternatives 
some of our oem customers and third party technology suppliers  including adobe  have developed extensive offshore operations in countries such as india that are capable of delivering lower cost solutions 
the ability of our oem customers and third party technology suppliers to provide similar offerings at a lower cost may result in them no longer needing our services  as well as being in direct competition with us by providing similar technologies at a lower cost to our other customers 
this may result in us losing some of our customers and may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future cash flows 
see financial statements note risks and uncertainties 
if we fail to adequately protect intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for damages 
we protect our proprietary rights in a number of ways  including  but not limited to  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  early implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of the kmc transaction  we sold substantially all of our intellectual property  including all of our patents to kmc and executed a license agreement pursuant to which kmc licensed the intellectual property ip back to us on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis subject to certain restrictions 
excluded from the ip that was sold to kmc was all of our customized intellectual property that had been previously integrated into products or services licensed or otherwise provided by us to third parties or specifically created for customers of ours after december  other than kmc and  which  in either case  had not also been provided to or integrated into products or services licensed to kmc  or developed pursuant to or in connection with certain agreements with kmc 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into written nondisclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  prospective customers  oems and strategic partners and take further affirmative steps to limit access to and distribution of our software  intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts and in the event such agreements are not timely made  complied with or enforced  we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
in any event  enforcement of our proprietary rights may be very expensive 
our source code also is protected as a trade secret 
however  from time to time  we license our source code to oems pursuant to protective agreements  which subjects us to the risk of unauthorized use or misappropriation despite the contractual terms restricting disclosure  distribution  copying and use 
in addition  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to obtain  distribute  copy or use our proprietary information  or to reverse engineer our trade secrets 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products using our technologies increasingly may become the subject of infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of us  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
we may lack sufficient resources to initiate a meritorious claim 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any litigation regarding intellectual property  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or obtain licenses to infringing or substituted technology 
our failure to develop or license on acceptable terms a substitute technology  if required  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are not in compliance with our license agreements  we may lose our rights to sublicense technology  our competitors are aggressively pursuing the sale of licensed third party technology 
we currently sublicense third party technologies to our oem customers  which sublicenses accounted for million and million in revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
such sublicense agreements are non exclusive 
if we are determined not to be in compliance with the agreements between us and our licensors  we may forfeit our right to sublicense these technologies 
likewise  if such sublicense agreements expire  we would lose our right to sublicense the affected technologies 
additionally  the licensing of these technologies has become very competitive  with competitors possessing substantially greater financial and technical resources and market penetration than us 
as competitors are pursuing aggressive strategies to obtain similar rights as held by us to sublicense these third party technologies  there is no assurance that we can remain competitive in the marketplace if one or more competitors are successful in this strategy 
our international activities may expose us to risks associated with international business 
we are substantially dependent on our international business activities 
risks inherent in these international business activities include changes in the economic condition of foreign countries  the imposition of government controls  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  and major currency rate fluctuations  which may affect demand for our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to adapt to international conditions  our business may be adversely affected 
we rely on the services of our executive officers  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our management 
management may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could harm our business 
failure to retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
risk related to our acquisition strategy our current corporate strategy depends in part on our ability to successfully invest in and or acquire the assets or businesses of other companies 
our failure to complete transactions that accomplish these objectives could reduce our earnings and reduce our cash reserves 
in addition  our investments may be subject to substantial risk 
we anticipate investing in and or acquiring the assets or businesses of other companies as part of our current growth strategy 
potential risks involved in such transactions include lack of necessary capital  the inability to satisfy closing conditions  failure to identify suitable business entities for acquisition  the inability to successfully integrate such businesses into our operations  and the inability to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth would require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
in addition  even if we do invest in or acquire other companies  there is no guarantee that such transactions will be successful in producing revenue or profits 
we are pursuing an acquisition strategy which may not enhance value for stockholders 
since the completion of the kmc transaction in april  we have been seeking to redeploy our cash to enhance stockholder value and are seeking  analyzing and evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
we are using a value focused investment strategy 
however  we may not be able to identify any acquisition candidate at a price we consider fair and appropriate 
if we do identify a suitable acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully and satisfactorily negotiate the terms of the acquisition 
furthermore  if we are successful in completing an acquisition  the integration of the acquired business will involve a number of risks and presents financial  managerial and operational challenges 
therefore  we cannot assure that our acquisition strategy will enhance value to stockholders 
a significant portion of our working capital could be expended in pursuing business combinations that are not consummated 
we expect that the investigation of each specific acquisition target and the negotiation  drafting and execution of relevant agreements  disclosure documents  and other instruments will require substantial time and attention and substantial costs including  but not limited to costs  for accountants  attorneys and other advisors 
in addition  we may determine to make down payments or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating business combinations 
if we decide not to further pursue a specific business combination  the costs incurred  which may include down payments or exclusivity or similar fees  will not be recoverable 
furthermore  even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition target  we may fail to consummate the transaction for any number of reasons  including those beyond our control 
any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred  which could materially and adversely affect our subsequent attempts to locate and combine with another business

highlights during fiscal year  we have experienced the following significant changes we experienced a million reduction of rental expense as a result of the early termination of our building leases at the end of fiscal year we also significantly reduced staffing costs by reducing staffing to five employees as of the end of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal  we amended a third party license agreement that resulted in a million change in estimate that resulted from our negotiation and resulting reduction in certain third party licensing cost

over the term of its investment  peerless received aggregate dividends of million on its highbury common stock 
on december   highbury entered into a merger agreement to be acquired by a subsidiary of amg 
following the announcement of the transaction between highbury and amg  we implemented a hedging strategy related to amg common stock 
the purpose of our hedging strategy was to preserve our profits in our shares of highbury if the price of amg common stock fell before the closing of the transaction 
on april   the transaction was completed and our  shares of highbury common stock were converted into  shares of amg common stock or shares of amg common stock per highbury share 
we estimate a gain of approximately million on our investment in highbury  taking into account our purchase price for the highbury securities  dividends received on the highbury common stock  the outcome of our hedging strategy  and incentive compensation to a director and a consultant to the company for their efforts related to the investment 
the foregoing calculation is an estimate as of the date hereof which is subject to change 
such estimate has not been audited by the company s independent registered public accounting firm and does not take into account taxes payable on the capital gains and dividends 
as of april   we owned less than  of marketable securities 
our inability to implement our strategic plan to acquire a new business or be acquired  as well as the declining sales trend of our existing licenses  downward price pressure on our existing technologies  uncertainty surrounding third party license revenue sharing agreements  downward price pressure on oem products and the anticipated consolidation of the number of oems in the marketplace  may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for our software revenues in accordance with provisions of accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements formerly known as statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with asc and  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period 
if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment 
for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by asc if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  unless the only undelivered element is a service in which revenue from the delivered element is recognized over the service period 
product licensing cost we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
our recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
stock based compensation on february  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb asc  compensation stock compensation formerly known as fas r share based payments using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
we use our actual stock trading history as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
upon adoption of asc  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the multiple option ie accelerated approach to the single option ie straight line method 
compensation expense for share based awards granted through january  will continue to be subject to the accelerated multiple option method  while compensation expense for share based awards granted on or after february  will be recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
we recognize these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of four years 
we recorded  in share based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended january  share based compensation expense was allocated as follows for the twelve month period ended january   in sales and marketing and  included in general and administrative expense 
we granted  options and issued  shares of common stock and  shares of restricted common stock in the twelve months ended january  income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years resulting from differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax provision is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in february  the company adopted fasb asc  income taxes formerly known as fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
asc clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained  then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on this consideration  we determined that it is more likely than not that million of certain deferred tax assets were realized in fiscal year as of january   we had tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million which begin to expire fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income
