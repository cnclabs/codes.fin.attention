item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  significant judgments  and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb pertaining to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return for defective products that we account for as a warranty provision under authoritative guidance of accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and related authoritative guidance 
standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
revenue generated from development contracts are recorded on a cost plus basis in the period services are rendered 
certain customer transactions include payment terms whereby we receive a partial payment of the total order amount prior to the related sale being recognized in our financial statements 
these advance payments are included in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet 
generally  these progress payments relate to orders for custom equipment that require a lengthy build cycle and  in some cases  acceptance by the customer 
we may negotiate payment terms with these customers on these particular orders and secure certain payments prior to or on shipment of the equipment 
these payments remain in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue until our applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from our customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage  over a reasonable period of time  is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products  and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements  and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments negatively or positively affecting earnings may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been primarily classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
we also have certain securities that are classified as available for sale and trading 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions  and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with authoritative guidance pertaining to share based payment using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred and specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
a one percent change in actual costs would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
authoritative guidance issued by the fasb pertaining to accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  management determined that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future and an adjustment to record a full valuation allowance was charged to income tax expense  which remains at june  should management determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes to the valuation allowance  changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the fasb pertaining to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses  and a current expectation that  it is more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge on goodwill assets 
during the year ended june   we believe that there has been no other indicator of impairment 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment  intangible assets  and marketable securities 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
a one percent change in actual claims would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview zygo corporation is a worldwide supplier of optical metrology instruments  precision optics  and electro optical design and manufacturing services  serving customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and industrial markets 
optical instruments products encompass non contact optical measurement instruments 
optics products consist of high performance macro optics components  optical coatings  and optical system assemblies 
we conduct the majority of our manufacturing in our  square foot facility in middlefield  connecticut and a  square foot leased facility in tucson  arizona 
in january  dr 
chris l 
koliopoulos was appointed president and chief executive officer and also became a member of the board of directors of zygo 
on january   we completed the acquisition of zemetrics  inc zemetrics  a small interferometric metrology company in which dr 
koliopoulos was a major shareholder  for  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price for zemetrics was valued at million 
the acquisition of zemetrics  which has recently introduced an advanced product in the optical instrumentation market  further strengthens our offering in our core markets  which is a strategic focus for us 
zemetrics is included in the metrology segment 
the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets 
intangible assets included goodwill  technology  and customer relationships 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million relating to acquired goodwill in the period ended march  subsequent to the acquisition date 
over the last five fiscal quarters  we have divested ourselves of our semiconductor and flat panel display fpd product lines and shut down our ic packaging operations in singapore in order to concentrate on our core technologies 
we continue to sell original equipment manufacturer oem sensor heads related to semiconductor and fpd systems manufactured through our instruments product line 
these changes in our organization reduced our research  development and engineering rd e spending in fiscal our rd e expenses included in continuing operations for the twelve months ended june  decreased million as compared with the prior year period 
to a lesser extent  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased with these changes 
the average sales price for the oem sensors is significantly less than the average sales price of an in line semiconductor or fpd system 
therefore  our total revenues related to these markets will be less than if we remained in the in line market 
our backlog at june  was million  an increase of million from june  gross orders were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal net orders for the fourth quarter from the company s metrology segment accounted for of the orders received  with the optics segment accounting for the remaining 
for fiscal  orders were million  an increase of over fiscal as a result of increased activity across all product lines 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology solutions optical systems total revenues for fiscal decreased as compared with the prior year period  reflecting decreases in the metrology solutions segment revenues of  partially offset by the optical systems segment revenue increase of 
the decrease in metrology solutions segment revenues was primarily due to volume decreases in display solutions of million  instruments of million  and lithography of million  partially offset by increased revenues in vision systems of million 
new business in the metrology solutions segment related to oem heads increased revenues by million 
the decrease in display solution revenues was due to the arrangement entered into with toho technology corporation toho in october future revenue related to display will be derived from the sale of sensor heads that will be included in the metrology solutions segment related to oem revenues 
these oem revenues are expected to be lower than the full display system revenues 
the volume decreases in instruments and lithography revenues  in large measure  were due to a reduction in bookings that appears to be tied directly to the general global economic downturn  most notably in the semiconductor industry 
a decrease in bookings from canon accounted for the majority of the decrease in lithography revenues 
the increase in the optical systems segment revenues was primarily due to increases in optical component revenues of million 
approximately of all fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars  as compared with in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the revenues of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross margin year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology solutions optical systems total gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal was  which represents an increase of thirteen percentage points from the comparable prior year period which included charges for severance  inventory adjustments and impairment charges totaling million 
excluding these charges  the gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the prior year period would have been 
within the metrology solutions segment  gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues to for the twelve months ended june  as compared with the prior year comparable period of 
the comparable prior year period included million of the charges referred to above 
excluding those charges the fiscal metrology gross margin would have been 
the increase to gross margin in the current year period in the metrology segment was primarily due to improved factory costs and a decrease in low margin display revenues 
within the optical systems segment  the gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues to for the twelve months ended june  as compared with in the comparable prior year period 
the optical systems segment gross margin for the twelve months ended june  was negatively impacted by production issues experienced in the first quarter of fiscal related to certain optics  resulting in negative gross margins 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal decreased million 
sg a in fiscal and included significant charges of million and million  respectively 
excluding these charges  total sg a costs would have been million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease to million from million is primarily related to costs eliminated with the sale of our semiconductor and display product lines  as well as employee headcount and salary reductions 
the large significant charges for fiscal included million in costs related to the ii vi unsolicited offer  million in ceo search and retirement costs  million of zemetrics acquisition expenses  and million in severance expense partially offset by million reversal in a provision for bad debt reserve 
the large significant charges for fiscal included million in terminated merger related expenses  million in bad debt reserves  million in legal accruals  million in intangible asset impairment charges related to the vision systems business and million in severance 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales rd e costs decreased million in fiscal as compared with the prior year period 
fiscal included charges related to severance costs of million 
fiscal included charges related to intangible asset and fixed asset impairment charges of million and severance costs of million 
excluding these charges  rd e for fiscal and would have been million and million  respectively 
the decrease in rd e was primarily due to the elimination of costs related to the semiconductor and display product lines in june and october  respectively 
impairment of goodwill year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended march  relating to acquired goodwill in connection with its acquisition of zemetrics 
the zemetrics reporting unit had minimal sales history and cumulative losses since inception 
in addition  the fair value of common stock issued as consideration on the closing date was per share  which was in excess of the implied value per share in the formula used in the purchase agreement to determine the number of common shares issued as consideration which was based on the market price per share during the day period prior to closing 
in consideration of these factors  management determined the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  and that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero at march  other income year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales other income for fiscal decreased by million  as compared with the prior year period  primarily due to a decrease in investment income 
we changed our investment portfolio and have a low risk government security portfolio  which carries a significantly lower interest rate than corporate bonds  and a greater percentage of cash is invested money market accounts 
income tax benefit expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate income tax expense in fiscal included an increase in the valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance increased in to recognize changes in deferred assets for the fiscal year 
these changes in gross deferred assets would otherwise have increased tax expense 
fiscal does not include any tax benefit associated with the net operating loss for the fiscal years or tax credits earned in the fiscal year 
management continues to believe that  based upon the uncertain and volatile market conditions and the fact that zygo remains in a cumulative pre tax accounting loss position over a three year period  it is not more likely than not that the current net deferred tax assets will be realized 
in future periods  the valuation allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during fiscal  the company was able to realize an income tax benefit for refund claims associated with net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits due to changes in the united states tax regulations 
in addition  we realized a benefit from the reversal of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as such positions were settled in fiscal these income tax benefits were partially offset by income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and state income taxes in the united states 
the income tax benefits are not anticipated to occur again in the future 
net earnings loss from continuing operations attributable to zygo corporation year ended dollars in millions june  sales june  sales net loss from continuing operations attributable to zygo corporation in fiscal was million compared with a net loss from continuing operations attributable to zygo corporation of million in the prior year

the net loss in fiscal included million in significant charges  net of taxes  which included asset impairment charges  write downs and reserves on various other balance sheet items  and a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
these charges were incurred primarily as a result of the economic downturn and recent changes in our business strategy and operations resulting in re evaluation of certain of our assets

transactions with stockholder sales to canon  a stockholder  customer  and distributor of certain of our products in japan  amounted to million of net revenues  million of net revenues  and million of net revenues for the years ended june    and respectively 
selling prices of products sold to canon are based  generally  on the normal terms customarily given to distributors 
at june  and  there was in the aggregate million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology solutions optical systems total net revenues in the metrology solutions segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net revenues of million within the metrology solutions segment was primarily due to revenue volume decreases in lithography of million  instrument revenues of million  and semiconductor revenues of million  partially offset by an increase in display revenues of million 
the general economic recession has led to low revenue volume 
net revenues in the optical systems segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net revenues of million within the optical systems segment was due to a decrease in volume of contract manufacturing of million and laser and precision optics of million 
the decrease in all optics areas generally is related to a decline in the orders from existing customers due primarily to the economic recession 
approximately of all fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars  similar to the percentage of revenues we experienced in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the revenues of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross margin year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology solutions optical systems total in fiscal  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in the metrology solutions segment decreased fourteen percentage points as compared with the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to intangible and fixed asset impairments of million and inventory reserves of million 
excluding these charges  our gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the metrology solutions segment would have been 
the decrease from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding million of referenced charges is due to lower revenue volume 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues in the optical systems segment decreased by fourteen percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this decrease included charges of million for fixed asset impairments  restructuring  and severance  which account for five percentage points of the change year over year 
the remainder of the change is primarily related to underutilization of the factory based on low revenue volume 
optics components rely upon a capital intensive production facility and certain expenditures  such as depreciation  cannot be reduced as readily as a labor intensive environment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased million primarily due to increases in general and administration costs of million  partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing activities of million

excluding these charges  rd e for fiscal would have decreased to million 
the decrease in rd e from million in fiscal to million excluding million in referenced charges in fiscal is primarily due to decreases in our stage metrology million and semiconductor million rd e spending 
stage metrology spending was reduced in response to the lack of customer demand related to the slowdown in the semiconductor market and the general economic recession 
semiconductor rd e spending decreased as several large rd e projects related to new product development were completed or are nearing completion 
fiscal spending on these projects was less than in fiscal income tax expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate income tax expense in fiscal included an increase in the valuation allowance of million against all net deferred tax assets 
fiscal also does not include any tax benefit associated with the net operating loss for the fiscal year or tax credits earned in the fiscal year 
management believes  based upon the uncertain and volatile market conditions and the fact that zygo is now in a cumulative pre tax accounting loss position over a three year period  it is no longer more likely than not that the current net deferred tax assets will be realized 
in future periods  the valuation allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized

orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the metrology solutions segment and million  or  in the optical systems segment 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal compared with fiscal we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  customer credit requirements  investments in businesses  and the adequacy of available bank lines of credit 
at june   cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities were million  an increase of million from million at june  our marketable security consists of million in a united states treasury bill as security for bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these letters of credit are used primarily overseas to cover certain warranty periods and are valued at of the associated contract value 
as of june   million in standby letters of credit are outstanding and are expected to expire at varying dates through july the cash equivalents balance in our money market account  which is invested primarily in us government securities  is million as of june  we do not believe there is any risk to liquidity in the money market account  nor are there currently any limits on redemptions 
at june  we had million of gross accounts receivable related to our display customers which were overdue 
of this amount  million has been reserved based on a customer by customer analysis of the likelihood of recovery 
we have not experienced significant delays in payments from non display customers 
we currently have no debt or outstanding lines of credit at june  and in the future  if the need for debt or credit lines arose there is no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing due to the lack of credit availability in the financial markets or our own financial position 
we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility and cash reserves to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months

payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation and non compete agreements consulting agreement total at june   we do not have any liability for uncertain tax benefits in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt  or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated in our financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including institutional money market funds which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
we have only million invested in a marketable security and million in a low risk money market accounts 
there is little downward exposure on our interest income 
to the extent interest rates increase or we change our investment strategy  we could see an increase in investment income 
the table below presents investment amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in dollars in millions thereafter marketable securities fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate on june   the company had variable interest rate money market accounts valued at million 
marketable securities fair market value sensitivity we have reviewed  along with our investment advisor  current investment ratings  company specific events  and general economic conditions in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included orders in us dollars of million  or of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the japanese yen 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
