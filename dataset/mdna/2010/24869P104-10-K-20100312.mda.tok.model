item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview at december   the denny s brand consisted of  restaurants   of which were franchised licensed restaurants and of which were company owned and operated 
prior to the implementation of our franchise growth initiative in  the denny s brand consisted of  restaurants   of which were franchised licensed restaurants and of which were company owned and operated 
revenues our revenues are derived primarily from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company owned restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the denny s name 
during  we continued our franchise growth initiative fgi  a strategic initiative to increase franchise restaurant development through the sale of certain geographic clusters of company restaurants to both current and new franchisees 
in  as a result of our fgi  we sold restaurant operations and certain related real estate to franchisees for net proceeds of million 
as of december   the total number of company restaurants sold since our fgi program began in early is the sale of company restaurants to franchisees has a significant impact on company restaurant sales and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees 
specifically  revenues are impacted as follows company restaurant sales have decreased significantly as a result of the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
in general  we have sold restaurants with below average sales volumes  which in turn should raise the average sales volume and average operating margin of our remaining company restaurant portfolio 
the decline in company restaurant revenues is partially offset by increased royalty income derived from the growing franchise restaurant base 
this royalty income is included as a component of franchise and license revenue 
the resulting net reduction in total revenue related to our fgi is generally recovered by a decrease in depreciation and amortization from the sale of restaurant related assets to franchisees and a reduction in interest expense resulting from the use of our fgi proceeds to reduce debt 
additionally  initial franchise fees  included as a component of franchise and license revenue  are generally recorded in the period in which a restaurant is sold to a franchisee 
these initial fees are completely dependent on the number of restaurants sold during a particular period 
certain franchisees purchasing company restaurants under our fgi have also signed development agreements to build additional new franchise restaurants 
in addition to franchise development agreements signed under our fgi  we have negotiated development agreements outside of our fgi program under our market growth incentive plan mgip 
the positive impact of these development programs is evident in the new franchise restaurant openings in as a result of our fgi and mgip programs  we expect that the majority of new denny s restaurants will be developed by our franchisees 
development of company owned restaurants will focus on core markets  strategic locations and nontraditional opportunities 
as a result of continued franchisee demand for denny s restaurants and our desire to expand our base of franchise locations  we expect to continue to sell company restaurants to franchisees during our targeted portfolio mix is appropriately franchised and company operated 
we anticipate achieving this goal through a combination of new franchise unit growth and the sale of restaurants to franchisees over the next couple of years 
however  the current economic environment and availability of credit to franchisees will impact the number of restaurants we are able to sell to franchisees and the number of restaurants our franchisees are able to develop 
sales and customer traffic at both company operated and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns  new product introductions and customer service  as well as external factors including competition  economic conditions affecting consumer spending  and changes in guest tastes and preferences 
as with many other restaurant companies  the economy has had a significant impact on sales during and cost of company restaurant sales our costs of company restaurant sales are exposed to volatility in two main areas product costs and payroll and benefit costs 
many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility 
this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable 
in general  we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors 
during and  our ability to lock in prices on several key commodities added to our favorable product costs in an environment in which many commodity prices were on the rise 
in addition  our continued success with menu management helped to further reduce product costs 
our promotional activities focused on menu items with lower food costs that still provided a compelling value to our customers  such as our build your own grand slam promotion 
increased incident rates of menu items such as our signature grand slam breakfast  everyday value slam and weekday slam contributed to favorable product costs as a percentage of sales 
the volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs 
a number of our employees are paid the minimum wage 
accordingly  substantial increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
additionally  declines in guest counts and investments in store level labor can cause payroll and benefit costs to increase as a percentage of sales 
during  payroll and benefit costs especially benefited from the favorable development of workers compensation claims 
this benefit is the result of multiple years of increased focus on safety at the unit level in addition to the benefit derived from selling company owned restaurants to franchisees 
many of our costs vary based on sales and unit count 
certain costs such as occupancy and other operating expenses have fixed components that may not react as directly to changes in sales and unit count 
however  as noted above  many of our below average sales volume units have been sold through our fgi 
as a result  cost of company restaurant sales as a percentage of sales have generally improved during costs of franchise and license revenue our costs of franchise and license revenue include occupancy costs related to restaurants leased or subleased to franchisees and direct costs consisting primarily of payroll and benefit costs of franchise operations personnel 
these costs are significantly affected by our fgi 
as units are sold to franchisees  denny s generally leases or subleases the land and building to the franchisee 
as a result  the occupancy costs related to these restaurants moves from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy income from franchisee lease payments 
debt and interest interest expense has a significant impact on our net income as a result of our indebtedness 
however  during and  we continued to reduce interest expense through a series of debt repayments using the proceeds generated from our fgi transactions  sales of real estate and cash flow from operations 
these repayments resulted in an overall debt reduction of approximately million during and million in we continue to take a conservative approach to our cash management 
while we paid down approximately million in debt during  we chose to maintain more than million in cash at year end given the uncertain outlook for the economy and the capital markets 
we will continue to balance our debt reduction goals and our commitment to maintain an ample liquidity cushion 
we are subject to the effects of interest rate volatility since approximately million  or  of our debt has variable interest rates 
to minimize the interest rate volatility we participated in an interest rate swap on the first million of floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap  which was scheduled to end on march   was terminated on december  statements of operations fiscal year ended december  december  december  dollars in thousands revenue company restaurant sales a franchise and license revenue b total operating revenue costs of company restaurant sales c product costs payroll and benefits occupancy other operating expenses total costs of company restaurant sales costs of franchise and license revenue c general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating gains  losses and other charges  net total operating costs and expenses operating income other expenses interest expense  net other nonoperating income expense  net total other expenses  net net income before income taxes provision for income taxes d net income d other data company owned average unit sales franchise average unit sales company owned equivalent units e franchise equivalent units e same store sales increase decrease company owned f g guest check average increase g guest count decrease g same store sales increase decrease franchised and licensed units f g a we estimate that the additional  or rd  week added approximately million of company restaurant sales in b we estimate that the additional  or rd  week added approximately million of franchise and license revenue in  consisting of million of royalties and million of occupancy revenue

company restaurant sales decreased million  or  primarily resulting from an equivalent unit decrease in company owned restaurants and the rd week in the decrease in equivalent units primarily resulted from the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees as part of our fgi program 
total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased to from 
product costs decreased to from due to price increases taken to help offset commodity inflation 
payroll and benefits costs decreased to from primarily as a result of million in favorable workers compensation claims development over the prior year 
payroll and benefit costs also benefited from improved scheduling of restaurant staff  partially offset by higher incentive compensation 
occupancy costs increased to from as a result of changes in the portfolio of company owned restaurants and the decrease in same store sales 
other operating expenses were comprised of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales fiscal year ended december  december  dollars in thousands utilities repairs and maintenance marketing legal settlement costs other direct costs other operating expenses utilities decreased by percentage points primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity costs 
marketing increased by percentage points primarily as a result of the establishment of local advertising cooperatives during and the overall decrease in other operating expenses primarily results from the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees

this increase was partially offset by the decrease from the rd week in and the effects of a decrease in same store sales 
the increase in equivalent units resulted from the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees 
during we opened franchise restaurants and sold restaurants to franchisees as compared to the opening of franchise restaurants and the sale of restaurants to franchisees during although we opened more franchise units during  initial fees remained essentially flat as a result of incentives included in certain franchise development agreements 
the increase in occupancy revenue of million  or  is primarily the result of the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees  offset by the decrease from the rd week in costs of franchise and license revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in occupancy costs of million  or  is primarily the result of the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees 
other direct costs increased by million  or  due primarily to million of franchise related costs associated with our super bowl promotion and million increase in field management labor and incentive compensation 
occupancy costs as a percentage of occupancy revenue are generally higher than other direct costs as a percentage of royalties and fees 
therefore  as occupancy revenue increases as a percentage of total franchise and license revenue  the cost of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue will increase 
as a result  costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and franchise operations 
general and administrative expenses were comprised of the following fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands share based compensation general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses the increase in share based compensation expense is primarily due to the adjustment of the liability classified restricted stock units to fair value as of december  the million decrease in other general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of decreased staffing attributable to organizational structure changes implemented during the second quarter of this decrease is partially offset by a million increase in expense related to our deferred compensation plan resulting from gains on the underlying assets of the plan and a million increase in incentive compensation

the million of severance and other restructuring charges for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the departure of our chief operating officer and chief marketing officer during the fourth quarter 
the million of severance and other restructuring charges for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a reorganization to support our ongoing transition to a franchise focused business model 
the reorganization led to the elimination of approximately positions in impairment charges for the years ended december  and december  related to underperforming restaurants  as well as restaurants and real estate held for sale

the provision for income taxes was million compared with million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the reduction in our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and december  results primarily from the recognition of million and million of current tax benefits in and related to the enactment of certain federal laws during the first quarter of and the third quarter of  respectively 
we have provided valuation allowances related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to our net operating losses nol generated in previous periods 
in addition  during  we utilized certain state nol carryforwards and deductions from expired federal wage based income tax credits whose valuation allowances were established in connection with fresh start reporting on january  accordingly  for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of federal and state deferred tax expense with a corresponding reduction to the goodwill that was recorded in connection with fresh start reporting 
the adoption of the accounting standards codification s guidance on business combinations during the first quarter of requires that any additional reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in connection with fresh start reporting be recorded as a component of income tax expense rather than as a reduction to the goodwill established in connection with the fresh start reporting

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility as defined in note and  in recent years  cash proceeds from the sale of surplus properties and sales of restaurant operations to franchisees  to the extent allowed by our credit facility 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt repayments 
the following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the increase in operating cash flows primarily resulted from a decrease in the runoff of working capital deficit during following the sale of a large number of restaurant operations to franchisees during the fourth quarter of we believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for  combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility  will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
net cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended december  these cash flows primarily represent net proceeds of million on sales of restaurant operations to franchisees and sales of other real estate assets 
the proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of million  of which million was financed through capital leases 
our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the maintenance of our existing company owned restaurants and facilities  new construction  remodeling and our strategic initiatives  as follows fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands facilities new construction remodeling strategic initiatives other total capital expenditures we generally expect our capital requirements to trend downward as we reduce our company owned restaurant portfolio and remain selective in our new restaurant investments 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   which included million of term loan prepayments and million of scheduled term loan payments made through a combination of asset sale proceeds  as noted above  and cash generated from operations 
our credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility including up to million for a revolving letter of credit facility  a million term loan and an additional million letter of credit facility reduced from million during the fourth quarter of 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million under our letter of credit facility 
there were no outstanding letters of credit under our revolving facility and no revolving loans outstanding at december  these balances result in availability of million under our letter of credit facility and million under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility matures on december  the term loan and the million letter of credit facility mature on march  the term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate equal to approximately per annum with all remaining amounts due on the maturity date 
the revolving facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances such as required payments related to asset sales typical for this type of credit facility and may make certain optional prepayments under the credit facility 
the credit facility is guaranteed by denny s and its subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of denny s and its subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by first priority mortgages on company owned real estate assets 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants ie  maximum total debt to ebitda as defined under the credit facility ratio requirements  maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio requirements  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and limitations on capital expenditures  negative covenants  conditions precedent  material adverse change provisions  events of default and other terms  conditions and provisions customarily found in credit agreements for facilities and transactions of this type 
we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility as of december  as of december   interest on loans under the revolving facility is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points and will adjust over time based on our leverage ratio 
interest on the term loan and letter of credit facility is payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate under the term loan was 
our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consisted of the following payments due by period total less than year years years years and thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations interest obligations a pension and other defined contribution plan obligations b purchase obligations c total a interest obligations represent payments related to our long term debt outstanding at december  for long term debt with variable rates  we have used the rate applicable at december  to project interest over the periods presented in the table above 
the capital lease obligation amounts above are inclusive of interest 
b pension and other defined contribution plan obligations are estimates based on facts and circumstances at december  amounts cannot currently be estimated for more than one year 
c purchase obligations include amounts payable under purchase contracts for food and non food products 
in most cases  these agreements do not obligate us to purchase any specific volumes and include provisions that would allow us to cancel such agreements with appropriate notice 
amounts included in the table above represent our estimate of purchase obligations during the periods presented if we were to cancel these contracts with appropriate notice 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including potential interest and penalties 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
at december   our working capital deficit was million compared with million at december  the decrease in working capital deficit resulted primarily from the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees during and we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to self insurance liabilities  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring and exit costs  income taxes and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities 
we record liabilities for insurance claims during periods in which we have been insured under large deductible programs or have been self insured for our medical and dental claims and workers compensation  general product and automobile insurance liabilities 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from million to million per individual claim for workers compensation and for general product and automobile liability 
the liabilities for prior and current estimated incurred losses are discounted to their present value based on expected loss payment patterns determined by independent actuaries using our actual historical payments 
these estimates include assumptions regarding claims frequency and severity as well as changes in our business environment  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact our overall self insurance costs 
total discounted workers compensation and general liability insurance liabilities at december  and december  were million reflecting a discount rate and million reflecting a discount rate  respectively 
the related undiscounted amounts at such dates were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the restaurant level on a quarterly basis  when assets are identified as held for sale or whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of restaurant level assets based on the operating cash flows of the restaurant  expected proceeds from the sale of assets and our plans for restaurant closings 
generally  all units with negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months at each quarter end are included in our assessment 
in performing our assessment  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from similar asset sales  and other factors to determine both the recoverability and the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant are not recoverable based upon estimated future  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  for underperforming restaurants  including restaurants closed and company owned restaurants classified as held for sale 
these charges are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had a total of three restaurants with an aggregate net book value of less than million  after taking into consideration impairment charges recorded  which had negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months 
restructuring and exit costs 
as a result of changes in our organizational structure and in our portfolio of restaurants  we have recorded charges for restructuring and exit costs 
these costs consist primarily of the costs of future obligations related to closed units and severance and other restructuring charges for terminated employees 
these costs are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
discounted liabilities for future lease costs and the fair value of related subleases of closed units are recorded when the units are closed 
all other costs related to closed units are expensed as incurred 
in assessing the discounted liabilities for future costs of obligations related to closed units  we make assumptions regarding amounts of future subleases 
if these assumptions or their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
exit costs recorded for each of the periods presented include the effect of such changes in estimates 
the most significant estimate included in our accrued exit costs liabilities relates to the timing and amount of estimated subleases 
at december   our total discounted liability for closed units was approximately million  net of million related to existing sublease agreements and million related to properties for which we expect to enter into sublease agreements in the future 
if any of the estimates noted above or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
income taxes 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets do not include future tax benefits that we deem likely not to be realized 
share based compensation 
stock based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the fair value of restricted stock units containing a market condition is determined using the monte carlo valuation method  which utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see the new accounting standards section of note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for further details of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread of basis points per annum for the term loan and letter of credit facility and basis points per annum for the revolving credit facility 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap economically hedged our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on the first million of floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap  through march   we paid a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and received payments from the counterparties based on the month libor rate for a term ending on march   effectively resulting in a fixed rate of on the million notional amount 
on march   we terminated million of the notional amount of the interest rate swap 
on december   we terminated the remaining million of the notional amount of the interest rate swap 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by basis points our annual cash flow and income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the variable rate portion of the credit facility at december  however  the nature and amount of our borrowings under the credit facility may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our other outstanding long term debt bears fixed rates of interest 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate long term debt excluding capital lease obligations and revolving credit facility advances was approximately million compared with a book value of million at december  this computation is based on market quotations for the same or similar debt issues or the estimated borrowing rates available to us 
specifically  the difference between the estimated fair value of long term debt compared with its historical cost reported in our consolidated balance sheets at december  relates primarily to market quotations for our denny s holdings  inc senior notes due we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our pension plan  other defined benefit plans and self insurance liabilities 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan by approximately million and would impact the pension plan s net periodic benefit cost by million 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our other defined benefit plans by less than million while the plans net periodic benefit cost would remain flat 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate related to our self insurance liabilities would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products  such as beef  poultry  pork  eggs and coffee  and utilities such as gas and electricity  which are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable 
changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors generally and often simultaneously 
in general  we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors 
although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  the majority of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing fixed pricing and or price ceilings and floors 
we use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  competitive circumstances could limit such actions and  in those circumstances  increases in commodity prices could lower our margins 
because of the often short term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases  we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant 
we have established a policy to identify  control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes
