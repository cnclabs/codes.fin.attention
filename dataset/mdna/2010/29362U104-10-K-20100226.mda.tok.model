item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations along with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the factors and uncertainties that may affect future results section of this item the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview this overview is not a complete discussion of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the detailed discussion and analysis that follows and must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the company s financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and related industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers as well as thin film transistor liquid crystal display tft lcd and hard disk manufacturers  which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia  europe and the middle east 
the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that it believes provide the most comprehensive offering of contamination control solutions and microenvironment products and services to the microelectronics industry 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth  while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable products includes membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters  resin based gas purifiers  wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch  ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing 
the company s capital expense driven products include our components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies  to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes  and our process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a significant portion of the company s product costs except for raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short to medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to effects of industry cyclicality  technological change and substantial competition  including pricing pressures and foreign currency effects 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially resin and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 

table of contents fixed cost structure increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  facility costs  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  the company s financial results for the year ended december  were significantly affected by the difficult global economic conditions and  more specifically  the severe downturn in both the capital and unit driven segments of the semiconductor industry that began during the second half of the year ended december  on a sequential basis  revenues declined sharply from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of an upturn in bookings and sales of the company s products began in the second quarter of  with sales improving to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of net sales for were million  down  from net sales of million reported for the sales decline was mitigated by the full year inclusion of sales of poco graphite  inc poco  which was acquired in august excluding that factor  sales fell in when compared to in the company s view  the business and industry downturn reached a trough during the first quarter of during the second quarter  the company began to experience a modest upturn in bookings and sales of certain of its unit driven  consumable products  while recovery of the company s capital driven product lines began in the third quarter 
the company believes the revenue downturn was primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion has been nominal 
mainly reflecting the significant year over year sales decrease and associated lower factory utilization  the company reported considerably lower gross profits and a reduced gross margin 
the company s gross margin in was versus in the company had lower year over year selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering  research and development er d costs for when compared to  mainly reflecting lower salary  incentive and benefits costs resulting from headcount reductions  temporary pay reductions and furloughs 
the company incurred restructuring charges of million in  mainly in connection with business restructuring activities related to the transfer of a portion of our chaska  minnesota production to malaysia and other existing facilities  and actions taken in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
as a result of aforementioned factors  the company reported a loss from continuing operations of million for compared to a loss of million in the loss was substantially attributable to goodwill impairment charges of million million  net of tax as discussed in below section titled impairment of goodwill 
because of the difficult business environment described above  the company projected early in that it would violate the debt covenants in its then existing revolving credit facility 
accordingly  the company s management  working with its banks  undertook the amendment of its revolving credit facility 
in march  the company amended and restated its revolving credit facility 
the restated revolving credit facility was further amended in july and august and as of december  supported million in borrowings 
the company s ability to borrow under the restated credit facility is also subject to a borrowing base  which is calculated based on the company s level of qualifying us accounts receivable  inventories and value of property  plant and equipment 

table of contents the restated revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain compliance with new debt covenants and to pay higher rates of interest 
through december   the company was in compliance with all applicable debt covenants 
the company s restated credit agreement contains financial covenants that limit its ability to make capital expenditures in excess of million in both and plus certain unused amounts from the prior period million for  requires that the company maintain a minimum level of cash in the united states  and requires the company to achieve certain levels of ebitda performance during the first quarter of beginning in the second quarter of  the company must maintain or exceed fixed charge coverage and cash flow leverage ratios 
also see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company issued common stock in a registered public offering  receiving net proceeds of million 
as required by the terms of the company s restated credit agreement  the proceeds were used to reduce the amount outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
during  the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared with million at december  the decrease in cash mainly reflects the million reduction of debt  partially offset by proceeds of the registered public offering 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  business combinations and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  this could result in material differences in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances  historical bad debt write off experience and current economic circumstances when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical and current trends in product returns 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 

table of contents inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities each quarter 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and sales levels by product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full allowance is recorded 
in addition  allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions or the company s planned outlook for improved sales levels  additional inventory write downs or allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of net property  plant and equipment and million of net intangible assets 
the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of the value of its long lived assets  particularly its manufacturing equipment  and its intangible assets  are present 
a long lived asset asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances a 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group b 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator d 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group e 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group f 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group in question is less than its carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its respective fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the asset groups determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the fair value attributable to the asset group is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
in connection with triggering events during the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  the company reviewed its long lived assets and determined that none of its long lived assets were impaired for its asset groups 
the determination was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows for the company s asset groups  which were greater than their carrying values 
as required under us generally accepted accounting principles  the impairment analyses for the third and fourth quarters of occurred before the goodwill impairment assessments 
long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level asset groups for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
the company has 
table of contents four significant asset groups  identified by assessing the company s identifiable cash flows and the interdependence of such cash flows contamination control solutions ccs  micro environments me  poco graphite poco and entegris specialty coatings esc 
the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset groups included only future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset asset group incorporated the company s assumptions about its use of the asset group and were determined for the remaining useful life of the primary asset the principal long lived tangible asset being depreciated or intangible asset being amortized that is the most significant component asset from which the asset group derives its cash flow generating capacity of each asset group 
the key assumptions were projected revenues  gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates 
future cash flows used to test the recoverability of each asset group were made for the remaining useful life of the asset group  which itself is based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset of each group as described below 
where the primary asset is not the asset of the asset group with the longest remaining useful life  estimates of future cash flows for the group assume the sale of the group at the end of the remaining useful life of the primary asset 
the recoverability test included all cash outflows that the asset group is estimated to incur to obtain the estimated future cash inflows 
accordingly  where required  the company reflected within the cash flows of its asset groups an allocation of corporate expenses to its asset groups  because those assets require the services provided by the company s shared services infrastructure among others  finance  human resources  information technology  sales and marketing  legal if the asset group were operated on a stand alone basis 
under the first quarter impairment test  all asset groups had future undiscounted cash flows in excess of their carrying values by at least  except for the me asset group  which the company estimated had future undiscounted cash flows higher than its carrying value 
the carrying values of this asset group s property  plant and equipment and intangible assets at march  were million and million  respectively 
if either revenue for the company s asset groups decreased from the then current forecast without offsetting decreases in costs  or if the asset group s operating costs increased from the then current forecast without offsetting increases in revenue  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset groups could have been less than their carrying values 
this would have required an impairment loss to be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the respective asset group over its fair value 
as noted  fair value would be determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
actual results of the me asset group for the nine month period ended december  were better than forecasted at the end of the first quarter 
as described above  the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the primary asset of the group and long range forecasts of revenue and costs  reflecting management s assessment of general economic and industry conditions  operating income  depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  particularly in the current economic environment and forecast of a recovery  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
based on improved economic conditions within the semiconductor industry and the absence of any other triggering events  the company was not required to perform impairment testing for any of its asset groups for the second  third and fourth quarters of due to the uncertain economic environment within the semiconductor industry  the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events to determine whether additional asset 
table of contents impairment testing is warranted 
it is possible that in the future the company may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of its long lived assets  nor can the company provide assurance that material impairment charges of long lived assets will not occur in future periods 
impairment of goodwill the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company s annual impairment test is performed as of august factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  resulting in the company s market capitalization being below its net book value 
in  the company tested for impairment its goodwill in connection with its annual impairment test of goodwill as of august   and due to events and changes in circumstances through the end of  the company had additional triggering events that indicated impairments had occurred 
based on the results of the company s assessment of goodwill for impairment  it was determined that the carrying value of the company s net assets exceeded its estimated fair value 
accordingly  the company performed a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of its goodwill 
the company performed the assessment of impairment of its goodwill twice during the year  once during the third quarter  when the company wrote off million of goodwill  and the second time at the end of the year  when the company wrote off its remaining goodwill of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no goodwill recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
management considers the positive and negative evidence for the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets 
when management concludes that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets in the future  it records a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
as a result of the recent general economic and industry declines  and their impact on the company s future outlook  management has reviewed its us deferred tax assets and concluded that the uncertainties related to the realization of its deferred tax assets have become unfavorable 
the company had us net deferred tax asset positions of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which comprised temporary differences and various credit carryforwards 
management has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize the net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to us deferred tax assets 

table of contents the negative evidence of a cumulative three year us operating loss  the expectation for us operating results in early future years and a finite carryforward period for the company s us foreign tax credits was sufficiently significant to outweigh all identified positive evidence and tax planning strategies 
the company had net non us deferred tax asset positions before valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
at those dates  management determined that based upon the available evidence  a valuation allowance was required against non us deferred tax assets in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to certain non us deferred tax assets 
for other non us jurisdictions  principally japan  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as management expects sufficient future earnings in those jurisdictions 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
estimated claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at december  and  the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  the company normally utilizes the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact net income 
share based compensation u 
s generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company must estimate the value of employee stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 

table of contents forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience and current expectations 
if the above factors change  and the company uses different assumptions in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
certain restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards involve stock to be issued upon the achievement of performance conditions performance shares under the company s stock incentive plans 
such performance shares become available subject to time based vesting conditions if  and to the extent that  financial performance criteria for the applicable fiscal year or multi year period are achieved 
accordingly  the number of performance shares earned will vary based on the level of achievement of financial performance objectives for the applicable period 
until such time that the company s performance can ultimately be determined  each quarter the company estimates the number of performance shares more likely than not to be earned based on an evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods when the underlying factors change the company s evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
accordingly  share based compensation expense associated with performance shares may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollars in thousands of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill restructuring charges operating loss interest expense  net other expense  net loss before income taxes and equity in net loss of affiliates income tax benefit expense equity in net loss of affiliates loss from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december   net sales were million  down million  or  from sales for the year ended december  the company s sales decline primarily reflected the continuation of the difficult global economic conditions and  more specifically  the severe downturn in both the capital and unit driven segments of the 
table of contents semiconductor industry that began during the second half of on a sequential basis  revenues declined sharply from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of an upturn in bookings and sales of the company s products began in the second quarter of  with sales improving to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of in the company s view  the business and industry downturn reached a trough during the first quarter of during the second quarter  the company began to experience a modest upturn in bookings and sales of certain of its unit driven  consumable products  while recovery of the company s capital driven product lines began in the third quarter 
the company believes the revenue downturn was primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion has been nominal 
the sales decline was mitigated by the full year inclusion of sales of poco graphite  inc poco  which was acquired in august excluding that factor  sales fell in when compared to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency rates was negligible 
the sales decline included an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of million related to the year over year weakening of most international currencies  most notably the korean won  taiwanese dollar and the euro  versus the us dollar  which were essentially offset by the relative strength of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in decreased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for the year over year shift in relative demand toward unit driven products reflects lower spending by semiconductor customers for capital driven  capacity related products such as wafer carriers and liquid systems 
sales of unit driven products fell in excluding sales of poco products  sales of unit driven products fell in unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  and wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
sales of shippers declined  sales of data storage products fell by and sales of filters fell by year over year sales of capital driven products decreased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of control systems declined by due to lower sales of valves and flow controllers  which fell by 
sales of wafer transport products such as mm and mm foups fell by 
sales of gas microcontamination products also fell by primarily due to decreased sales of gas filtration products 
gross profit gross profit for decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for 
table of contents the significant year over year sales decrease accounted for approximately of the gross profit decline for the company experienced lower factory utilization due to the sales decrease  particularly during the first half of the year 
this resulted in manufacturing production falling below normal capacity 
accordingly  the company included in cost of sales period expense of million in the year ended december  in connection with its below capacity production levels  accounting for of the decrease in the company s gross margin rate 
in addition  the company s gross profit in was also affected by unfavorable product mix  with a greater portion of sales related to lower margin products  as well as increased overhead rates associated with reduced production levels 
in  the company recorded a million incremental charge to cost of sales associated with the amortization of the fair market value mark up of inventory acquired in business combinations as compared to million in similar charges in the inventory mark ups were recorded in connection with the poco and pureline co  ltd 
pureline business combinations and were charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory 
the net reduction in charges associated with the amortization of the fair market value mark ups had a favorable impact on the company s overall gross margin percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for decreased million  or  compared to million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from a year earlier  reflecting the decrease in net sales 
the year over year decrease in sg a costs includes compensation related reductions of million  reduced travel expense of million and professional services expense of million  and a favorable foreign currency translation effect of million 
sg a expenses for the year ended included million of severance related costs due to personnel terminations associated with operational streamlining efforts 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the reduction in er d expense mainly reflects lower employee costs 
er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million for impairment of goodwill the company performed the assessment of impairment of its goodwill twice during  once in connection with its annual impairment test of goodwill and due to events and changes in circumstances through the end of the fourth quarter of the company had a second trigger event that indicated impairments had occurred 
in addition  the company tested for impairment of its long lived assets 
the factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted impairment triggering events included a significant decrease in the company s market capitalization throughout  to a level significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets  and a significant decline in management s forecasted level of business 
as a result of the impairment assessments  the company recorded impairment charges of goodwill of million in as of december  and  the company had no remaining goodwill 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in compared to million in the year ago period 
in  the company initiated a global business restructuring of its sales and marketing function  manufacturing operations  and realignment of the global supply chain and other ancillary operational functions 
the company has incurred employee termination and other costs in connection with the business restructuring and actions taken in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry that began during the second half of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

table of contents interest expense income  net net interest expense was million in compared to net interest expense of million in the variance was due mainly to a significant increase in the company s average outstanding debt compared to a year ago and higher interest rates under the company s restated credit agreement 
other expense income other expense was million in compared to million in in  other expense consisted mainly of foreign currency transaction losses of million primarily related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities held by the company s us entity and an impairment loss on an equity investment of million in the fourth quarter of other expense in includes impairment losses on equity investments of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million  also primarily related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities 
income tax expense the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate was in compared with a rate in in  the company s tax rate was lower than us statutory rates  mainly due to the million increase in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets associated with us operating losses  and thus provided an allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
the company also reduced its foreign valuation allowance by million 
the effective tax rate for is principally attributable to two factors 
the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in most of the company s goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for income tax purposes 
accordingly  the company recognized a tax benefit of only million in connection with the impairment charge 
also during  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryovers  general business carryovers and foreign tax credit carryforwards  million of which related to discontinued operations 
the company carried no valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  as a result of the general economic and industry downturn  and its impact on the company s future outlook  management reviewed its deferred tax assets and concluded that the uncertainties related to the realization of its assets  became unfavorable 
management considered that the negative evidence of a cumulative three year us operating loss  the expectation for us operating results in early future years and a finite carryforward period for the company s us foreign tax credits was sufficiently significant to outweigh all identified positive evidence and tax planning strategies 
accordingly  management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the company would realize certain deferred tax assets and thus provided an allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded would not be utilized 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded a net loss of million in the company completed the sale of its cleaning equipment business  classified as a discontinued operation  for proceeds of million in april net loss the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the company s loss from continuing operations for was million  or per share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the net loss for included a goodwill impairment charge of million million  net of tax 

table of contents segment analysis effective january   the company changed its financial reporting structure reflecting organizational changes 
beginning in  the company will report its financial performance based on three reporting segments 
the following is a discussion on the results of operations of these three business segments

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest bearing cash equivalents  long term debt and short term borrowings are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
most of the company s long term debt at december  carries floating rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents are instruments with maturities of three months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately million annually 

table of contents the cash flows and earnings of the company s foreign based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign based operations 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward contracts 
on february   the company entered into a month japanese yen based cross currency interest rate swap  with aggregate notional principal amounts of billion japanese yen and million that matured on november  this swap effectively hedged a portion of the company s net investment in its japanese subsidiary 
during the term of this transaction  the company remitted to  and received from  its counterparty interest payments based on rates that were reset quarterly equal to three month japanese libor and three month us libor rates  respectively 
the company designated this hedging instrument as a hedge of a portion of the net investment in its japanese subsidiary  and used the spot rate method of accounting to value changes of the hedging instrument attributable to currency rate fluctuations 
accordingly  a million adjustment in the fair market value of the hedging instrument related to changes in the spot rate was recorded as a charge to foreign currency translation within accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity in to offset changes in a portion of the yen denominated net investment in the company s japanese subsidiary and will remain there until the net investment is disposed 
the company recorded million in net interest income in in connection with the cross currency interest rate swap 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of its materials  including polymers and stainless steel  was modestly higher in compared to entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase slightly in labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits were lower in due to the company s actions to align spending with lower sales volumes amidst the semiconductor industry s downturn 
slightly higher total labor costs can be reasonably anticipated for as the company reinstates some the temporary cost reductions put in place in the first half of the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with its large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
