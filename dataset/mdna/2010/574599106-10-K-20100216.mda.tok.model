item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial  also may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following  which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

table of contents a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels  both of which have experienced a significant downturn 
a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity levels  principally in north america and europe 
the new home construction market  which is cyclical in nature  has undergone a significant downturn marked by declines in the demand for new homes  an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for homebuyers 
the oversupply of existing homes held for sale has been exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures  which has contributed to the downward pressure on home prices 
unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction  this economic decline has also adversely affected our home improvement businesses 
low levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home prices have made it much more difficult for homeowners to make additional investments in their homes  such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects 
further  disruptions in the credit markets have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements 
we believe that  during the third and fourth quarters of  there have been some signs of stabilization in our markets and we continue to believe that the long term outlook for the home improvement and new home construction markets is favorable 
however  we cannot predict the type  timing or strength of a recovery in our markets 
depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvements and new home construction have adversely affected our results of operations and our financial position 
furthermore  the economic turmoil has caused certain shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and has resulted in changes in the business models and strategies of our customers 
such shifts  which may or may not be long term  have altered the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers 
if we do not timely and effectively respond to these changing consumer preferences  our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected  the demand for our products could be reduced and our market share could be negatively affected 
a prolonged economic downturn could reduce our financial resources and flexibility 
the valuation of assets on our balance sheet  particularly goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses 
a further decline in the expectation of our future performance or a continuation of the adverse conditions in the new home construction markets may cause us to recognize non cash impairment charges  which are not determinable at this time  for certain long lived assets  including goodwill  and could result in a reduction in our shareholders equity in the future 
such a reduction in our shareholders equity may limit our borrowing capacity under our existing five year revolving credit agreement 
we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 
the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business 
larger customers can make significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services  our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business 
sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial 
in  sales to our largest customer  the home depot  were billion approximately percent of our consolidated net sales 
lowe s is our second largest customer 
in  our sales to lowe s were less than percent of our consolidated net sales 
although homebuilders  dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services  the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe s would have a material adverse effect on our business 
as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers  conflicts between our existing distribution channels have occurred  and will continue to occur 
in addition  we may undermine the 
table of contents business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our larger customers 
in addition  our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity  which may affect the products we can offer to other customers 
our principal markets are highly competitive 
the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and  in recent years  competition has intensified significantly 
competition is further intensified during economic downturns 
home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers  particularly low cost suppliers in asia  for sale as private label and house brand merchandise 
also  home center retailers  which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers  are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers 
we believe that competition in our industries is based largely on price  product and service quality  brand reputation  customer service and product features and innovation 
although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories  price is often a primary factor 
in addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the economic downturn in our markets  our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers  implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets  capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names  managing our cost structure  accommodating shorter life cycles for our products and product development and innovation 
the cost and availability of materials and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 
it has been  and likely will continue to be  difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other materials that are major components of our products or services 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices 
delays in adjusting  or in our inability to adjust  selling prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements with customers  competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases 
further  when commodity prices decline  we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services 
changes in energy costs and certain commodities not only impact our production costs  but also the cost to transport our products 
we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia 
the distances involved in these arrangements  together with differences in business practices  shipping and delivery requirements  the limited number of suppliers  and laws and regulations  have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain  the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 
we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components 
if there is an interruption in these sources of supply  we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 
international political  monetary  economic and social developments affect our business 
over percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds 
in addition  we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia 
our international business faces risks associated with changes in political  monetary  economic and social environments  labor conditions and practices  the laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 
us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad  including tax laws and laws regulating various 
table of contents business practices  also impact our international business 
our international operating results may be influenced  when compared to our north american results  in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products 
the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 
we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets  including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 
we have maintained investments in available for sale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds  although we are reducing such investments 
since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in addition  we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 
the decline in economic conditions in resulted in the decline in the value of our investments in debt and equity securities  including assets held in our pension plans 
at december   the fair value of such investments and assets remains at reduced levels 
claims and litigation could be costly 
we are  from time to time  involved in various claims  litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us 
these matters may include contract disputes  personal injury claims  warranty disputes  environmental claims or proceedings  other tort claims  employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation  including class actions 
in recent years  we have experienced class action lawsuits predicated upon claims for antitrust violations  product liability and wage and hour issues 
we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases 
due to their scope and complexity  however  such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged 
we are subject to product safety regulations  recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and  regardless of the ultimate outcome  can be costly to defend 
also  we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell 
as a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers  we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 
increasingly  homebuilders  including our customers  are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business 
our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install 
these claims  often asserted several years after completion of construction  frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors  including us  and require us to incur defense costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 
although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously  given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation  we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter  and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the 
table of contents risks presented 
the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities 
if any significant accident  judgment  claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see note s to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 
government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 
government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge  domestically as well as internationally 
in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date  even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future 
compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing 
such actions could adversely impact our operating results  and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 
the long term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract  develop and retain talented management 
to be successful  we must attract  develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management  sales  marketing and product design and innovation and  as we consider entering new international markets  skilled personnel familiar with these markets 
we compete with multinational firms for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting  developing  motivating and retaining them 
the failure to attract  develop  motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors of this report  the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect our performance 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview we manufacture  distribute and install home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  homebuilders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors

our international businesses face political  monetary  economic and other risks that vary from country to country  as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk 
in addition  litigation could be costly 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

table of contents we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment  such amounts are recorded in receivables 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
in addition  we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on going basis 
during downturns in our markets  declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults 
our bad debt expense was million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
in north america  we manufacture products principally windows  doors and cabinets and provide installation of insulation and other products and services to homebuilders 
our bad debt expense related to homebuilders was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments on january   we adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities 
this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
further  it defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of the fair value for financial instruments  as follows level inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs as observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data  and level inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
we have maintained investments in available for sale securities and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  we record investments in available for sale securities at fair value  and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized  net of tax effect  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
we estimated the fair value of investments in available for sale securities using primarily level inputs 
we estimated the fair value of our investment in asahi tec preferred stock using a discounted cash flow model level input 
if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by basis points  the value of the asahi tec preferred stock would change by approximately three percent 

table of contents in the past  we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every  or days 
at december   our investment in auction rate securities was million  we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model level input 
if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by basis points  the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately million 
we carry our investments in private equity funds at cost 
it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds because there are no quoted market prices  and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund 
these investments are evaluated  on a non recurring basis  for potential other than temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present  or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred  that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
due to the significant unobservable inputs  the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level input 
impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance  asset quality or business prospects  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment  a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates  industry and sector performance  current equity and credit market conditions  and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund  including industry and sector performance 
the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential other than temporary impairment include current economic conditions  market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive and transportation  residential and commercial construction  bio technology  health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds investments operate 
at december   we have investments in venture capital funds  with an aggregate carrying value of million 
the venture capital funds invest in start up or smaller  early stage established businesses  principally in the information technology  bio technology and health care sectors 
at december   we also have investments in buyout funds  with an aggregate carrying value of million 
the buyout funds invest in later stage  established businesses and  other than the heartland industrial partners fund  which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector  no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 
since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
the timing of distributions from the funds  which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
during  we recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges of million related to our investment in five private equity funds 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of each year  or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
we selected the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants 
we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of 
table of contents goodwill at the operating segment level  as defined by accounting guidance 
our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities  for which discrete financial information  including five year forecasts  are available 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
our judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes 
in estimating future cash flows  we rely on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
we generally develop these forecasts based upon  among other things  recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in  for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market including those in the installation and other services segment  we utilized estimated housing starts  from independent industry sources  growing from current levels to million units in terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by terminal growth year 
we generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital discount rate of approximately nine percent to discount the estimated cash flows 
however  in and  due to market conditions  we increased the discount rate for most of our reporting units  based upon a review of the current risks impacting our businesses 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
in  we recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating million million  after tax 
the pre tax impairment charge of million relates to our european shower enclosure manufacturer and reflects a decline in the reporting unit s anticipated long term outlook 
the pre tax impairment charge of million relates to our manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools and reflects a decline in the reporting unit s anticipated long term outlook 
a five percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december  would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment 
a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december  would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the cabinets and related products segment  one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment and one reporting unit in the other specialty products segment 
we review our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  in the fourth quarter  or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
we consider the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each 
table of contents reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
stock based compensation our long term stock incentive plan the plan provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms to employees and non employee directors 
at december   outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of long term stock awards  stock options  phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
long term stock awards we grant long term stock awards to key employees and non employee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market 
we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
there was million nine million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december   which was included as a reduction of common stock and paid in capital 
effective january   we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards  typically to years except for stock awards held by grantees age or older  which vest over five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age for stock awards granted prior to january   we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards  typically years  or for executive grantees that are  or will become  retirement eligible during the vesting period  we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee s retirement 
pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was million for stock options we grant stock options to key employees and non employee directors 
the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than years after the grant date 
we measure compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted subsequent to january   we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age the expense for unvested stock options at january  is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted prior to january   we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years 
pre tax compensation expense for stock options was million for we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor and expected option life years 
for expense calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in was per option share

employee retirement plans accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based upon vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each 
table of contents employee works 
we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 
in march  based on management s recommendation  the board of directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
the freeze was effective january  as a result of this action  the liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze were remeasured and we recognized a curtailment charge of million in the first quarter of in december  we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  citigroup pension discount curve 
the discount rates we use for our defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined benefit pension plans  the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the decision to freeze all future benefit accruals  in accordance with accounting guidance  the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net gain of approximately percent compared to average gains of percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 
our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december   such unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and we expect pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by basis points  the pension expense would increase by million 
we expect pension expense for our non qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in we have several funding options and credits available and we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately million to million in to our qualified defined benefit plans 
income taxes we have considered potential sources of future taxable income in determining the amount of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
of the million of deferred tax assets recorded at december  net of the valuation allowance  million is anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability  and million is anticipated to be realized through future gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain operating assets and through capital gains in the carryback period 
the continued utilization of our tax planning strategies is largely dependent upon the future performance of certain businesses 
a significant decline in the expectation of future performance may impact our valuation allowance assessment 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
the need 
table of contents to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 
effective january   the fasb issued new guidance which allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
this new guidance establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to as unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  we believe that there is a greater potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with prior guidance 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
accordingly  additional provisions for tax related matters  including interest and penalties  could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
other commitments and contingencies certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers 
a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return 
however  certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us 
our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue  and we record deductions at the time of sale 
we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel 
when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 
see note s to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 
corporate development strategy our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units  including consolidations  and increasing synergies among our business units 
going forward  we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow  organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development  start up businesses related to home energy services and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses 
as part of our strategic planning  we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long term growth strategy 
during  we sold two european business units in the plumbing products segment that were not core to our long term growth strategy 
we recognized a net pre tax loss of million in related to these transactions 
we accounted for the business units which were sold in  and  as discontinued operations 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents during  we acquired a small business in the plumbing products segment  this business allows us to expand into a developing market and had annual sales of million  for a net purchase price of million in cash 
during  we acquired a relatively small countertop business cabinet and related products segment 
this business  which allows us to expand products and services we offer to our customers  had annual sales of over million 
during  we acquired several relatively small installation service businesses installation and other services segment  as well as erickson construction company and guy evans  inc installation and other services segment 
the results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by a combination of our operations  long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets  and by the issuance of our common stock  including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 
maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies  such strategies have led to cash of over billion at december  our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
at our request  in late april  our bank group modified the terms of our five year revolving credit agreement  which expires in february after reviewing our anticipated liquidity position  we requested that the maximum amount we could borrow under this facility be reduced to billion from billion  in addition  the debt to total capitalization ratio requirement has been increased from percent to percent 
the debt to total capitalization ratio and the minimum net worth covenants have also been amended to allow the add back  if incurred  of up to the first million of certain non cash charges  including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact shareholders equity 
we incurred approximately million of fees and expenses associated with the amendment 
if the facility is utilized  we will incur higher borrowing costs as a result of the amendment 
the amended five year revolving credit agreement contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth  at december   our net worth exceeded such requirement by billion 
under the terms of the amended five year revolving credit agreement  any outstanding letters of credit reduce our borrowing capacity 
at december   we had million of unused letters of credit 
the amended five year revolving credit agreement also contains limitations on additional borrowings  related to the debt to total capitalization requirements  at december   we had additional borrowing capacity  subject to availability  of up to billion 
in addition  at december   we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately million  and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 
in order to borrow under the amended five year revolving credit agreement  there must not be any defaults in our covenants in the credit agreement ie  in addition to the two financial covenants  principally limitations on subsidiary debt  negative pledge restrictions  legal compliance requirements and maintenance of insurance and our representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing ie  principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change  in each case since december   no material erisa or environmental non compliance and no material tax deficiency 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  and we had cash and cash investments of over billion at december  principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 
our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts  money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations 
while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk  it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

table of contents we have maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds  principally as part of our tax planning strategies  as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses 
we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid available for sale and marketable securities to balance risk 
since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources  we have and will continue to reduce our investments in long term financial assets 
during  we announced the reduction of our quarterly dividend to

we have a scheduled maturity of our long term indebtedness in march when million of our floating rate notes become due

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near term working capital and other investment needs 
we believe that our longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and  to the extent necessary  from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 
consistent with past practice  we anticipate repurchasing shares in to offset any dilution from long term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 
net cash used for investing activities was million  and included million for capital expenditures and million for acquisitions 
cash provided by investing activities included primarily million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and property and equipment and million from the net sale of financial investments

consolidated results of operations we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
however  we believe that certain non gaap performance measures and ratios  used in managing the business  may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods 
non gaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative for  our reported results
