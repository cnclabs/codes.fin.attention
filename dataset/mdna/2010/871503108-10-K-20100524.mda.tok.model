we invest in various retention marketing and customer loyalty programs to help drive renewals and encourage customer advocacy and referrals 
we also provide focused vertical marketing programs in targeted industries and countries 

table of contents we typically offer two types of rebate programs within most countries volume incentive rebates to channel partners and promotional rebates to distributors and end users 
distributors and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon product sales to end users 
we also offer rebates to individual users who purchase products through various resale channels 
both volume incentive rebates and end user rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue 
research and development symantec embraces a global research and development r d strategy to drive organic innovation across the company 
engineers throughout the company pursue advanced projects and work with our engineering centers  research labs and global services teams to translate r d into next generation technologies and integrate our unique set of technology assets across the portfolio

the team uses this vast intelligence to develop new technologies and approaches  such as symantec s reputation based security technology  to protect customer s information 
research and development expenses  exclusive of in process research and development associated with acquisitions  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of revenue in the respective periods 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

customers in fiscal and  one distributor  ingram micro accounted for of our total net revenue in both periods 
in fiscal  ingram micro did not account for of total net revenue 
our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consist of several non exclusive  independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries  each of which cover different countries or regions 
each of these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement  and these agreements are not based on the same form of contract 
in fiscal and  one reseller  digital river accounted for and of our total net revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  we launched a new  internally developed ecommerce platform which will reduce our reliance on digital river 

table of contents acquisitions our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets 
we consider time to market  synergies with existing products  and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies  product lines  or companies 
we may acquire and or dispose of other technologies  products and companies in the future 
during fiscal  we completed the following acquisitions company name company description date acquired gideon technologies  inc a provider of standards based information security compliance solutions january  softscan a provider of hosted security solutions for e mail and web in the nordic region 
october  for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
competition our markets are consolidating  highly competitive  and subject to rapid changes in technology 
we are focused on integrating across the product portfolio and include next generation technology capabilities into our solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include time to market  price  reputation  financial stability  breadth of product offerings  customer support  brand recognition  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors  we face indirect or potential competition from retailers  application providers  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers  and other oems  who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products 
we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
in addition  we compete with other software companies  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies  products  or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 
the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 
consumer some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive 
our competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition  which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free  engage in aggressive marketing  or enter into competitive partnerships 
our primary competitors in the consumer segment are mcafee  inc mcafee  and trend micro inc 
trend micro 
there are also several smaller regional security companies and freeware providers that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
for our consumer backup offerings  our primary competitors are mozy  inc  owned by emc corporation emc  and carbonite  inc 
security and compliance in the security and management markets  we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our solutions 
our primary competitors in the security and management market are landesk software  inc  mcafee  microsoft corporation microsoft  and trend micro 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
in the saas security market our primary competitors are google inc s postini services and microsoft 

table of contents storage and server management the markets for storage and backup are intensely competitive 
our primary competitors are ca  inc  commvault systems  inc  emc  hewlett packard company hp  ibm corp 
ibm  microsoft  sun microsystems  inc acquired by oracle corporation  and vmware  inc 
services we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability  customer responsiveness  and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel 
our primary competitors in the services segment are emc  hp  ibm  and regional specialized consulting firms 
in the managed security services business  our primary competitors are ibm  and secureworks  inc intellectual property protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software  and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual arrangements  and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products  services  and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  and corporate partners  and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment  and networks 
trademarks  patents  copyrights  and licenses symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries 
in addition to symantec and the symantec logo  we have used  registered  and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices  and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may be challenged 
in addition  we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products  and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license  or other intellectual property right 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters 
a 
table of contents significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met  and because a significant portion of our in period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance 
employees as of april   we employed more than  people worldwide  approximately percent of whom reside in the us approximately  employees work in sales and marketing   in research and development   in support and services  and  in management and administration

item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
adverse global economic events may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios 
during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment  current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products  upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software  or purchase services 
customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite third party financing to complete the purchase of our products and services 
an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us  or delay paying us  for previously purchased products and services 
accordingly  reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
in addition  weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties 
this would further increase our credit risk exposure and  potentially  cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 
in addition  financial institution difficulties may make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations  investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have an even more direct  and harmful  impact on our business 

table of contents fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors  and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  competition  product obsolescence  technological change  shifts in buying patterns  financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers  levels of broadband usage  awareness of security threats to it systems  and other factors 
while such factors may  in some periods  increase product sales  fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales 
if demand for our products declines because of general economic conditions or for other reasons  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance  or if we are unable to continually improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms  operating systems and hardware products  such as netbooks entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies  including integrating our various security and storage technologies  management solutions  customer service  and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions incorporating acquired products and technologies addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new or acquired products developing or expanding efficient sales channels obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products  including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems in addition  if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends  our revenue could be negatively impacted 
in connection with our enterprise software offerings  we license our applications on a variety of bases  such as per server  per processor  or based on performance criteria such as per amount of data processed or stored 
if enterprises continue to migrate towards solutions  such as virtualization  which allow enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they are required to own and operate  we may experience lower license revenues unless we are able to successfully change our enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take into account the impact of these new solutions 
if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new products  product upgrades  and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive environment  and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenue that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete successfully  we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services  effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors  appropriately respond to competitive strategies  and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed  used  and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets 
if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands  we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 
our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings 
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end users of our products  we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps 
our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if they more actively promote our competitors products than our products 
in addition  software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
we face growing competition from network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers 
these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 
security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
some companies offer the lower priced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that are inferior to our products 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective  full featured products such as those that we provide 
the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 
another growing industry trend is the saas business model  where software vendors develop and host their applications for use by customers over the internet 
this allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed  internally operated software without the associated complexity or high initial set up and operational costs 
advances in the saas business model could enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the success of our traditional software licensing models 
we are offering our own saas offerings  including those related to our fiscal acquisition of message labs  and we continue to incorporate these offerings into our licensing model 
however  we may not be able to successfully incorporate our saas offerings into our current licensing models 
our inability to successfully develop and market new and existing saas product offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

table of contents if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers around the world through multi tiered sales and distribution networks 
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks  including the following direct sales 
a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end users 
special risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts difficulty in hiring  retaining  and motivating our direct sales force substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive  including regular updates to cover new and revised products indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may  from time to time  place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing  promotions  and other terms offered by our competitors recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems shipped our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due  among other things  to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain partners sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions  strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales in many cases we must incur up front costs to access the oem channel  particularly in the consumer market  and we may not recoup those up front costs if customers do not ultimately activate and purchase our products 
table of contents if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully  these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 
some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons  these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future  and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect to acquire in the future  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations  workforce  products  and technologies into our existing business  sales force  employee base  product lines  and technology diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to the acquired business the addition of acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses  write off of in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense  such as the billion goodwill write down we recorded during fiscal integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming  and expensive process  and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests  and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 
in june  we sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
as a result of the sale of the notes  we have a substantially greater amount of long term debt than we maintained prior to that sale 
in addition  we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of billion 
as of april   we had no borrowings under our credit facility 
from time to time in the future  we may also incur indebtedness in addition 
table of contents to the amount available under our credit facility 
our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
of our outstanding convertible notes  billion matures and is repayable in june and the balance is due in june we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing 
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or may not be adequately enforced requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation that could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase 
the level of corporate tax from sales to our non us customers is less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers 
this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

table of contents our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and  in some cases  may have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  damage to our brand  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees  lose key personnel  fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  or fail to manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management  technical  sales  marketing  finance  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans  and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer equity based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
from time to time  key personnel leave our company 
while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes  the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 

table of contents from time to time we are a party to class action lawsuits  which often require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses  and which could  if not determined favorably  negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation 
the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including claims regarding patents  copyrights  and trademarks 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and distract management from day to day operations 
if we are not successful in defending such claims  we could be required to stop selling  delay shipments of  or redesign our products  pay monetary amounts as damages  enter into royalty or licensing arrangements  or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain  use  distribute  and sell our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software  operating system  and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor  or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers 
in addition  any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in  alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa  or the software information industry association siia  could be costly  may distract management from day to day operations  and may lead to additional claims against us  which could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  which may include  by way of example  the gnu general public license gpl  gnu lesser general public license lgpl  the mozilla public license  the bsd license  and the apache 
table of contents license 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
by the terms of certain open source licenses  we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
in addition  many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and harm our reputation as a company 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information and or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
the theft and or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position  reputation  brand and future sales of our products  and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information 
our business could be subject to significant disruption  and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm  in the event of such incidents and claims 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights impairment of goodwill stock based compensation expense restructuring charges impairment of long lived assets loss on sale of a business and similar write downs of assets held for sale 
table of contents for example  during fiscal  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion  resulting in a significant net loss for the year 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal  and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management 
our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
our determination of fair value relies on management s assumptions of our future revenues  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  we evaluate our other long lived assets  including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that the value of these assets might be impaired 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  we could incur an impairment charge against the value of these assets 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our effective tax rate may increase  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction in which we are subject to taxes has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority 
we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

table of contents factors associated with our industry  the operation of our business  and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the number  severity  and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers movement in interest rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by  among other things  earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties health or similar issues  such as a pandemic any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business symantec is a global provider of security  storage and systems management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information 
we provide customers worldwide with software and services that protect  manage and control information risks related to security  data protection  storage  compliance  and systems management 
we help our customers manage cost  complexity and compliance by protecting their it infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their it investments 
fiscal calendar we have a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march unless otherwise stated  references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended april   april  and march  fiscal and each consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year will consist of weeks and will end on april  our operating segments our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services  distinguished by customer needs 
since the march quarter  we have operated in five operating segments consumer  security and compliance  storage and server management  services  and other 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our reporting segments to better align to our operating structure  resulting in the enterprise vault products that were formerly included in the security and compliance segment being moved to the storage and server management segment 
also  our saas offerings moved to either the security and compliance segment or the storage and server management segment from the services segment  based on the nature of the service delivered 
as a result  the revenue contribution from our saas offering primarily benefited our security and compliance segment following the move 
we revised the segment information for the prior year to conform to the new presentation 
for further descriptions of our operating segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments 
financial results and trends revenue decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the challenging economic environment resulted in corporate it budgets being reduced and spending has slowed from previous levels 
smaller it budgets have led some of our corporate customers to purchase smaller volumes of our products  particularly in the storage and server management segment 
in addition  our storage business within the storage and server management segment has 
table of contents been adversely affected for the last several quarters by the deceleration of demand in the server market 
additionally  we were also particularly affected by lower new license sales of our storage products on the solaris platform 
if the economic conditions affecting global markets continue or it spending remains tight  we may continue to experience slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating results might suffer 
in light of these economic conditions  we will continue to align our cost structure with our revenue expectations 
during fiscal  we experienced significantly higher year over year oem placement fee payments resulting from an increase in pc unit shipments on which our products were bundled 
these increased payments had an adverse impact on our operating income and operating margins during the fiscal periods  particularly for our consumer segment 
we expect to see the revenue benefit from these increased placement fees in future periods 
we launched a new  internally developed and operated ecommerce platform during fiscal that will replace the current online store for the company s norton branded consumer products worldwide  excluding japan 
we believe this will improve our ability to identify and capitalize on emerging customer needs and market trends and enhance the end to end experience our customers have with us 
we have been transitioning customers to the new online store in a phased approach 
the new online store is gradually ramping up worldwide coverage and is expected to reach full capacity by june  the development and roll out of our new ecommerce platform adversely affected the operating margins for our consumer segment during fiscal the fees we have paid to digital river have historically been recorded as an offset to revenue 
as a result of bringing the ecommerce business in house  our consumer revenue is expected to increase due to the elimination of this offset to revenue 
we expect revenue to increase in the range of to million in fiscal from this change 
conversely  the cost of running our own ecommerce platform will be classified primarily in operating expenses with some amounts flowing through cost of revenue 
therefore  operating expenses and cost of goods sold will both rise by a corresponding amount in and we believe the net impact to earnings per share for will be neutral 
over time  we expect our new ecommerce strategy to increase consumer operating margins 
we expect to capture the differential between what we have traditionally paid digital river and the ongoing cost of operating our own ecommerce platform 
fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately million for fiscal as compared to fiscal foreign currency fluctuations had relatively little overall impact on our international revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if our level of international sales and expenses increase in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 
as discussed above under fiscal calendar  fiscal and consisted of weeks  whereas fiscal consisted of weeks 
the extra week contributed to additional amortization of deferred revenue of approximately million in fiscal our net income was million for fiscal and was positively impacted by a decrease of million in cost of revenue related to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal net income was also positively impacted by a million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the december veritas v 
commissioner us tax court decision relating to the veritas and tax years 
in addition  net income for fiscal was positively impacted by million of net gain from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if 
table of contents actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition  and any applicable amendments or modifications 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 
for arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  packaged products with content updates  managed security services  and subscriptions  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product content updates  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist  such as managed security services and subscriptions 
deferred revenue totaled approximately billion as of april   of which million was classified as long term deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
for arrangements that include both software and non software elements that are within the scope of the newly adopted accounting standards  further described below under recently adopted authoritative guidance  we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non software deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 
for our consumer products that include content updates  we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users  as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the end user 
we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand  which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because 
table of contents we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 
arrangements for managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time  and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance  subscription  or service period 
reserves for product returns 
we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 
reserves for rebates 
we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue 
for consumer products that include content updates  rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if actual redemptions differ from our estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates  and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments 
before performing the goodwill impairment test  we first assess the value of long lived assets in each reporting unit  including tangible and intangible assets 
we then perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value book value of equity 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit  there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test 
this second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business  using the reporting unit s calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
many assets and liabilities  such as accounts receivable and property and equipment  are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit  and therefore  we apply judgment to 
table of contents allocate the assets and liabilities  and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units 
similarly  we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values 
the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years 
to determine a reporting unit s fair value  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach with the market approach  which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 
applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions 
we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs 
this  in turn  involves further estimates  such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation 
this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year 
for example  in our valuation process in the fourth quarter of fiscal we used a lower discount rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated with the global economic conditions 
changes in these key estimates and assumptions  or in other assumptions used in this process  could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 
as of april   our goodwill balance was billion 
based on the impairment analysis performed on january   we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than of the carrying value 
while discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis  we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed 
these factors include a prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in the demand for our products  the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets  a loss of key personnel  our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting units  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in addition  for intangible assets with indefinite lives  we review such assets for impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset group and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we record impairment charges on developed technology or acquired product rights when we determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be recoverable 
to determine the net realizable value of the assets  we use the estimated future gross revenue from each product 
our estimated future gross revenue of each product is based on company forecasts and is subject to change 
long lived assets including assets held for sale 
we assess long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
we record impairment charges on long lived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
in determining our fair value  we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties 
fair value of financial instruments the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we use such pricing data as the primary input  to which we have not made any material adjustments  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio  and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 
the fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to their estimate of fair value 
as of april   our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included billion of assets 
our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds  bank securities  and government securities and represent of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
as of april   billion of investments were classified as level  most of which represents investments in money market funds 
these were classified as level because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets 
determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment 
as of april   million of investments were classified as level  of which million and million representing a combined of level financial instruments represent investments in bank securities and government securities  respectively 
these were classified as level because either the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of similar securities or their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets 
level inputs generally are based on non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data  quoted prices for similar instruments  and or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
while determining the fair value for level instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment  it generally involves the following level of judgment and subjectivity determining whether a market is considered active an assessment of an active market for marketable securities generally takes into consideration whether a trading market exists for a given instrument or trading volume for each instrument type 
our level financial instruments were classified due to either low trading 
table of contents activity in active markets or no active market existing 
for those securities where no active market existed  amortized cost was used and approximates fair value because of their short maturities 
for certain financial instruments classified as level as of april   we used identical securities for determining fair value 
determining which model derived valuations to use in determining fair value when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available  we may price marketable securities using non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data  or pricing models  such as discounted cash flow approaches  with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 
in addition  the credit ratings for issuers of debt instruments in which we are invested could change  which could lead to lower fair values 
as of april   the fair value of million of fixed income securities was determined using benchmark pricing models for identical or similar securities 
as of april   we have no financial instruments with unobservable inputs classified in level under the hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements 
level instruments generally would include unobservable inputs to be used in the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the options  actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation  we only record stock based compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest 
as a result  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures may differ 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required  if any  for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and 
table of contents may revise our estimates 
any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 
income taxes we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal  state  and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  refinement of estimates  or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
in july  we reached an agreement with the irs concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the july acquisition 
the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  and therefore eligible for a effective us federal rate of tax  in lieu of the statutory rate 
the final impact of this agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the us tax court 
to the extent that we owe taxes as a result of the transfer pricing dispute  we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease 
we currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe million or less  for which an accrual has already been made 
we made a payment of million to the irs for this matter in may we applied million of this payment as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years results of operations total net revenue fiscal vs

fiscal vs 
fiscal in millions impairment of goodwill percentage of total net revenue loss and impairment of assets held for sale percentage of total net revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangibles  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and any time business conditions indicate a potential change in recoverability 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there were impairment indicators  including the challenging economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization  which required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
the analysis was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal and an estimated impairment charge of billion was recorded 
the analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment charge of million was included in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we incurred a total impairment charge of billion for fiscal we also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary 
for the purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  and the market approach 
the income approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows 
we also consider the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
during fiscal  and  we recognized impairments of million  million  and million  respectively  on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale 
the impairments were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires a long lived asset classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell

commissioner tax court decision see further discussion below  million tax benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation  million tax benefit from the conclusion of us and foreign audits  million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in prior periods  and million tax benefit from current year discrete events 
the change in the valuation allowance follows discussions with irish revenue in the third quarter of fiscal  the result of which accelerates the timing of the use of certain irish tax loss carryforwards in the future 
the tax expense in fiscal was materially impacted by the inclusion of a million tax benefit associated with the billion impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lower taxed foreign earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei joint venture fiscal and only  domestic manufacturing incentives  and research and development credits  partially offset by state income taxes 
as a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal  we have cumulative pre tax book losses  as measured by the current and prior two years 
we considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pre tax book loss position on our ability to continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income for realization 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  set forth in this annual report 
we considered the following as positive evidence the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax losses  we have a strong  consistent taxpaying history  we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential  and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities 
we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and  thus  that the deferred tax assets as of april  of million  after application of the valuation allowances  are realizable on a more likely than not basis 
on may   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned a us tax court ruling in xilinx v 
commissioner  holding that stock based compensation related r d must be shared by the participants of a r d cost sharing arrangement 
the ninth circuit held that related parties to such an arrangement must share stock option costs  notwithstanding the us tax court s finding that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share such costs 
symantec has a similar r d cost sharing arrangement in place 
the ninth circuit s reversal of the us tax court s decision changed our estimate of stock option related tax benefits previously recognized under the authoritative guidance on income taxes 
as a result of the ninth circuit s ruling  we increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  recording a tax expense of approximately million and a reduction of additional paid in capital of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal on january   the ninth circuit court of appeals withdrew its issued opinion 
on march   the ninth circuit court of appeals issued a revised decision affirming the decision of the tax court 
the ninth circuit s decision agreed with the tax court s finding that related companies are not required to share such costs 
as a result of the ninth circuit s revised ruling  we released the liability established in our first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a million tax benefit and increase of additional paid in capital of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  there was no net income tax expense impact 

table of contents on march   we received a notice of deficiency from the irs claiming that we owe million of additional taxes  excluding interest and penalties  for the and tax years based on an audit of veritas 
on june   we filed a petition with the us tax court protesting the irs claim for such additional taxes 
during july  we completed the trial phase of the tax court case  which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the assessment 
at trial  the irs changed its position with respect to this remaining issue  which decreased the remaining amount at issue from million to million  excluding interest 
we filed our post trial briefs in october and rebuttal briefs in november with the us tax court 
on december   the us tax court issued its opinion  finding that our transfer pricing methodology  with appropriate adjustments  was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between veritas and its offshore subsidiary 
the tax court judge provided guidance as to how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the method used by veritas 
we remeasured and decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly  resulting in a million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal final computations as directed by the ruling are not complete and  accordingly  we may make further adjustments to our tax liability in the future 
the tax court ruling is subject to appeal

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of cash we have historically relied on cash flow from operations  borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs 
in fiscal  we entered into a five year billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in july in order to be able to draw on the credit facility  we must maintain certain covenants  including a specified ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment as well as certain other non financial covenants

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal total fiscal and and and thereafter other in millions convertible senior notes interest payments on convertible senior notes purchase obligations operating leases norton royalty agreement uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations senior notes are due in fiscal and holders of the senior notes may convert their senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock  up to the principal amount of the note 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or in stock at our option 
as of april   the conditions to conversion had not been met 
interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes 
these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment 
the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and the company expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials 
we have entered into various non cancellable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through the amounts in the table above include million related to exited or excess facility costs related to restructuring activities 
in june  we amended an existing royalty agreement with peter norton for the licensing of certain publicity rights 
as a result  we recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to mr 
norton 
as of april   we reflected million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies 
indemnifications as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software 
table of contents infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  payments made under these provisions have been immaterial 
we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 
recently adopted authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments that requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument 
the debt is recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance 
the equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability 
this guidance also requires interest to be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt 
this guidance applies to the convertible senior notes due june  and the convertible senior notes due june   collectively referred to as the senior notes 
prior to the adoption of this guidance  the liability of the senior notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
because this guidance requires retrospective adoption  we were required to adjust all periods for which the senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information on the adoption 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance on business combinations that requires an acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the changes include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs  the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value  the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re measurement of such liabilities after the acquisition date  the recognition of capitalized in process research and development  the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date  and the recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance 
our acquisitions during fiscal have been accounted for using this new authoritative guidance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information on our business combinations 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  it could have a material impact on future periods 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance on the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments for debt securities that replaced the pre existing intent and ability indicator 
this guidance specifies that if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in which an entity has an intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that is  a credit loss exists 
other than temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses  which are recognized in earnings  and amounts related to all other factors  which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance on noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements  which includes requiring noncontrolling interests be classified as a component of consolidated stockholders equity and to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings 
the guidance also requires the gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance that specifies the way in which fair value measurements should be made for non financial assets and liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  and specifies additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of 
table of contents accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
the new standard establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vsoe nor tpe is available for that deliverable 
concurrently to issuing the new standard  the fasb also issued new authoritative guidance that excludes tangible products that contain software and non software elements that function together to provide the tangible products essential functionality from the scope of software revenue guidance 
we have elected to adopt the new accounting standards as of the beginning of fiscal for applicable transactions originating from or materially modified after april  our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
our joint venture also adopted the accounting standards during its period ended december   which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year 
as a result of the joint venture s adoption of the accounting standards  our loss from joint venture decreased by million during our fiscal see note for further details regarding the impact of this guidance on our joint venture 
recently issued authoritative guidance in june  the fasb issued revised guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
the standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a vie with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a vie and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive the entity s residual returns 
the statement is effective as of the first quarter of our fiscal  and early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of this new authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity prices 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in currencies through our worldwide operations and  as such  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in other income  net 
our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures 
under our program  gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts 
our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months 
at the end of the reporting period  open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net

amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or in stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately  warrant transactions  to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock 
for business and strategic purposes  we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies  many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies
