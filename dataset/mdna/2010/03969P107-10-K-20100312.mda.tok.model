this section provides a general description of recent events and significant transactions that we believe are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding commitments and contingencies that existed as of december  included in this discussion is our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of gout  cancer and hiv 
we have five product candidates in development  including rdea an inhibitor of the urat kidney transporter for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout  rdea a next generation urat transporter inhibitor for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout  rdea a mek inhibitor for the treatment of cancer  rdea a nnrti for the treatment of hiv  and rdea a next generation nnrti for the treatment of hiv 
research and development expense research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical trials of our product candidates  costs associated with our ongoing research programs  salaries and share based compensation for research and development personnel and facility costs 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
other than costs for outsourced services associated with our clinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries  share based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  business development  investor relations  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other general and administrative costs include professional fees for legal  accounting and other general corporate purposes  and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available for sale  net of interest expense 
recent developments in january  we announced additional positive results from a recently completed phase a study of rdea  as well as additional positive results from the second panel of a phase drug drug interaction and pharmacodynamic study of rdea in combination with febuxostat 
in the phase a study  of patients reached target serum urate levels with the combination of rdea and allopurinol 
in the phase study  the combination of rdea and febuxostat reduced serum urate levels in healthy volunteers by approximately 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenues  accrued clinical liabilities and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our collaboration arrangements may contain multiple elements and we may be eligible for payments made in the form of upfront license fees  research funding  cost reimbursement  milestone payments and downstream royalties 
revenue from upfront  nonrefundable license fees is recognized over the period that any related services are provided 
amounts received for research funding are recognized as revenues as the research services that are the subject of such funding are performed 
revenue derived from reimbursement of research and development costs in transactions where we act as a principal are recorded as revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement  and the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
revenues recognized for royalty payments  if any  will be based upon actual net sales of the licensed compounds  as provided by the collaboration arrangement  in the period the sales occur 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents accrued clinical liabilities we review and accrue clinical costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred 
clinical trial related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  based on milestones or deliverables  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation we grant equity based awards under three stockholder approved  share based compensation plans 
we have granted  and may in the future grant  options and restricted stock awards to employees  directors  consultants and advisors under either our non officer equity incentive plan or our stock incentive plan 
in addition  all of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan which enables employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton  or black scholes  option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including each option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
expected volatility is based on the weighted average volatility of our stock  factoring in daily share price observations and the historical price volatility of certain peers within our industry sector 
in computing expected volatility  the length of the historical period used is equal to the length of the expected term of the option and the share purchase right 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period  as permitted under the simplified method 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
changes in assumptions used under the black scholes option valuation model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  the revenue earned in primarily resulted from the recognition of a portion of the upfront  non refundable license fee and reimbursement of third party development costs associated with our mek inhibitor program under the terms of the license agreement with bayer 
the million upfront license fee has been recognized on a straight line basis over a period of approximately months  which was the original period in which we expected to complete all of our obligations under the license agreement 
in december  we revised our estimate of this period extending it to months as a result of design modifications to our ongoing rdea clinical trials 
the unamortized balance of the license fee as of the date of the change in estimate will be recognized over the revised timeline 
the revenue earned in fiscal resulted from the research services we provided under our master services agreement with valeant  which has since terminated by its terms 

table of contents research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to a decrease in spending of approximately million mainly due to reduced discovery research and clinical development expenditures as we focus our resources on our gout related programs  rdea and rdea research and development expense also decreased approximately million as a result of savings from our may restructuring 
in addition  the decrease was a result of approximately million in one time facility related expenses incurred in the first quarter of in connection with our facility relocation and decreased monthly rent and common area maintenance charges for the san diego facility  which we occupied beginning in march these decreases were partially offset by severance related charges of approximately million recorded in in connection with our may restructuring 
in addition  research and development expense was also partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million in as compared to general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of one time costs of approximately million incurred in related to the facility relocation 
in addition  the decrease in general and administrative expense was the result of a decrease in consulting and professional outside services of approximately million and a decrease in personnel and related costs due to a decrease in headcount of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million in as compared to other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense decreased to million net other expense from million net other income for the same period in the decrease in other income expense was primarily a result of an increase in interest expense in connection with our growth capital loan and capital lease obligations entered into in the second half of and a decrease in interest income due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances as compared to years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   revenues decreased to million from million for the year ended december  revenues earned in and resulted from the research services we provided under our master services agreement with valeant for its preclinical neuropharmacology program 
the decrease in revenues from levels was due to the earlier than anticipated identification of a clinical development candidate from that program and valeant s subsequent reduction in the utilization of our research and development services 
the master services agreement has since terminated by its terms 
research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to continued development and progression of our clinical and preclinical programs  which included increased spending of approximately million on clinical research organizations  professional outside services  and research and clinical trial supplies and materials for the year ended december  in addition  the increase in research and development expense was a result of additional personnel costs of approximately million and an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  resulting from increased headcount in as compared to 
table of contents general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily the result of higher share based compensation expense of approximately million and additional personnel costs of approximately million due to increased headcount in as compared to other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in other income expense was primarily a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances for as compared to  as well as increased interest expense in associated with our growth capital loan  tenant improvements loan and capital lease obligation entered into in there were no comparable obligations in liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million  of which million was incurred subsequent to the closing of the asset acquisition from valeant and the commencement of operating activities as ardea biosciences  inc we have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenues from collaborative arrangements  proceeds from our growth capital loan and interest income from invested cash balances 
in may  we committed to a restructuring plan the restructuring plan intended to conserve our financial resources by focusing on our clinical stage programs 
in combination with other employee attrition since january   the restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of approximately of our workforce with the majority coming from discovery research and associated administrative personnel 
estimated cost savings from the restructuring plan  net of severance and related costs  were approximately million in and are expected to be approximately million per year thereafter 
in april  we entered into the license agreement with bayer 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have granted to bayer a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize our mek inhibitors for all indications 
in partial consideration for the license  bayer paid us a non refundable upfront cash fee of million 
we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales based milestones  as well as low double digit royalties on worldwide sales of products covered under the license agreement 
in december  we raised million by selling  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a total purchase price of approximately per unit  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on january   we filed a registration statement with the sec covering the resale of these shares and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  in november  we entered into an agreement with oxford finance corporation and silicon valley bank  collectively  the lenders  pursuant to which the lenders provided us with an approximately three year  million growth capital loan 
interest accrues at a rate of per annum  with monthly interest only payments required during a period that began on the loan funding date and continued through february   followed thereafter by equal monthly payments of principal and interest over a period of months 
in addition  we are required to pay a total loan commitment fee of approximately million  of which million was paid upon entering into the loan agreement and the remaining million is due at the end of the term of the loan 
we have the option to prepay in full the outstanding balance of the loan  subject to a prepayment fee 
the loan is collateralized by our general assets  excluding intellectual property 
there are no financial covenants associated with the loan 
in connection with the loan  we issued to the lenders warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in september  silicon valley bank exercised its warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock using the conversion right provision in the warrant agreement  
table of contents which resulted in the net issuance of  shares of common stock and no net cash proceeds to us 
the remaining warrants are currently exercisable and expire seven years from the date of issuance 
in july  we entered into a capital lease agreement for approximately  to finance the purchase of certain equipment 
the agreement is secured by the equipment  bears interest at per annum  and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  for months beginning in september in march  we exercised our right under our sublease agreement to borrow from the sublessor approximately  for costs incurred and paid for certain tenant improvements 
the note evidencing the borrowings bears interest at per annum and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  for months beginning in june as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and million in receivables  compared to million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and million in receivables as of december  the net decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and receivables for was primarily due to the use of cash to fund our clinical stage programs  personnel costs and for other general corporate purposes  partially offset by the receipt of a million non refundable  upfront license fee and the reimbursement of third party development costs associated with our mek inhibitor program under the license agreement with bayer 
under the asset purchase agreement with valeant  we will be required to pay valeant million after the first patient is dosed in the first phase b study for the nnrti program and million after the first patient is dosed in the first phase b study for the mek inhibitor program 
we also enter into agreements from time to time with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
under certain of these agreements  we may be subject to penalties in the event that we prematurely terminate these agreements 
at this time  due to the variability associated with clinical site and contract research organization agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur 
we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our obligations under these commitments 
in addition  we entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees that  under certain cases  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if these executives or employees are terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when we have met our obligations under these agreements 
in connection with our restructuring plan  one of these employees  who was terminated during the second quarter of  will receive continuation of salary and other benefits until april as required by an employment agreement 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term debt and capital lease obligations include interest 
payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total at december   purchase obligations primarily consisted of commitments with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in our clinical and preclinical studies 
approximately million of the total purchase obligations were not included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our commitments under these purchase obligations 

table of contents our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development programs we pursue  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating activities through the first quarter of this current financial projection includes forecasted expenses associated with completing the rdea phase development program 
this projection does not include forecasted expenses for phase development of rdea  the receipt of milestone payments under our license agreement with bayer  proceeds from future partnering activities or financings  or payments to valeant under our asset purchase agreement 
we have no current means of generating material cash flows from operations 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts with respect to any of our product candidates will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that any products  if introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve commercial acceptance 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings and corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
our ability to obtain new financing may be constrained by volatile economic conditions currently affecting financial markets 
if we do not generate sufficient additional funding in  we will postpone the initiation of the rdea phase development program in order to meet our working capital requirements through december  and thereafter 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  changes in our consolidated financial condition  expenses  consolidated results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we owned financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk  including interest rate risk  as part of our investment portfolio 
to minimize our exposure to market risk  we have generally limited our investments to cash and securities of the government of the united states of america and its federal agencies  or high grade corporate debt securities with maturity dates of less than one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates over the nine month period following december  would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio as of december  we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
we also do not invest in any derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments  auction rate securities or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions
