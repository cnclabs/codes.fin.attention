item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical and surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
when used in combination  our products and services provide healthcare facilities with a comprehensive solution designed to enhance patient safety and improve operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
approximately of our product revenue is from outside the united states and canada  although we believe adoption of our products internationally will increase in future years 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
we have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the us department of state  or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
we continued purchasing sub assemblies at a few single source off shore manufacturing suppliers to provide increased manufacturing capacity 
in  we established a subsidiary in india  omnicell corporation india private limited 
this subsidiary is focused on software product development and customer support 
a substantial number of our u 
s employees involved in sales  customer support and installation work remotely 
in general  we recognize revenue when our systems are installed 
for all of our products except mobile carts  installation generally takes place two weeks to nine months after our systems are ordered 
installation of mobile carts takes place one to three months after the order is received 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with integrating large capital expenditures and time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer s pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  timing of customer installations  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
our revenue declined from million in to million in due to the economic downturn and healthcare facilities subsequent reduction in their capital spending 
we believe that the economic downturn is temporary and that spending in the healthcare industry and demand for our 
table of contents products will increase in the future 
we believe that the following four factors will be responsible for the demand for our products the overall market demand for healthcare services will increase as the population grows  life expectancies continue to increase  the quality of healthcare services increases and the availability of healthcare services increases  the environment of increased patient safety awareness  increased regulatory control and increased need for workflow efficiency through the adoption of technology in the healthcare industry has driven our solutions to be a high priority in the capital budgets of healthcare facilities  we have continued to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to provide the best customer experience in the healthcare industry  and we have delivered industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses  pharmacists  supply chain managers  chief information officers and hospital management 
our product backlog  consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  increased from million at december  to million at december  while our customers experienced a challenging financial environment caused by macroeconomic conditions  which contributed to decreasing investment returns  decreasing hospital foundation donations and increasing costs of financing  we believe the macroeconomic environment that caused our customers to postpone their acquisition decisions began to improve in the latter half of even with this positive development  however  we are likely to continue experiencing delays in closing contracts until economic conditions appreciably improve 
in addition  in we saw our order mix shift towards larger institutions and replacement of systems sold by our competitors  which caused increased variability in our order rates and size of orders and may cause increased variability in the timing of future revenues 
we expect to operate through with backlog within our objective of six to nine months of forward revenue but we believe there will be variation from time to time in the total dollar value of orders in backlog 
we believe that our key business strategies are a significant component to our success in achieving market acceptance of our products and services 
these key strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer needs  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceeding our customers installation and support needs 
sustaining technological leadership in the development of our products by consistently innovating our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
in order to implement these strategies during  we increased our field organizations as a percentage of our total staff to foster better customer service  continued to announce and deliver new proprietary product offerings such as anywhere rn  tissue tracking  central pharmacy software solutions and enhanced operating features for anesthesiologists  and 
table of contents continued our strategy to manufacture sub assemblies at manufacturing supplier locations  providing us the potential for increased manufacturing capacity  increased flexibility  and reduced demands on working capital 
long term liabilities were million in  up from million in this is principally composed of long term deferred service revenue  which was million in  up from million in our deferred service revenue will be amortized to service revenue as the service contracts are executed 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million primarily due to lower accounts receivable  increased deferred service contracts and net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation  amortization and share based compensation 
in  we generated negative overall cash flow of million  mainly due to million in repurchases of our common stock 
net cash provided by operations continued to be positive for the fourth consecutive year at million for the year ended december  and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million 
we expect cash provided by operations to remain positive in in the first quarter of  we reduced our headcount significantly to align our business with overall demand for our products 
consequently  our full time headcount declined from on december  to on december  we record compensation costs of share based awards  options and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with asc  stock compensation formerly referred to as sfas no 
r 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million 
the impact on net income per share for the year ended december  was per share basic and per share diluted 
we anticipate that the growth rate of our expenses from share based compensation  may  at times  exceed the future growth rate of our revenues 
our gross profit decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to lower revenue during gross margin decreased by percentage points to for  primarily due to product mix changes and higher cost of services 
we believe that our gross margins could decline further in as a result of market price reductions  additional costs to expand our business and expenses from share based compensation 
this decrease could be partially offset by improved efficiency in our field operations and lowered component and subassembly costs from ongoing supplier management programs 
net income of our business declined during due to lower gross profit  as discussed above  and a reduction in interest income from cash balances 
we also recorded a million restructuring charge  net of tax  from a workforce reduction in the first quarter of there was no corresponding charge during restructuring costs related primarily to severance pay  continuation of benefits and outplacement services 
we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our management team evaluates our profit performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
table of contents reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our hardware products are integrated with software that is essential to their functionality 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with asc  software formerly referred to as statement of position no 

for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
product delivery 
software and hardware delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter in instances of a customer self installed installation 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
in general  for sales not requiring our installation or modification  we recognize sales on delivery of products to our customers 
we recognize sales on shipment to distributors since we do not have further installation obligations and we do not allow for rights of return 
we separately sell training and professional services which are not part of multiple element arrangements and not integral to the performance of our systems 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
vsoe of training and of professional services is based on the price paid when sold separately 

table of contents we generally sell our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis and recognize revenue on these leases at the net present value of the lease payment stream 
we exclude from revenue any payments we receive for a new sale that relate to the termination of an existing lease 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease is sold 
some of our lease sales  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house as sales type leases which we account for in accordance with asc  leases formerly referred to as sfas no 

we recognize product related revenue  based on the net present value of the future lease payment streams  for sales type leases as our installation obligations are met  if any 
interest income in sales type leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for allowances 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly referred to as sfas no 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain purchased intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  which approximate the first in  first out method or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on a 
table of contents combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions asc accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes formerly referred to as sfas no 

this standard prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against net deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management performs assessments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
these assessments require that management make significant judgments and evaluations of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
we also recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on our corporate income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards in july  the fasb released the final version of its new accounting standards codification codification as the single authoritative source for gaap 
while not intended to change gaap  the codification significantly changes the way in which the accounting literature is organized  combining all authoritative standards into a comprehensive  topically organized database 
all existing accounting standard documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered nonauthoritative  other than guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after september  we adopted the codification in our interim financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal  which had no impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r has been codified as asc  business combinations  and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the accounting standard also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
asc is effective for all future business combination transactions and will differ from the accounting we used for prior acquisitions 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
r  accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  or fsp fas r fsp fas r amends the provisions in asc  business combinations  for the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
fsp fas r is effective for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not 
table of contents expect the adoption of fsp fas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements unless and until we complete a business combination 
in april  the fasb issued three related staff positions fsp i fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  or fsp fas  ii fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  or fsp fas  and iii fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or fsp fas  which will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  fsp fas provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
fsp fas modifies asc  investments debt and equity securities  in requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and revises the existing impairment model for such securities  by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp fas enhances the disclosure of instruments under the scope of asc  financial instruments  for both interim and annual periods 
our adoption of these staff positions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 subsequent events  which was codified as asc  subsequent events 
asc requires an entity to disclose the date through which the entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether that evaluation date is the date financial statements are issued for public entities or the date the financial statements were available to be issued for nonpublic entities that do not widely distribute their financial statements 
asc is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  our adoption of asc did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued two sfas which will become effective for annual reporting periods that begin after november  these are sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
sfas no 
removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from asc  transfers and servicing  and requires that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained and all liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
sfas no 
 codified in asc  consolidation  requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
neither of these new standards are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards updates and  or asu and asu  which amended asc  revenue recognition  and asc  software  respectively 
asu requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
asu revises the guidance regarding the types of arrangements that fall under the scope of the software recognition guidance  providing a scope exception for many transactions that were previously within the scope of asc  including tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality and places them under asc  thus requiring the new multiple element revenue allocation under asu both asu and asu are 
table of contents effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  earlier application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these asus on our consolidated financial statements 
we expect that our adoption of these asus will require substantial amounts of management s time and attention and may result in increased operating expenses

table of contents compared to product revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of installations of medication and supply automation systems and central pharmacy products  from both existing and new customers in our us domestic markets which was due to general economic conditions affecting hospital capital purchasing 
cost of product revenues decreased by million  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in product revenue resulting in a million decrease in direct standard cost  and a decrease in spending of million which was driven by lower headcount as a result of restructuring charges relating to our workforce reduction in the first quarter of and associated headcount related expenses such as travel 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in other costs  primarily related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross profit on product revenue decreased by million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of lower product revenues 
gross margin as a percent of revenues was compared to in direct product margins increased due to both product mix and better supply management 
this increase was offset by increases in other costs primarily due to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and increased depreciation expenses related to the implementation of our new accounting and materials system 
in addition  we incurred a million restructuring charge in the first quarter of we expect revenues to stabilize for and we do not anticipate any major fluctuations in our gross margin beyond normal fluctuations caused by changes in product mix 
compared to product revenues increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in product revenue was primarily due to increased installations due to increased unit volume sales of medication and supply automation systems and central pharmacy products from existing customer relationships and increased unit volume sales across our entire product line from new customer relationships 
new product features  the overall hospital medication safety regulatory environment and an increased interest in automation products in hospitals contributed to these increases 
cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an million increase in direct material cost and manufacturing costs associated with increasing volume unit sales and with changes in our product mix  including the addition of our new mobile carts product line  a million increase in labor costs and million increase in support expenses 
gross profit on product revenue increased by million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of higher product revenues 
product margin decreased slightly due to the addition of our mobile carts product line and expansion of our central pharmacy product line  both of which have higher costs  as a percentage of revenue  limiting the overall margin growth 
service and other revenues  cost of service and other revenues and gross profit service and other revenues include revenues from service and maintenance contracts and rentals of automation systems

cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in spare parts usage to support the larger installed base 
gross profit on service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase in gross margin on service and other revenues was due primarily to faster revenue growth from an expanded installed base without a proportionate increase in labor costs to support the expanded install base 
we expect our service and other revenues and the associated gross profit to increase for in line with the continued expansion of installed base of automation systems and service and maintenance contracts coupled with continued cost controls 
compared to service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increases in service and other revenues was primarily due to the result of an expansion in our installed base of automation systems and a resulting increase in number of support service contracts 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to million increase in labor costs in support of the expanded service base and to continue to increase customer satisfaction  including a million stock compensation charge associated with asc  a million increase in spare parts associated with increased volumes and a million increase in support costs 
gross profit on service and other revenues decreased by million  or  in as compared to gross margin on service and other revenues declined by percentage points to as we were unable to increase service revenue proportionately to the higher service costs 
this was due primarily to a concentrated effort to maintain high customer satisfaction with our service organization 

table of contents operating expenses the table below shows our operating expenses for the years ended december   and and the percentage change between those years percentage change for the years ended december  to to in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses compared to research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to a million increase in capitalized software  primarily due to the development of two major releases of our software used in our products  which moved expenditures from expenses to capital projects  offset by an increase of million in outside services 
since we compete against much larger competitors with more expansive research and development budgets  we expect research and development expenses to increase as a percent of revenue in order to maintain competitive products in the marketplace 
the amount of research and development expense can fluctuate based on the amount of proto type expenses for hardware and or the amount of software development expense capitalized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million of decreases associated with lower sales volume and headcount  a decrease of million in bad debt expense associated with the decrease in accounts receivable balances  and a decrease of million in expenses related to share based compensation charges associated with asc these decreases were partially offset by increased investment in the marketing of our products 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs to increase modestly in  but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
restructuring charges 
the decrease in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in was partially the result of restructuring charges of million relating to our work force reduction during the first quarter of  which lowered headcount by employees 
restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of related primarily to severance pay  continuation of benefits and outplacement services 
there were no comparable charges in prior years 
compared to research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to a million increase in labor expenses  including a million increase in 
table of contents expenses related to share based compensation charges associated with asc and a million increase in support costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
in  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in labor expenses  offset by a million decrease in share based compensation charges associated with asc  and a million increase in support expenses  including a million increase in facility expenses  million increase in depreciation expenses  both reflecting our expansion to a new administrative building  million one time charge related to the lease termination of our facility in elgin  south carolina  as well as hardware related information technology infrastructure investments 
there was also a million increase in postage and freight expenses and a million increase in travel expenses  both reflecting increase in fuel costs throughout interest income and other expense the table below shows our interest income and other expense for the years ended december   and and the percentage change between those years for the years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands interest income other expense the decrease in interest income for as compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest income for as compared to was primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances as a result of million in stock repurchases completed in the first and second quarters of and the impact of lower interest rates in as compared to we expect interest income to remain at approximately levels during as interest rates stabilize 
income taxes years ended december  in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  compared to million and effective tax rate for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to one time tax adjustments of approximately million for prior year research and development tax credits and the re measurement of our california deferred tax assets due to the enactment of california tax legislation 
the increase in the provision for income taxes from to was primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the effective tax rate is a more normalized rate and is reflective of what management expects in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows the table below shows our cash flows for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in to million from the amount of million 
the major driver of this increase was lower accounts receivable due to increased collections  resulting in a net change between the years of million 
other sources of cash were balance sheet changes in accrued liabilities and other current assets  adding million and million  respectively  of additional operating cash flows in compared to offsetting these increases in sources of operating cash flows were lower net income of million and a combination of tax related operating cash flows that reduced cash provided by operating activities between and by million 
the largest tax related item was a benefit from employee stock plans which changed from a source of operating cash in to a use of operating cash in for a net reduction of cash provided of million 
this was offset by increases in cash provided by deferred income taxes  which changed from a use of operating cash in to a source of operating cash in  of million and a reduction of use of operating cash by excess tax benefits from employee stock plans of million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in to million from the amount of million 
this was primarily due to lower purchases of capital assets 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million in to million from the amount of net cash used in financing activities of million 
this was primarily due to the absence of stock repurchases in as compared to stock repurchases in totaling million 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in to million from the amount of million 
the major drivers of this decrease were lower net income of million and growing accounts receivable  increasing operating cash usage in by million as compared to offsetting these decreases in sources of operating cash flows were a combination of tax related operating cash flows that increased cash provided by operating activities between and by million  balance sheet changes in accrued liabilities  which reduced operating cash usage by million  and increased depreciation and amortization charges of million 
the largest tax related item was a decrease in operating cash used by deferred income taxes of million 
significant swings in operating cash provided in from operating cash provided in was also seen in income tax benefits from employee stock plans  adding million  and in excess tax benefits from employee stock plans  reducing operating cash flows by million 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in to million from the amount of million 
this was primarily due to the million use of cash in for the acquisition of rioux vision  offset by million increased purchases of capital assets in net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million in to a net use of cash from financing activities of million from the net source of cash of million 
this was primarily due to the absence of the million proceeds from our public offering of common stock coupled with stock repurchases totaling million in liquidity our future uses of cash are expected to be primarily for working capital  capital expenditures and other contractual obligations 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  as compared to million at december  based on our current business plan and revenue backlog  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and other contractual obligations for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the instructions thereto 
contractual obligations as of december  we had million in contractual commitments to third parties for non cancelable operating leases  commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers and other purchase commitments 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information with respect to these commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers total commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property and office equipment
