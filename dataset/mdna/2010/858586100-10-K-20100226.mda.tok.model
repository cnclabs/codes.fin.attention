item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the company operates in a cyclical industry and the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially from the results presented below 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  outcomes of environmental contingencies  availability of raw materials  the ability to pass on raw material price increases  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  body washes  toothpastes and fabric softeners 
other applications include germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products  plastics and composites and biodiesel 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the us and one in canada  three european sites united kingdom  france and germany and three latin american sites mexico  brazil and colombia 
the company holds a percent ownership interest in two joint ventures  stepan philippines and tiorco  llc  that are excluded from surfactant segment operating results 
the joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  include two primary product lines polyols and phthalic anhydride 
polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers case industries 
phthalic anhydride is used in unsaturated polyester resins  alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at the company s millsdale  illinois  site 
polyols are also manufactured at the company s wesseling cologne  germany facility  as well as at its percent owned joint venture in nanjing  china which is included in consolidated results 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for three percent of consolidated net sales for  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at the company s maywood  new jersey  site 

table of contents despite the continued challenges of the global economic recession  the company achieved record net income for the year ended december  the economic slowdown continued to negatively affect sales volume  which was down eight percent year over year 
sales volume for the company s polymers segment fell percent behind last year s levels  as activity in the industries into which the segment sells roofing insulation  construction materials  automotive and recreational vehicles  etc 
was down 
management expects polymer sales volume recovery to be slow 
the recession has had a lesser effect on sales volume for the surfactants segment  as surfactants used in cleaning compounds have historically been more recession resistant 
consolidated surfactant sales volume dropped seven percent between years primarily as a result of lower volumes for biodiesel and construction and oilfield applications 
sales volume for the company s largest market segment  consumer laundry and personal care  slightly exceeded levels 
lower year over year raw material costs  resulting from the effects of the economic recession on commodities  benefited all segments  as the effect of lower costs more than offset the effect of lower sales volume 
during the second half of  the costs of crude and natural oils and their derivative products began to rise  prompting management to increase selling prices for many of the company s surfactant and polymer products 
during  the company also implemented cost saving initiatives to reduce spending for items such as overtime  travel and entertainment  outside consulting and temporary help 
deferred compensation plans the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans can cause period to period fluctuations in company expenses and profits 
for  compensation expense related to the company s deferred compensation plans  which is reported in the administrative expense line of the consolidated income statement  was million and million higher than deferred compensation expense reported for and  respectively 
the company common stock price  to which a large portion of the deferred compensation obligation is tied  was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the pretax effect of all deferred compensation related activities which includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund assets held to fund the deferred compensation obligations and the income statement line items in which the effects were recorded are displayed below see the corporate expenses section of this management discussion and analysis for further details

effects of foreign currency translation the company s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies 
as a result  foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into us dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period 
because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the us dollar over time  foreign currency translation affects period to period comparisons of financial statement items ie because foreign exchange rates fluctuate  similar period to period local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different us dollar results 
for the year ending december   the us dollar strengthened against nearly all the foreign currencies in the locations where the company does business  when compared to the exchange rates for year ending december  consequently  reported net sales  expense and income amounts for were lower than they would have been had the foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with the rates for conversely  for the year ending december   the us dollar weakened against nearly all the foreign currencies in the locations where the company does business  when compared to the exchange rates for year ending december  below are tables that present the impact that foreign currency translation had on the changes in consolidated net sales and various income line items for compared to and for compared to year ended december increase decrease inc dec due to foreign translation in millions net sales gross profit operating income pretax income 
table of contents the year ended december increase decrease inc dec due to foreign translation in millions net sales gross profit operating income pretax income significant transactions during the reporting period a number of events having significant effects on the company s results of operations occurred in and the following are descriptions of those events sale of commodity polyurethane systems product lines on july   the company sold select polyurethane system product lines  which were a part of the polymer segment  to bayer materialscience llc bayer 
no manufacturing assets were included in the sale and no employees were terminated 
the sold product lines were insulation materials used in appliances  water heaters  doors  roofs  picnic coolers and other similar applications  and represented approximately million in company annual net sales 
the products  which are manufactured at the company s millsdale  illinois  facility  continue to be produced for bayer during a transition period of up to two years 
the sale was for million of cash  which the company reported as a pretax gain in the third quarter ended september  the company continues to produce and sell polyurethane systems for specialty applications 
see note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sale of land in september  the company sold acres of land at its millsdale manufacturing facility in elwood  illinois  to an industrial park developer for million 
the land had a cost basis of million  so the company recorded a pretax gain of million in the third quarter ended september  the gain was not attributed to any reportable segment

results of operations compared with summary net income for improved percent to a record million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for prior year net income benefited from million net of tax of gains on the previously discussed sales of the polyurethane systems product lines and millsdale land 
below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales declined million  or percent  between years 
a decline in average selling prices  lower sales volume and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the year to year decrease in net sales 
sales volumes fell eight percent  reflecting the effects of the global recession 
by segment  polymer and surfactant sales volumes dropped percent and seven percent  respectively  while sales volume for specialty products was up nine percent year over year 
the decline in average selling prices was principally the result of falling commodity raw material costs 
operating income for was million  or percent  greater than operating income for despite the million and million gains reported on the sales of the polyurethane product lines and millsdale land  respectively 
gross profit was up million  or percent 
all three segments contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
surfactants segment gross profit was up million  or percent  polymers segment gross profit increased million  or percent  and gross profit for the specialty products segment was up million  or percent 
lower raw material and freight costs and company cost reduction initiatives benefited all segments 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year to year consolidated gross profit improvement by approximately million 

table of contents operating expenses increased million  or percent  between years 
major items accounting for the expense increase were as follows dollars in millions increase decrease gain on sale of product lines gain on sale of land deferred compensation expense incentive based compensation foreign currency translation transition pension expense legal environmental expense other total the gains on sales of product lines and land are explained in the overview section of this md a 
the increase in deferred compensation expense is discussed in detail in the corporate expenses section of this md a 
improved operating results caused the rise in incentive based compensation  which includes stock based pay  bonuses and profit sharing 
the decline in transition pension expense was principally attributable to a acceleration of a portion of discretionary company contributions established to compensate certain employees for benefits lost when the company froze its defined benefit plans in no such accelerated benefits were paid in 
legal environmental expenses were up mainly due to increases in estimated environmental remediation reserve requirements for existing sites 
interest expense for was million  or percent  less than interest expense for lower average debt levels  resulting from a decrease in working capital requirements brought on by lower raw material costs  led to the decline 
the loss from equity joint ventures  which includes results for the percent owned spi and tiorco joint ventures  increased million  or percent  between years 
spi reported an equity loss of million for  which was million less than the loss reported in the the current year included million of expense to reserve for value added tax receivable balances that are in dispute with philippine tax authorities 
tiorco  which was formed in september  reported million of equity loss  which was million higher than the loss reported in planned start up expenses coupled with lower prices for crude oil in the first six months of caused the tiorco result 
other  net was million of income for compared to million of expense for a million favorable swing in investment related income  partially offset by a million decline in foreign exchange gains  accounted for the million year to year favorable other  net change 
unrealized and realized gains related to the mutual funds held for the company s deferred compensation plans accounted for the year to year change in investment related income as million of gains were posted in compared to losses of million for dividend income declined million between years 
foreign exchange activity resulted in million of gains for compared to million of gains for the same period of the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a greater percentage of consolidated 
table of contents income being generated in the us where the effective tax rate is higher and the reduction of the tax benefit realized on tax credits and deductions as percentage of income

a year to year comparison of net sales by region follows for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase decrease percent change north america europe latin america total surfactants segment 
table of contents the percent decline in net sales for north american operations was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in sales volume and a nine percent decline in average selling prices  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales change 
in addition  the effects of foreign currency translation contributed million or one percent to the decline 
a significant drop in biodiesel sales volume accounted for about percent of the total decrease in north american volume 
the remaining decrease in sales volume reflected reduced demand for surfactants that have industrial or construction applications  which were negatively impacted by the poor economy 
the company continued to focus its manufacturing resources on more profitable opportunities because of the current unprofitable economic environment for biodiesel 
sales volumes for consumer products  the regions largest market segment  dropped less than one percent despite the difficult economy 
sales of surfactants used in agricultural applications rose eight percent 
the decrease in average selling prices reflected lower raw material costs 
net sales for european operations declined percent due to the effects of foreign currency translation and an eight percent decrease in average selling prices  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales decline 
the foreign currency impact was caused by the weakening of the european euro and the uk pound sterling against the us dollar 
lower raw material costs led to the decline in average selling prices 
sales volume rose one percent between years  mitigating the net sales decline by million 
net sales for latin american operations declined percent due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation and a five percent decline in average selling prices  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease 
the currencies for all three latin american locations weakened against the us dollar  causing the currency translation impact 
the lower average selling prices were attributable to sales mix and lower raw material costs 
sales volume was up two percent from year to year  which offset the net sales decline by million 
increased sales volume for the company s brazil subsidiary  partially offset by declines at the company s mexico and colombia subsidiaries  led to the modest volume gain 
surfactants operating income for was million greater than operating income for gross profit increased million due principally to lower raw material costs 
reduced freight expenses and cost reduction initiatives also contributed to the profit improvement 
operating expenses increased million  or two percent

table of contents the year over year increase in gross profit for north american operations was largely attributable to the effects of reduced raw material costs 
lower freight costs and cost saving initiatives also contributed to the improved profitability 
the impact of the economic recession moved raw material costs lower since the end of the third quarter of when costs were at their peak 
lower fuel costs led to the lower freight expenses 
the previously discussed percent decline in sales volume partially offset the effect of the lower costs 
the improvement in gross profit for european operations was due to the positive impact of lower raw material and freight costs 
a more favorable product mix  which reflected increased fabric softener sales  and the slight sales volume increase  also contributed 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced europe s year to year profit improvement by approximately million 
gross profit for latin american operations declined due to a million negative effect of foreign currency translation and a less favorable mix of sales 
the modest increase in sales volume and lower raw material costs partially offset the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation and sales mix 
operating expenses for the surfactants segment were up million  or two percent  between years 
the expense increase was primarily attributable to a million increase for european operations reflecting higher marketing million  administrative million and research and development million expenses 
increased bad debt provisions and salary expense accounted for the higher marketing expenses 
statutory profit sharing and business tax expenses led to the higher administrative expenses 
higher regulatory compliance costs caused the increase in research and development expenses 
operating expenses for north american operations increased million due in large part to higher incentive based compensation  reflecting the strong profitability of the region 
partially offsetting the foregoing increases were reduced operating expenses for latin american operations million  due in large part to lower bad debt provisions 
the effects of foreign currency translation decreased the year to year surfactants segment operating expenses by million 
polymers polymers net sales for declined million  or percent  from net sales for a percent drop in sales volume  driven by the global economic recession  lower average selling prices and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales decline

table of contents net sales for north american operations fell percent due to a percent decrease in sales volume coupled with a percent decrease in average selling prices 
the reductions in sales volume and average selling prices accounted for million and million of the net sales decline  respectively 
sales volume for polyols and phthalic anhydride fell percent and five percent  respectively  as a result of the negative impact of the economy 
sales volume for polyurethane systems fell percent as a result of the july sale of the company s commodity system product lines 
the percent decrease in average selling prices for north american operations reflected lower raw material costs  particularly for phthalic anhydride 
net sales for european operations declined percent due to a percent drop in average selling prices  a five percent decrease in polyol sales volume and the effects of foreign currency translation  which accounted for million  million and million  respectively  of the reduction in net sales 
lower raw material costs led to the drop in average selling prices 
the decrease in sales volume reflected the negative effects that the global recession had on rigid insulation board end users  particularly in the first half of the year 
sales volumes for the second half of were up percent from the same period of asia and other operations net sales were up two percent from year to year due to increased sales volume for the china joint venture partially offset by a decline in average selling prices brought on by lower raw material costs 
polymer operating income for declined million from operating income reported in gross profit increased million  or percent  due principally to improved second half profitability resulting from raw material costs that fell from the historically high levels of a year ago 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the improvement in gross profit by about million 
operating expenses increased million as expenses included the million gain on the sale of the polyurethane systems product lines

table of contents gross profit for north american operations improved percent due to the positive impact of lower raw material costs that more than offset the effects of lower sales volume 
raw material costs rose significantly throughout the first three quarters of  resulting in profit margin erosion 
raw material prices dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of as the effects of the economic recession moved commodity prices downward 
lower freight expenses  caused by lower fuel costs  also contributed to the year over year gross profit improvement 
gross profit for european operations increased percent despite the five percent drop in sales volume due primarily to the effects of raw material cost declines caused by the global recession 
the negative effect of foreign currency translation tempered the gross profit improvement by million 
the million increase in operating expenses was due to the positive effect that the prior year gain on the product line sale had on third quarter expenses 
other expenses were essentially unchanged between years 
specialty products net sales for were million  or three percent  higher than net sales for higher sales volumes for all product lines led to the improvement in net sales 
operating income was up million  or percent  between years due to higher sales volumes  lower raw material costs  an improved sales mix resulting from increased sales of high margin pharmaceutical products and lower plant costs due to the restructuring activities completed in and corporate expenses corporate expenses  which comprise expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  increased million  or percent  to million for from million for the following table depicts the major items that accounted for the year to year increase in corporate expenses dollars in millions increase decrease gain on land sale a deferred compensation b legal environmental c incentive based compensation d electric contract fair value loss e other total a reflects the gain on the sale of acres of the millsdale manufacturing facility s land 
no such gains were reported in b due to increases in the values of company common stock and the mutual fund assets to which the company s deferred compensation obligations are tied 
the value of company common stock increased per share  from per share at december   to per share at december

results of operations compared with summary net income for improved percent to a record million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for all reportable segments reported net sales increases 
higher average selling prices and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
the recovery of higher raw material costs was the principal driver for the increase in average selling prices 
a more favorable customer and product mix of sales also contributed 
sales volume fell two percent between years  which reduced the growth in net sales by million 
the lower sales volume was primarily due to lower phthalic anhydride and biodiesel volume  whereas higher margin products posted sales volume growth 
specialty products was the sole segment reporting an increase in sales volumes  as surfactants and polymers posted volume declines of one percent and two percent  respectively 
operating income for was million  or percent  greater than operating income 
gross profit was up million  or percent  for the same period 
the surfactants segment accounted for essentially all the growth in gross profit 
a favorable customer and product mix coupled with selling price increases that continued to recover margin lost in prior years due to rising raw material costs caused the surfactants result 
gross profit for the specialty products segment was up slightly 
lower sales volume and higher raw material and production costs led to a decline in polymer gross profit 

table of contents operating expenses declined million  or seven percent 
the following accounted for the decline dollars in millions increase decrease gain on sale of systems product lines gain on sale of land goodwill impairment deferred compensation expense consulting and professional fees transition pension expense foreign currency translation salaries provision for bad debts incentive based compensation gain on sale of esters product line other total see the overview section of this management discussion and analysis for an explanation of the noted item 
the reduction in deferred compensation expense reflected a large drop in the market values of mutual funds held for the deferred compensation plans  which was somewhat mitigated by a per share increase in the price of company common stock see the critical accounting policies section of this management discussion and analysis for an explanation of the accounting treatment for the company s deferred compensation plans 
the increase in defined contribution transition pension expense was principally attributable to a board of directors approved acceleration of a portion of discretionary company contributions established to compensate certain employees for benefits lost when the company froze its defined benefit plans in consolidated pension transition expense was up million between years  million was allocated to cost of sales 
the increase in bad debt expense reflected provision increases for specific customers and reserves for non specific accounts 
improved operating results led to the rise in incentive based compensation  which includes stock based pay  bonuses and profit sharing 
the other category primarily comprises the culmination of smaller year to year variances for temporary help  agents commissions  travel and entertainment expenses and miscellaneous fringe benefits 
losses from equity joint ventures  which includes results for the percent owned stepan philippines inc spi and percent owned tiorco  llc joint ventures  increased million from to spi s loss increased million  which reflected the effects of lower sales volume  unplanned production outages and foreign exchange losses 
tiorco  llc contributed million to the year to year increase in losses due to planned start up costs 

table of contents other  net expense increased million from to a million drop in investment related income partially offset by a million favorable swing in foreign exchange gains and losses  accounted for the expense change 
unrealized losses on the mutual fund investments held for the company s deferred compensation plans caused million of the decline in investment related income 
prior to the company s january   election of fair value accounting treatment for mutual fund investment assets  unrealized investment gains and losses were recorded directly to the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
lower capital gains distributions made by the mutual funds in than in accounted for the remainder of the investment income decline 
much of the favorable swing in foreign exchange gains and losses was attributable to the impact that a strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar had on a us dollar denominated receivable carried on stepan canada s books 
the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the rate for was unusually high due to the recording of a charge for uk goodwill impairment for which no tax benefit was realized

higher selling prices accounted for approximately 
table of contents million of the net sales growth 
a one percent decline in sales volume reduced the net sales growth by million 
the increase in average selling prices reflected price increases related primarily to rising material costs and a more favorable customer and product mix of sales 
a percent drop in biodiesel sales volume was the major contributor to the one percent decline in north american sales volume 
most other major product lines except laundry and cleaning products were also down between years 
sales volumes for laundry and cleaning products  north american operations largest product line  increased percent due to higher sales volume of fabric softener and new business 
the percent increase in net sales for european operations was attributable to a percent increase in average selling prices and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
sales volume declined four percent  reducing the growth of net sales by million 
selling price increases  related primarily to rising material costs  and a more favorable customer and product mix of sales caused the increase in average selling prices 
both the france and uk subsidiaries contributed to the decline in sales volume  which resulted from business lost due to price competition and to the slowdown in business for two large customers 
net sales for latin american operations increased percent due to a percent improvement in average selling prices  the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and a two percent rise in sales volume  which accounted for about million  million  and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
selling price increases related to higher raw material costs led to the improved average selling prices 
additional business for the company s brazil and colombia subsidiaries  partially offset by lower fabric softener sales volume for the company s mexico subsidiary  drove the sales volume gain 
surfactants operating income for was million  or percent  higher than operating income for operating income included a million gain on the sale of the company s specialty esters product line and a million charge for the impairment of stepan uk s goodwill

a more favorable customer and product mix also contributed to the gross profit improvement 

table of contents the regaining of profit margin and the improved sales mix more than offset the effect of the one percent decline in sales volume 
most of the profit improvement occurred in the first three quarters of fourth quarter gross profit fell million  or percent  from fourth quarter gross profit 
much of the quarter to quarter decrease was attributable to declining biodiesel profitability resulting from the consumption of high priced raw material inventories as falling crude oil and diesel prices drove biodiesel selling prices lower 
gross profit for european operations increased percent due to higher average selling prices and a million favorable impact of foreign currency translation that more than offset the effect of a four percent decline in sales volume 
selling price increases were made throughout to recoup some of the profit margin lost in previous years to persistent rising raw material costs 
a more favorable mix of sales contributed to the improved gross profit 
latin american operations gross profit increased percent as a result of gains at all three latin american subsidiaries 
lower outsourcing costs  higher selling prices and the two percent rise in sales volume led to the improved gross profit 
outsourcing costs were unusually high in the because stepan mexico purchased finished goods for resale while an expansion of its manufacturing facility and product approvals were being completed 
the favorable effects of foreign currency translation added approximately million to the region s total year to year gross profit growth 
operating expenses for the surfactants segment were up million  or percent  from to marketing and research and development expenses for north american operations accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the total operating expense increase 
the effects of foreign currency translation added million to the rise in operating expenses 
higher incentive based compensation  pension transition expense and salary expense accounted for most of the north american marketing and research and development expense increases 
higher bad debt expense and consulting fees also contributed to the rise in marketing expense 
in addition to the foregoing  million of the operating expense increase was attributable to the non recurring million gain on the sale of the specialty esters product line and the million goodwill impairment charge that were recorded in polymers polymer net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for higher selling prices and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million and million of the net sales improvement  respectively

a year to year comparison of net sales by region is displayed below 
table of contents for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase decrease percent change north america europe asia and other total polymers segment net sales for north american operations increased five percent as a result of a percent increase in average selling prices partially offset by a seven percent decline in sales volume 
the increase in selling prices accounted for approximately million of the net sales increase  while the decline in sales volume reduced the growth in net sales by million 
the higher average selling prices resulted from the recovery of higher raw material costs 
the sales volume decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of phthalic anhydride 
sales volume for phthalic anhydride dropped percent due largely to ongoing sluggishness in the unsaturated polyester resins market  which sells products to the automotive  recreational vehicles and boating industries 
sales volume for polyols  the largest polymer product line  increased six percent as demand from existing roofing insulation customers remained strong  particularly through the first three quarters of demand was down in the fourth quarter of due to the downturn in the overall economy and to delayed order patterns in anticipation of lower january prices 
sales volume of polyurethane systems products fell percent as a result of the july sale of the company s commodity system product lines 
net sales for european operations improved percent due to an percent increase in polyol sales volume  a five percent increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency translation  which accounted for million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
demand from the european insulation market was strong through the first three quarters of  due principally to higher energy costs and new insulation standards 
however  sales volume for the fourth quarter of dropped from that of the fourth quarter of as a result of the slowdown in the global economy 
the increase in average selling prices resulted from the recovery of higher raw material costs 
the percent improvement in net sales for asia and other regions was primarily attributable to a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
a three percent increase in average selling prices and a two percent increase in sales volume each contributed about million to the net sales increase 
polymer operating income for increased million  or percent  over operating income for operating income for included the million gain on the july sale of the commodity polyurethane systems product lines

table of contents for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase decrease percent change gross profit north america europe asia and other total polymers segment operating expenses operating income includes the million gain on the sale of the commodity polyurethane systems product lines 
the percent decline in gross profit for north american operations was attributable to a seven percent decrease in sales volume and higher raw material  maintenance and utility costs 
average raw material costs for all product lines were up approximately percent between and  which essentially eliminated the effect of higher selling prices 
maintenance costs increased approximately million  or percent  due primarily to work performed during a planned three week maintenance shutdown of the phthalic anhydride and polyol production facilities occurring in the fourth quarter of utility costs increased million due largely to increased rates for electricity and natural gas 
as noted previously  the slowdown in the economy began to affect polymer sales volumes in the fourth quarter of gross profit for european operations increased percent due to an percent increase in sales volume and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
higher raw material costs negatively impacted the gross profit result 
the region was successful in recovering higher raw material costs throughout the improvement in gross profit for asia and other regions resulted from higher sales prices and sales volume and a more profitable customer mix 
the million decrease in operating expenses was principally attributable to the million gain on the sale of the commodity polyurethane systems product lines  partially offset by a million increase in expenses for north american operations and a million increase in expenses for european operations 
the effects of foreign currency translation added an additional million of expense

in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
see the critical accounting policies section that follows for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities accounting policy

however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this form k and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company

critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 

table of contents deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and outside directors to defer receipt of their director fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company maintains sufficient shares of treasury stock to cover the equivalent number of shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares on the open market 
the plans allow for the deferred compensation to grow or decline based on the results of the investment options chosen by the participants 
some plan distributions may be made in cash or company common stock at the option of the participant 
certain plan distributions can only be made in company common stock 
upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive cash amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made or company common stock shares equal to the number of share equivalents held in their account 
for deferred compensation obligations that may be settled in cash  appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan results in additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds result in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
because the obligations that must be settled only in company common stock are treated as equity instruments  fluctuations in the market price of the underlying company stock do not affect earnings 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represented deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder was tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will generally fluctuate in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
on january   the company elected the fair value option provided by generally accepted accounting principles for the mutual fund investment assets related to its deferred compensation plans 
the fair value election for the mutual fund investment assets was made to reduce the income volatility caused by the previous accounting treatment for the company s deferred compensation plans 
specifically  beginning in  market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets are recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
in  value changes for the mutual fund investments were recorded as direct adjustments to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the accounting treatment for the portions of the deferred compensation liabilities that are tied to the company s common stock values was not affected by the fair value election 
dividends  capital gains distributed by the mutual funds  unrealized gains and losses 
table of contents and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss in the other  net line of the consolidated statements of income 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within a range of possible costs is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due to customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates globally  its cash flows and operating results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are recorded in earnings 
the company uses short term forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
at december   the company had one forward contract to sell million on behalf of its canadian subsidiary 
the company also had one contract to purchase million on behalf of its uk subsidiary 
finally  the company had contracts to buy million and million on behalf of its french and german subsidiaries  respectively 
periodically  the company and its subsidiaries issue us dollar and euro denominated trade receivables or loans to each other 
gains and losses on these transactions are included in income 
foreign currency exposures for the company s canadian and european subsidiaries are essentially all covered by forward contracts as noted above 
as of december   the company had net trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
hypothetical fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was made up of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on short term variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
the company s long term debt also includes a million unsecured bank term loan that carries a contractural interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the current market spread over libor for this type of loan would be approximately basis points 
as of december   the fair value of this term loan was approximately million less than the carrying value 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the market borrowing rate would increase the fair value of this loan by million 

table of contents commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are recovered from customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent the recovery of cost increases from customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of natural gas  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas would cause the company s actual natural gas cost to be million higher or lower than the market price 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase a minimum of  megawatt hours of electricity at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of electricity  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity would cause the company s actual electric cost to be million higher or lower than the market price
