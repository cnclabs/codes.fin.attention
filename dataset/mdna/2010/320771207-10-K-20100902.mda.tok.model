item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data included in item of this annual report and financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors included in item a of this annual report 
executive summary overview we offer outsourcing services to national and regional financial and educational institutions for designing and implementing private education loan programs 
these school certified loan programs are designed to be marketed through educational institutions or to prospective student borrowers and their families directly 
the private education loan portfolios generated by these loan programs may be held by the originating lender or financed in the capital markets 
in addition  we provide administrative and other services to securitization trusts that we facilitated  asset servicing to the third party owner of certain securitization trusts as well as portfolio management services 
we offer clients the opportunity to outsource key components of their private education loan programs to us by providing a fully integrated suite of services  including our monogram product offering 
we offer the following services on a stand alone  fee for service basis or as an integrated part of our monogram product offering loan origination we provide loan processing services to schools and lenders  from application intake through loan disbursement 
we are able to customize our services to meet the specific branding  pricing and underwriting requirements of our clients 
portfolio management we manage private education loan portfolios on behalf of their owners  including trusts facilitated by us  by employing risk analytics to monitor and manage the performance of the portfolio over time 
as part of this service offering  we monitor portfolio performance metrics  manage the performance of third party vendors and interface with rating 
table of contents agencies 
our infrastructure provides us with data that enables comprehensive analytics  and we are able to customize collections strategies as needed to optimize loan performance 
trust administration as administrator for securitization trusts that we facilitated  we perform various administrative functions  including preparation of financial statements  monitoring of the performance of loan servicers and third party collection agencies  including ensuring compliance with the servicing guidelines and various other transaction agreements and overseeing default prevention and collections activities 
we are responsible for reconciliation of funds among the third parties and the trusts  and we also provide regular reporting to investors in the abs issued by the trusts and other parties related to the trusts 
asset servicing our experience enables us to offer asset servicing such as residual analysis and valuation optimization services and strategies relating to asset funding to holders of a residual interest in private education loan securitizations 
our subsidiary  union federal  is a federally chartered thrift that offers residential and commercial mortgage loans and retail savings  money market and time deposit products 
prior to  union federal also offered private education loans directly to consumers  however  union federal did not originate private education loans during fiscal or fiscal  and as of september   we do not expect union federal to offer private education loans during fiscal we have begun exploring strategic alternatives for union federal  including a potential sale 
substantially all of our financial results have been derived from services provided with respect to private education loans  which we consider to be a single industry segment for financial reporting purposes 
our monogram product encompasses some or all of our service offerings and enables a lender to customize its loan program to meet its risk control and return objectives 
specifically  the lender can customize the range of loan terms offered to its qualified applicants  such as borrower repayment options  repayment terms and borrower pricing 
our monogram product is based on our proprietary origination risk score model  which uses borrower and cosigner attributes  as well as distribution channel variables  to assign a specific level of credit risk to the application at the time of initial credit decisioning 
a score is assigned to each application and governs the loan terms and features offered to applicants who pass the credit review 
for example  higher risk applicants may not be eligible to defer principal and interest while in school 
our online application also provides a qualified applicant with some ability to configure loan terms  showing the financial effects of the choices using a real time repayment calculator 
our monogram product can be structured so that lenders can hold the loans through the scheduled repayment  prepayment or default  or for some limited period of time before disposing of the loans in a capital markets transaction 
we believe that the loans generated through our monogram product will generally have shorter repayment periods and an increased percentage of borrowers making payments while in school  in each case when compared to loans generated under programs that we previously facilitated  and high cosigner participation rates 
the success of our monogram product will be a key driver of our future financial results and will be critical to growing and diversifying our revenues and client base 
development of our monogram product was completed in august  and the first loans based on our monogram product offering were disbursed during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the two initial monogram based loan programs  we agreed to provide credit enhancement to each of the lenders by funding a participation account  up to a specified dollar limit  to serve as a first loss reserve for defaulted program loans 
we will or have already provided an initial deposit into the participation accounts and have agreed to provide supplementary deposits into such accounts on a quarterly basis during the term of the loan program agreements based on disbursed loan volume and adjustments to default projections for program loans 
as consideration for the credit enhancement  we are entitled to receive a share of the interest 
table of contents generated on the loans 
as of september   we have funded capital commitments in the amount of million in support of suntrust bank s monogram based program 
historically  the driver of our results of operations and financial condition was the volume of private education loans for which we provided outsourcing services from loan origination through securitization 
in addition  asset backed securitizations were our sole source of permanent financing for our clients private education loan programs  and substantially all of our income was derived from securitizations 
securitization refers to the technique of pooling loans and selling them to a special purpose entity  typically a trust  which issues notes backed by those loans to investors 
in the past  we offered our clients a fully integrated suite of outsourcing services  but we did not charge separate fees for many of those services 
although we provided those various services without charging a separate fee  or at cost in the case of loan processing services  we generally entered into agreements with the lender clients giving us the exclusive right to securitize the private education loans that they did not intend to hold 
for our past securitization services  we are entitled to receive additional structural advisory fees from the trusts over time and  in the case of certain trusts  residual cash flows 
business trends and uncertainties we have not accessed the securitization market since september as a result of market disruptions that began in the second quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  persisted as of september  general economic conditions in the united states have deteriorated and not fully recovered over this time period 
our business has been and continues to be materially adversely impacted by these conditions 
credit performance of consumer related loans generally  as well as our private education loan portfolios and those held by the various securitization trusts that we facilitated  continued to be adversely affected by general economic conditions  including high unemployment rates 
the interest rate and economic and credit environments may continue to have a material negative effect on the estimated value of our service receivables and private education loans held for sale  which at june   primarily consisted of a portfolio of private education loans held by our subsidiary  ufsb spv  and pledged to a third party conduit lender pursuant to an education loan warehouse facility 
see note  liabilities and unused lines of credit education loan warehouse facility  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
our private education loan portfolios and those of the ncslt trusts have experienced higher levels of defaults and lower levels of repayments than we originally projected 
as a result  we significantly adjusted our projected performance assumptions associated with the ncslt trusts during fiscal and fiscal  including significant increases in our assumed default rates 
during fiscal  prepayment rates  however  remained at a rate that is extremely low by historical standards 
during fiscal  credit rating agencies took negative rating actions with respect to certain securitizations that we facilitated  citing ongoing performance deterioration  higher than expected levels of delinquencies and defaults  the expected reprioritization to senior noteholders of subordinate abs cash flows  declines in parity levels  reductions in available credit support for the transactions and interest trigger events that resulted in an interest shortfall to certain classes of notes 
these events have resulted in net reductions in the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residual receivables 
we recorded net losses of million during fiscal and million during fiscal as a result of trust updates to our additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables 
we also recorded losses of million during fiscal and million during fiscal in connection with fair value adjustments and realized losses on sales of portfolios of private education loans held for sale 

table of contents in addition  our lender clients previously had the opportunity to mitigate their credit risk through a loan repayment guaranty by teri  and we historically received reimbursement from teri for outsourced loan processing services we performed on teri s behalf 
in april  teri filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the teri reorganization  many clients elected to terminate some or all of their agreements with us  which resulted in a significant reduction in our facilitated loan volumes during fiscal and fiscal as compared to prior fiscal years 
the teri reorganization  together with capital markets dislocations  has had  and will likely continue to have  a material adverse effect on the securitization trusts ability to realize guaranty obligations of teri and our ability to realize fully the cost reimbursement obligations of teri 
as a result of economic conditions  we took several measures in fiscal and fiscal to adjust our business model we improved our liquidity position in august  when we received million in gross proceeds from an equity financing 
we greatly reduced our annual cash expenditure requirements through reductions in headcount  consolidation of office space and other cost saving initiatives that began in fiscal and continued through fiscal during fiscal  we made significant changes in our senior management team 
effective march   we sold the trust certificate 
the sale of the trust certificate combined with operating losses in fiscal resulted in refunds from tax authorities of million  received in october in addition  the purchaser of the trust certificate agreed to bear all future federal and state tax liabilities associated with the ncslt trust residuals  which would have had a material negative effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
we are no longer entitled to the residual cash flows of the ncslt trusts  although we continue to be entitled to receive residuals from other trusts 
during fiscal  we designed our monogram product  including the development and validation of our proprietary origination risk score model  product pricing  an enhanced application interface and additional disbursement and reporting capabilities 
we completed this development in august our monogram product was designed in part to provide us with fee based income as our services are provided  reducing our dependence on the securitization market in order to generate revenue 
we expect to earn monthly service fees  as well as a share of the portfolio income generated over the life of the loans 
in october  we sold approximately of the private education loan portfolio held by union federal as part of a risk reduction plan required by our supervisory agreement with the ots 
this sale resulted in gross proceeds of million 
in november  we sold the remainder of union federal s private education loan portfolio to one of our non bank subsidiaries 
in april  we restructured ufsb spv s education loan warehouse facility 
as part of the restructuring  ownership of ufsb spv was transferred from union federal to one of our non bank subsidiaries  fmd succeeded union federal as master servicer under the facility and fmd assumed certain potential contingent liabilities of union federal under the facility  subject to a cap 
we continue to examine alternatives with respect to union federal  including a potential sale  which we believe would provide further liquidity 
we believe that the termination by the ots of the order and supervisory agreement during the third quarter of fiscal and the elimination of union federal s ongoing duties and potential contingent liabilities related to ufsb spv s education loan warehouse facility will be viewed favorably by potential purchasers as we consider our strategic alternatives with respect to union federal 

table of contents we remain focused on preserving capital and maximizing liquidity in these challenging market conditions 
changes in any of the following factors could materially affect our financial results the level of market acceptance of our monogram product and our fee for service offerings  demand for private education financing  which may be affected by changes in limitations established by the federal government on the amount of federal loans that a student can receive  the terms and eligibility criteria for loans and grants under the federal government s programs and legislation recently passed or under consideration as of september   competition for providing private education financing and reluctance by lenders to participate in the private education loan market  conditions in the private education loan securitization market  including the costs or availability of financing  rating agency assumptions or actions  and market receptivity to private education loan asset backed securitizations  regulatory requirements applicable to union federal and us  general interest rate and consumer credit environments  including their effect on our assumed discount rate  net default and prepayment rates  the forward libor curve and the trusts ability to recover principal and interest from borrowers  our critical accounting policies and estimates  challenges relating to the federal income tax treatment of the sale of the trust certificate or our asset services agreement with the purchaser of the trust certificate  including proceedings related to any tax refund previously received  changes in gaap which could impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities  as well as require the consolidation or deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities  particularly following our consolidation of securitization trusts  and an associated net increase in total assets and liabilities of approximately billion and billion  respectively  effective july   as further discussed below  applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which lenders agree to make private education loans  recovery rates on defaulted private education loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  and developments in connection with the teri reorganization  including the consummation of the modified plan of reorganization proposed by teri and the creditors committee in august or the terms of a successor plan of reorganization 
we have made substantial progress in improving our financial condition and liquidity since the beginning of fiscal at june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
compensation and benefits expense during fiscal was million  and our product offering was dependent on securitization markets that we could not access and a bankrupt third party guarantor 
in addition  we were at the time confronting significant future tax liabilities on income from the ncslt trusts prior to our receipt of cash from these trusts  and had at june  private education loans held for sale with a principal and interest balance of million 
in contrast  we ended fiscal with million of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
compensation and benefits expense during fiscal was million  and our monogram product offering had been designed and successfully sold to two lender clients 
we believe that we have eliminated our future tax liabilities relating to income from the ncslt trusts  and we have reduced the outstanding principal and interest balance of private education loans held for sale to million at june  in addition  we successfully defended securities class action litigation and resolved formal enforcement actions initiated by the ots 

table of contents although we have limited experience with our monogram product  we believe that it will provide us with an opportunity to structure  process and originate private education loans and that our two recent loan program agreements are a significant step in our return to the private education lending marketplace 
we also believe that conditions in capital markets generally continued to improve during fiscal  potentially creating additional flexibility with regard to the financing of private education loans 
we continue to believe  as of september   however  that the structure and economics of any near term financing transaction would be less favorable than our past securitizations  with possibly lower revenues and additional cash requirements on our part 
during fiscal  we expect to continue to press for resolution of our claims against teri in the context of the teri reorganization  explore strategic alternatives for union federal  cultivate additional lender clients for our monogram product and seek innovative and efficient portfolio funding transactions 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  such as those involving recognition of service revenues and the valuation of our service receivables and portfolio of private education loans held for sale 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we expect to make changes to our critical accounting policies during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of our adoption of certain accounting pronouncements 
see consolidation below for additional information 
as of june   we determined that our estimates relating to the recognition and valuation of our securitization related revenues and receivables and asset servicing revenue and receivables  as described below  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
as of june   we also considered our policy with respect to the determination of whether or not to consolidate the financial results of the securitization trusts that we facilitate and the valuation of the portfolios of private education loans held for sale to be critical accounting policies 
service receivables and related revenue we have historically structured and facilitated securitization transactions for our clients through a series of special purpose statutory trusts 
through the securitization process  the trusts obtained private education loans from the originating lenders or their assignees  which relinquished to the trust their 
table of contents ownership interest in the loans 
the debt instruments that the trusts issued to finance the purchase of these private education loans are obligations of the trusts  rather than our obligations or those of originating lenders or their assignees 
we have recognized several types of fees in connection with our past securitization services additional structural advisory fees 
we are entitled to receive a structural advisory fee over the life of the trust  based on the amount of loans outstanding in the trust from time to time 
residuals 
we also have the right to receive a portion of the residual interests  if any  generated by various securitization trusts other than the ncslt trusts 
this right is junior in priority to the rights of the holders of the debt sold in the securitizations and additional structural advisory fees 
up front structural advisory fees 
we received a structural advisory fee at the time of our previous securitizations  based on the volume of loans securitized 
we are entitled to receive asset servicing fees from the owner of the trust certificate for services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
receipt of these fees is contingent upon distributions available to the owners of the residual interests of such trusts 
as required under gaap  we recognize the fair value of additional structural advisory fees and residuals as revenue at the time the securitization trust purchases the private education loans  as they are deemed to be earned at the time of the securitization but before we actually receive payment 
these amounts are deemed earned because evidence of an arrangement exists  we have provided the services  the fee is fixed and determinable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and there are no future contingencies or obligations due on our part 
on a quarterly basis  as required under gaap  we update our estimate of the fair value of these receivables as if they are investments in securities classified as trading  similar to retained interests in securitizations 
we recognize changes in fair value  less cash received  if any  as trust updates in servicing revenue in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we earn asset servicing fees as the services are performed  however  the receipt of the fees is contingent on distributions available to the owners of the residual interests of the trusts subject to these services 
we estimate the fair value of our asset servicing fee receivable based on income earned to date and the expected timing of the cash receipts of such income 
the net present value of fees earned for services performed during the period is recognized in revenue as fee income and changes in the estimated fair value of the receivable are recognized in revenue as fee updates 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees or residual receivables  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and the following key assumptions to estimate fair value expected annual rate and timing of loan defaults  including the effects of various risk mitigation strategies and temporarily modified payment plans for borrowers  expected amount and timing of recoveries of defaulted loans  discount rate  which we use to calculate the present value of our future cash flows  trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool  including the forward libor curve and expected auction rates  if applicable  annual rate and timing of private education loan prepayments  results of the teri reorganization and anticipated settlement of claims  and fees and expenses of the securitization trusts 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical data  certain macroeconomic indicators  publicly available third party data and our industry experience adjusted for specific product and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we monitor trends in loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our receivable balances and private education loans at each balance sheet date 
management s ability to determine which factors should be more heavily weighted in our estimates  and our ability to accurately incorporate those factors into our loan performance assumptions  can have a material effect on our valuations 
at june  and  additional structural advisory fee receivables were primarily due from the ncslt trusts 
at june  and  the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the debt issued by the ncslt trusts was billion and billion  respectively 
the principal underlying assets in the ncslt trusts were teri guaranteed private education loans with an aggregate outstanding principal and interest balance of billion  of which billion in outstanding principal and interest  or  were in deferment  million in outstanding principal and interest  or  were in forbearance and billion in outstanding principal and interest  or  were in repayment status as of june  in accordance with previously established servicer guidelines  certain borrowers have utilized a modified graduated payment program which permitted such borrowers to make payments that  for two years  were less than original contractual amounts due  then reset to require full repayment in accordance with original contractual interest rates and maturity dates 
during fiscal and fiscal  the average outstanding aggregate principal and interest balance of loans entering this program was of the average outstanding aggregate principal and interest balance of loans then in repayment 
outstanding principal and interest in the amount of billion  or  of the loans in repayment status as of june  were current  million in outstanding principal and interest  or  were between and days past due  million in outstanding principal and interest  or  were between and days past due  and million in outstanding principal and interest  or  were greater than days past due 
the payment status of borrowers  including borrowers making payments pursuant to a modified graduated payment program  is determined by contractual due dates 
as of june   the cumulative gross default rate with regard to loans in  and loans that have previously been in  repayment status in the ncslt trusts was 
we have posted to our website  www 
firstmarblehead 
com  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  static pool data as of june   including original pool characteristics and borrower payment status  delinquency  cumulative loss and prepayment data as of june  for certain securitization trusts that we facilitated 
we have also posted to our website  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  a supplemental presentation of certain historical trust performance data  including parity ratios by trust  net recovery rates by year of default  six month rolling prepayment rates  payment status by trust and payment status by risk segment 
default  recovery and prepayment rates 
default  recovery and prepayment rates are defined as follows default rates are the estimated cumulative principal balance of defaulted loans over the life of a trust divided by the original principal balance of the loans  recovery rates are the estimated net cumulative amount of recoveries reduced by costs of recovery on defaulted loans over the life of the trust  and prepayments are the difference between the total amount of payments  both principal and interest  received from or on behalf of a borrower and the amount of principal and interest billed to the borrower during the same period 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  our assumptions for default  recovery and prepayment rates relied primarily on historical data  updated in the short term for differences between projected results and actual results 
we evaluate our modeling methodologies on an ongoing basis  and during 
table of contents fiscal  we engaged an independent consulting firm to assist us in assessing our loss forecasting modeling methodology 
as a result of this assessment  we refined our models effective march  to include a prospective methodology that also applies macroeconomic factors in projecting future loan performance 
historical data was used to validate the enhanced methodology 
discount rates 
we apply discount rates to each of our financial instruments that we believe are commensurate with the tenure and risks involved 
in determining an appropriate discount rate for valuing our asset servicing fee and residual receivables  we consider a number of factors  including market data made available to us on spreads on federally guaranteed loans and private education loans  as well as rates used in the much broader abs market 
we also evaluate yield curves for corporate subordinated debt with maturities similar to the weighted average life of our residual interests 
until the third quarter of fiscal  the discount rate that we used to estimate fair value of our additional structural advisory fees was based on the year us treasury bond rate plus a risk premium 
in determining the risk premium  we considered factors such as yields on b rated instruments  the level of cash flows available to residual interests that support the additional structural advisory fees  as well as the weighted average life of the additional structural advisory fee receivables 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we refined our methodology for determining default and prepayment assumptions  which resulted in changes to projected cash flows 
these projected cash flows had the effect of lengthening the weighted average life of the additional structural advisory fee receivables  significantly reducing the amount of cash flows available to the residual interests that support the cash flows available for additional structural advisory fees and delaying the timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees 
the combination of all these factors led us to determine that additional structural advisory fee receivables are more analogous to longer term financial instruments than year debt instruments 
the discount rate used for additional structural advisory fees reflects market data made available to us on spreads on federally guaranteed loans and private education loans  as well as rates used in the much broader abs market and is less than the used for residual receivables  reflecting the seniority of the additional structural advisory fees in the cash flow waterfall of the securitization trusts 
auction rate note interest rates 
five of the ncslt trusts issued auction rate notes to finance  in whole or in part  the purchase of private education loans 
failed auctions occurred and have persisted as of september  with respect to these five trusts 
the failed auctions  deterioration in trust performance and the downgrade in insurance financial strength ratings assigned to the credit enhancement provider for certain auction rate notes  have resulted in the auction rate notes bearing interest at a maximum spread over one month libor as specified in the indentures  based on the ratings assigned to the notes as of september  we assume that all auction rate notes will continue to bear interest at their current maximum spreads until their expected maturity dates 
forward libor curve 
the forward libor curve is a market observable input obtained from an independent third party 
libor is the underlying rate for most of the trusts assets and liabilities  and fluctuations in libor can have a significant effect on the cash flows generated by each trust 
changes in the forward libor curve affect the principal balances of private education loans held by the trusts  particularly as interest is capitalized during loan deferment  which affects the net interest margin that the trust generates 
in addition  certain trusts have issued a tranche of abs that bears a fixed interest rate 
a decrease in the forward libor curve has resulted in the past in a reduced spread on the fixed interest tranche  which has in the past decreased the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
significant changes to the forward libor curve can also affect the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees accumulated  the majority of which bear interest at the rate of libor plus a spread to the extent such fees are accrued but unpaid by the trusts 
teri s obligation to pay claims 
during fiscal  we adjusted the estimated fair value of our service receivables to reflect our assumption that teri would not be able to honor its obligations to the ncslt trusts beyond the amounts available in pledged accounts  assuming all recoveries on 
table of contents defaulted loans would be used to replenish such pledged accounts 
during fiscal  we updated our assumptions to reflect the terms of the plan of reorganization  as follows with limited exceptions  each ncslt trust will receive from teri the balance  if any  remaining in its respective pledged account  certain defaulted loans transferred by the ncslt trusts to teri prior to the teri reorganization will be assigned to the respective ncslt trust  and  with limited exceptions  all recoveries on such loans will benefit the respective ncslt trust  defaulted loans transferred by the ncslt trusts to teri subsequent to the teri reorganization using funds from a pledged account will not be assigned to the respective ncslt trust  but rather will be assigned to a liquidating trust 
recoveries on such loans will benefit unsecured creditors of teri pro rata  including the ncslt trusts  and will not replenish the pledged account of the respective ncslt trust  and each ncslt trust will receive a pro rata distribution of defaulted loan recoveries available to the general unsecured creditors of teri based on each trust s unsecured claim 
no other amounts have been assumed to benefit the trusts for their claims as general unsecured creditors 
the modified plan of reorganization  which was filed in august  changes certain aspects of the settlements offered to the ncslt trusts compared to the settlements offered by the plan of reorganization 
as of september   we did not expect those changes to have a material effect on the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
as of september   the voting and confirmation process for the modified plan of reorganization had not commenced  and the terms of the modified plan of reorganization remain subject to change 
see note  commitments and contingencies teri reorganization  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional details 
sensitivity analysis increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of libor  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees  as well as our asset servicing fee receivables and our private education loans held for sale 
information about the actual performance of the ncslt trusts is included above under application of critical accounting policies and estimates service receivables and related revenue and as exhibit to this annual report 
you should consider that actual trust performance data in assessing our projected performance assumptions at june  the following table illustrates the anticipated impact on the fair value of additional structural advisory fee receivables that would occur for changes in loan performance and discount rate assumptions at june  we used variations of and  up and down  except for the forward libor rates  which are based on variations of and  from the assumptions used at june  we also assumed that the plan of reorganization  including terms applicable to the ncslt trusts  would be confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
changes to the plan of reorganization  such that the nclst trusts were to receive less defaulted loans or less recoveries on defaulted loans  would have an additional negative effect on the value of our receivables 

table of contents the sensitivities presented below are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the effect of each change in assumption must be calculated independently  holding all other assumptions constant 
because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent  the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in key assumptions may differ materially from the sum of the individual effects calculated below

education loans held for sale 
private education loans held for sale by ufsb spv have been pledged to an education loan warehouse facility provided by a third party lender 
the loans are subject to call provisions by the 
table of contents third party lender  and  therefore  we do not have the ability to hold the loans to maturity 
private education loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of private education loans held for sale is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
when available  the fair value is based on quoted market values 
in the absence of readily determined market values  fair value is estimated by management based on the present value of expected future cash flows from the private education loans held for sale 
these estimates are based on historical and third party data  macroeconomic indicators and our industry experience with the assumptions for  among other things  default rates  recovery rates on defaulted loans  prepayment rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
if readily determined market values became available  or if actual performance were to vary appreciably from management s estimates  the fair value of the loans would need to be further adjusted  which could result in material differences from the recorded carrying amounts 
changes in the carrying value of private education loans held for sale are recorded as a separate component of non interest expense 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of fmd and its subsidiaries  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions 
we have not consolidated the financial results of the securitization trusts purchasing loans that we have facilitated 
at june  and  each of the securitization trusts created after january   has met the criteria to be a qspe  as defined by asc accordingly  we did not consolidate these existing securitization trusts in our financial statements 
in addition  the securitization trusts created prior to january  in which we hold a variable interest that could result in our being considered the primary beneficiary of such trusts have been amended in order for them to be considered qspes 
effective july   we adopted asu  transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets  or asu  and asu prior to their codification  asu was referred to as financial accounting standard  accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement  and asu was referred to as financials accounting standard  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
asu removes the concept of a qspe from asc and removes the exemption from consolidation for qspes from asc  consolidation  or asc asu updates asc to require that certain types of enterprises perform analyses to determine if they are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
in addition  asu requires us to continuously reassess whether consolidation of variable interest entities is appropriate  as opposed to the trigger based assessment allowed under previous guidance 
as a result  we may be required to consolidate or deconsolidate variable interest entities on a quarterly basis  which may lead to volatility in our financial results and make comparisons of results between time periods more challenging 
effective july   we consolidated securitization trusts that we previously facilitated and deconsolidated ufsb spv 
assets and liabilities of the entities consolidated were measured as if they had been consolidated at the time we became the primary beneficiary 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated 
profits and losses of the consolidated variable interest entities are allocated to non controlling interests based on the percentage ownership of voting interests  before the effect of

asu has been applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the effective date 
at the effective date of consolidation  we recorded a net increase in total assets and total liabilities of approximately billion and billion  respectively  and a net decrease in total stockholders equity of approximately million comprised of an increase in fmd stockholders equity of approximately million recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings more than offset by a non controlling interest deficit of approximately million 
included in these amounts were the following adjustments consolidation of approximately billion of held to maturity securitized loan receivables  at amortized cost  consolidation of approximately billion of non recourse debt issued by the trusts to third party investors  reversal of additional structural advisory fee and residual interest receivables totaling million  previously recorded as due from the asset securitization trusts consolidated  and deconsolidation of ufsb spv with assets of million and liabilities of million  and reversal of million in deferred tax assets associated with the unrealized losses of ufsb spv on private education loans held for sale 
after adoption of asu and asu  our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization related income  trust updates or administrative fees from the securitization trusts 
instead  we will recognize interest income associated with securitized loan receivables in the same line item as interest income from non securitized assets  as well as a provision for loan losses  and we will recognize interest expense associated with debt issued by the trusts to third party investors on the same line item as other interest bearing liabilities of fmd 
on a consolidated basis  we will not record any revaluation gains or losses related to the additional structural advisory fee and residual interest receivables due from the securitization trusts  but we continue to recognize revaluation gains and losses on receivables from securitization trusts that were not consolidated 
the effect of the consolidation will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of fiscal ending september  adoption of asu and asu will also have the effect of requiring us to re evaluate which accounting policies should be considered critical accounting polices 
as a result of adoption of these accounting pronouncements  we believe that our critical accounting policies will include policies related to determination of an allowance for loan losses and related provisions  include policies related to recognition and presentation of loans and the related interest income  continue to include our consolidation policy  although it will be significantly different  not include service receivables and related revenue because they will almost entirely be eliminated upon consolidation of the trusts  and not include valuation of private education loans held for sale because all private education loans held for sale are owned by ufsb spv  which was deconsolidated upon adoption

we reported a net loss of million  or per share  on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal total revenues decreased million  primarily as a result of write downs of our service receivables in fiscal due to market conditions and the sale of the trust certificate  a million decrease in up front structural advisory fees in fiscal  and a million decrease in processing fees from teri due to the teri reorganization 
partially offsetting the decrease in revenue  total non interest expenses decreased million over the same period 
the cessation of services for teri and marketing support services for other clients  combined with reductions in headcount and other cost savings initiatives  reduced combined compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses by million during fiscal however  losses to adjust the carrying value of our private education loan portfolio held for sale to fair value increased by million from fiscal to fiscal

additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables represent the estimated fair value of service receivables expected to be collected over the life of the various separate securitization trusts that have purchased private education loans facilitated by us  with no further service obligation on our part 
asset servicing fee receivables represent the estimated fair value of service receivables earned as of the balance sheet date 
additional structural advisory fees we are entitled to receive additional structural advisory fees over time  based on payment priorities established in the trusts indentures 
in general  the amounts due to us from the trusts accumulate monthly from the date of a securitization at a rate of to of loan principal outstanding per year plus accrued interest on earned but unpaid fee income 
we generally become entitled to receive this fee  plus interest  once the ratio of trust assets to trust liabilities in the particular trust  which we refer to as the parity ratio  reaches a stipulated level  which ranges from to 
the level applicable to a particular trust is determined at the time of securitization  however  the occurrence of trigger events defined below can impact the payment priorities 
actual parity ratios at june  for the ncslt trusts ranged from to 
please refer to exhibit to this annual report for additional information on actual trust parity ratios for the ncslt trusts as of june  the stipulated parity ratio levels may be raised if certain trust characteristics change 

table of contents at the time of securitization  we recorded additional structural advisory fees at net present value  or estimated fair value  on the balance sheet as additional structural advisory fee receivables and in the statement of operations as additional structural advisory fees new securitizations 
on a quarterly basis  we update our estimate of the fair value of our structural advisory fee receivables and recognize the change in fair value  less cash received  if any  in the statement of operations as additional structural advisory fees trust updates 
to estimate fair value  we apply a discount rate commensurate with the risk applicable to the projected cash flows of the trusts 
projected cash flows are developed using trust performance assumptions including expected operational expenses  expected rate and timing of loan defaults and recoveries on defaulted loans  the rate and timing of prepayments  the trend of contractual and market interest rates over the life of the loan pool  the cost of funding outstanding auction rate notes  assumptions relating to the teri reorganization and the existence of certain circumstances  which we refer to as trigger events  upon the occurrence of which payments that would otherwise be due with respect to additional structural advisory fees and residuals would instead be directed to the holders of the notes issued by the trusts until the condition causing the trigger event ceases to exist or all notes and related interest are paid in full 
these assumptions are based on historical and third party data  macroeconomic indicators and our industry experience 
as of june   we estimate that we will receive fees approximately five to years after the date of a particular securitization transaction 
however  for many of the ncslt trusts  the bankruptcy filing of their loans primary guarantor  teri  or cumulative gross default rates have resulted in trigger events 
these events may significantly delay the receipt of fees 
the following table summarizes changes in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands fair value at beginning of period additions from new securitizations cash received from trust distributions trust updates passage of time fair value accretion increase in timing and average default rate decrease increase in average prepayment rate increase in discount rate assumptions decrease in forward libor curve increase in auction rate notes spread decrease in recovery assumption other factors  net net change from trust updates fair value at end of period during fiscal  we refined our methodology to include prospective macroeconomic factors in projecting future loan performance 
using this refined model  we increased the expected default rate assumptions and decreased the expected prepayment rate assumptions used in our cash flow models 
we also increased the discount rate as a result of the reduction in cash flows available to residual interests that support the additional structural advisory fees combined with the lengthening of the weighted average life of the receivables 
the combination of changes in our assumptions and a decrease in the forward libor curve resulted in a reduction in the carrying value recorded as trust updates of million for fiscal 
table of contents for fiscal  we recorded losses for additional structural advisory fees trust updates of million  compared to losses from trust updates of million for fiscal  reflecting increases in the assumed discount rate  net default rates and auction rate note spreads  as well as a decrease in the forward libor curve 
fiscal service revenue also included additional structural advisory fees new securitizations of million of revenue attributable to new securitizations  with no comparable amount recorded in fiscal or fiscal for a detailed discussion of the underlying assumptions used to determine the amounts reported above  see the section private education loan performance assumptions below 
residuals as we facilitated the securitizations of loan pools  we were entitled to receive a portion of the residual cash flows  if any  generated by the various securitization trusts that purchased the loans 
at the time of securitization  we recorded the estimated fair value of these residual cash flows on our balance sheet as residual receivables and in the statement of operations as residuals new securitizations 
on a quarterly basis  we update our estimate of the fair value of residual receivables and recognize the change in fair value less cash received in the statement of operations as residuals trust updates 
as a result of the sale of the trust certificate  effective march   we are no longer entitled to the residual cash flows of the ncslt trusts  although we continue to be entitled to receive residuals from other trusts 
the sale of the trust certificate resulted in a reduction in the carrying value of residual receivables in fiscal of million and reduced our exposure to changes in fair value during fiscal the following table summarizes the changes in the estimated fair value of our residual receivables fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands fair value at beginning of period additions from new securitizations trust updates passage of time fair value accretion decrease increase in discount rate assumptions increase in timing and average default rate increase decrease in forward libor curve increase in auction rate notes spread decrease increase in average prepayment rate decrease to reflect disposition teri s inability to pay claims increase in trust expenses other factors  net net change from trust updates fair value at end of period residuals trust updates in fiscal of million related only to the trusts that were not part of the sale of the trust certificate 
the net increase primarily reflected accretion for the passage of time and a decrease in the discount rate 

table of contents for fiscal  residuals trust updates was a net loss of million 
the loss  in part  reflected valuation adjustments primarily related to higher default and discount rate assumptions  higher interest rates on auction rate notes and a decrease in the forward libor curve  partially offset by accretion for the passage of time and lower assumed prepayment rates 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million to reflect a reduction in carrying value due to the sale of the trust certificate  as described below 
on march   nc residuals owners trust was formed by the statutory conversion of our wholly owned subsidiary  gate holdings  inc as a result of the conversion  we became the sole legal and beneficial owner of the trust certificate 
nc residuals owners trust  together with its wholly owned subsidiary  owned certain certificates of beneficial ownership interests  or residuals  of the ncslt trusts 
the ncslt trusts are the holders of substantially all teri guaranteed loans facilitated by us 
effective march   we entered into  among other agreements  a purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement  with vcg owners trust  a newly formed statutory trust  which we refer to as the purchaser  and vcg securities  llc  which we refer to as vanquish investor 
the purchaser and vanquish investor are affiliates of vanquish capital management llc 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we transferred the trust certificate to the purchaser effective as of march   and we recorded the decrease in the carrying value of our residual receivables of million 
as a result  the purchaser became the indirect owner of the residuals that were formerly owned by us indirectly through nc residuals owners trust 
in consideration for the sale  the purchaser and vanquish investor agreed to bear all future federal and state tax liabilities associated with the residuals 
residuals trust updates for fiscal was a net loss of million  as a result of a million adjustment to reflect the teri reorganization and teri s inability to pay future claims beyond the balance in the pledged accounts  combined with million of losses primarily related to increases in discount and default rate assumptions and higher interest rates on auction rate notes 
residuals new securitizations for fiscal reflected two trusts facilitated during the first quarter of that year 
we have been unable to access the securitization market since that time 
to estimate fair value  we apply a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved to the projected cash flows of the trusts 
the projected cash flows of the trusts are the same projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables 
for a detailed discussion of the underlying assumptions used to determine the amounts reported above  see private education loan performance assumptions below 
asset servicing fees in connection with the sale of the trust certificate discussed above  we entered into an asset services agreement and a data sharing and license agreement with the purchaser effective march  pursuant to the asset services agreement  we have agreed to provide certain asset servicing to the purchaser to support the purchaser s ownership of the residuals  including  among others  analysis and valuation optimization services and services relating to funding strategy 
as compensation for services  we are entitled to an asset servicing fee  calculated as a percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of loans outstanding in the trusts 
although this fee is earned monthly  our right to receive the fee is contingent on distributions made to the holders of the residuals 
distributions made by each of the ncslt trusts will be allocated as follows commencing with the first calendar month in which residual cash flows are paid  and for each payment date during the next calendar months from that date  we will receive of the purchaser s residual cash flows  
table of contents for each payment date after that  we will receive of the purchaser s residual cash flows until all earned but unpaid asset servicing fees are paid in full  and thereafter  once all earned but unpaid fees have been received  we will receive our monthly fee  paid in full 
we will not receive any asset servicing fees until the purchaser has begun to receive residual cash flows 
during fiscal  our asset servicing fees earned reflected a full year of earnings  while the asset services agreement was only in effect for one fiscal quarter in fiscal fee updates for fiscal were a loss of million  reflecting changes in the volume and timing of projected cash flows available to the holders of the residuals for the payment of such fees 
see private education loan performance assumptions below for changes in performance assumptions 
fee updates in fiscal reflected accretion for the passage of time 
private education loan performance assumptions during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed initial enhancements to the financial models that we use to estimate the fair value of our service receivables 
the enhancements provide for the inclusion of certain prospective macroeconomic factors in our performance assumptions for those private education loans securitized in the ncslt trusts 
as our risk models continue to evolve  we anticipate additional future enhancements 
risk segments 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we retroactively scored loans in the ncslt trusts using our proprietary risk score modeling  loan origination data as well as additional credit bureau data made available following origination 
we then divided loans into three risk segments  with loans in segment expected to perform better than loans in segment and loans in segment expected to perform better than loans in segment the table below identifies performance assumptions for each segment  as well as the percentage of the ncslt trust portfolios in each segment 
june  ncslt portfolio segment segment segment distribution by original loan amount distribution by total outstanding loan amount not in repayment in repayment total by segment gross default rate recovery rate net default rate prepayment rate outstanding aggregate principal and capitalized interest balance as of june  loans not in repayment include loans in deferment or forbearance status as of june  using projected defaults  net defaults and recoveries over the lives of the trusts as a percentage of original outstanding aggregate principal and accrued interest balance 

table of contents amount presented is the weighted average conditional prepayment rate  or cpr  over the lives of the trusts 
the cpr is an estimate of the likelihood that a loan will be prepaid during a period given that it has not previously defaulted or been repaid in full 
the table below identifies our overall assumptions as of june  and june  year over year change gross default rate net default rate recovery rate prepayment rate year end discount rate assumptions for fiscal  and were as follows year over year change june  additional structural advisory fee receivables asset servicing fee and residual receivables default and recovery rates 
during fiscal  we reduced the carrying value of additional structural advisory fee receivables by million as a result of higher assumed default rates  with no change to recovery rates 
the change in our default assumptions had the effect of delaying the projected timing of our receipt and amount of cash flows available for asset servicing fees 
as a result  we decreased asset servicing fee receivables by million for fiscal our residual receivables  which decreased by thousand during fiscal  were less affected by the change in default rates  in light of our sale of the trust certificate in fiscal during fiscal  we increased our gross default rate assumption from to  reflecting general economic conditions and actual loss experience of the trusts 
in addition  we reduced our assumed recovery rate from to  and we lengthened the projected recovery timetable we used from nine to years as a result of a refinement to the methodology for determining the endpoint default rate  as well as the actual timing of recoveries 
the higher gross default rates resulted in decreases in the estimated fair values of our additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables of million and million  respectively  during fiscal the change in rate and timing of recoveries reduced the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees by million  but did not have a material impact on residual receivables because the change was made in the fourth quarter  subsequent to the sale of the trust certificate 
during fiscal  the higher projected gross default rate resulted from weakening general economic conditions 
the gross default rate increased by during fiscal to  reducing the fair value of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables by million and million  respectively 
the increase in the recovery rate from to did not have a material impact 
prepayment rates 
in general  prepayment rates have been in decline since march our financial model enhancements incorporate certain prospective macroeconomic factors in determining prepayment assumptions 
as a result of those macroeconomic factors  including the interest rate environment and economic conditions  such as unemployment rates  prepayments are expected to be lower and slower than previously projected  and therefore  we increased the value of our structural advisory fee receivables by million during fiscal changes to prepayment rates did not significantly affect the fair value of our residual or asset servicing fee receivables 

table of contents during fiscal  in response to a historically low prepayment rate  we decreased our assumed prepayment rate by  which resulted in an increase to additional structural advisory fee receivables of million and an increase to the residual receivables of million prior to the sale of the trust certificate 
during fiscal  prepayment rates increased by due to higher prepayment activity experienced by the trusts during that period 
as result  we recorded decreases in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables of million and million  respectively 
discount rate additional structural advisory fees 
until the third quarter of fiscal  the discount rate that we used to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees was based on the year us treasury bond rate plus a risk premium 
in determining the risk premium  we considered factors such as yields on b rated instruments  the level of available cash flows from residual interests that support the additional structural advisory fees  as well as the weighted average life of the additional structural advisory fee receivables 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we utilized a discount rate of in determining the fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables 
the change from an index based discount rate to a rate of reflects a reduction in the amount of residual interest cash flows available to support the cash flows available for additional structural advisory fees  as well as the lengthening of the weighted average life of the additional structural advisory fee receivables 
the combination of these factors led us to determine that additional structural advisory fee receivables are more analogous to longer term financial instruments than year debt instruments  and therefore  a higher discount rate is appropriate 
the discount rate used for the additional structural advisory fees reflects market data made available to us on spreads on federally guaranteed loans and private education loans  as well as rates used in the much broader abs market and is less than the used for residual receivables  reflecting the seniority of the additional structural advisory fees in our cash flow waterfall of the securitization trusts 
the increase in the discount rate resulted in a million decrease in the value of additional structural advisory fee receivables for fiscal during fiscal  we increased the discount rate spread over the year us treasury bond rate by  to 
in increasing the discount rate  we considered  among other things  overall significant widening in spreads in the abs marketplace  as well as increases in indicative spreads on subordinate private education loan securities 
the year us treasury bond rate decreased by during the same period  to at june  as a result  we applied a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value 
the increase in the discount rate during fiscal resulted in a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees 
during fiscal  we increased the discount rate spread over the year us treasury bond rate from to 
the year us treasury note rate decreased by during the same period resulting in a discount rate of  up from june   in response to the deterioration in the market for structured and corporate debt 
the effect of the increase to the discount rate was a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fee receivables during fiscal discount rate asset servicing fees and residuals 
in determining an appropriate discount rate for purposes of estimating the fair value of our asset servicing fee and residual receivables  we consider a number of factors  including market data made available to us on spreads on federally guaranteed loans and private education loans  as well as rates used in the much broader abs market 
we also evaluate yield curves for corporate subordinated debt with maturities similar to the weighted average life of our residuals 

table of contents we applied a discount rate of during fiscal  which was a decrease of  from  at the prior year end 
as a result  there was an increase in residual receivables of million during fiscal due to changes in the discount rate and no material change to our asset servicing fee receivable 
during fiscal  we increased the discount rate from to  which resulted in decreases in the estimated fair value of our residual receivables of million 
the increase over the prior fiscal year was in response to the deterioration of the abs market and revised assumptions about teri s ability to pay claims 
during fiscal  we increased the discount rate used for estimating for residual receivables by to in response to deteriorating market conditions 
the higher discount rate resulted in a reduction to the estimated fair value of residual receivables of million 
forward libor curve 
fluctuations in interest rates  specifically libor  which is the underlying rate for most of the trusts assets and liabilities  can have a significant impact on the cash flows generated by each trust 
the forward libor curve is a market observable input obtained from an independent third party 
changes in the forward libor curve can have a significant impact on the principal balances of the private education loans especially early in a loan s life when interest is capitalizing on loans in deferment  which affects the overall net interest margin the trust can generate  and can impact our additional structural advisory fee receivables as the majority of accrued but unpaid fees bear interest at libor plus 
in addition  certain trusts have issued a tranche of abs that bears a fixed interest rate 
a decrease in the forward libor curve may result in a reduced spread on the fixed interest rate tranche  which  in turn  decreases the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
for the fiscal year ended june   the forward libor curve shifted downward from the prior year end  reducing the value of the additional structural advisory fee receivables by million  with no material impact to residual receivables 
during fiscal  large decreases in the forward libor curve resulted in decreases in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables of million and million  respectively 
similarly  during fiscal  decreases in the forward libor curve resulted in decreases in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables of million and million  respectively 
auction rate note interest rates 
prior to fiscal  we facilitated five trusts that issued auction rate notes to finance  in whole or in part  the purchase of private education loans 
interest rates for the auction rate notes are determined from time to time at auction  however  during fiscal and fiscal  failed auctions occurred or persisted with respect to auction rate notes issued by each of the five trusts 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the ratings assigned to the auction rate notes of these trusts were downgraded due to failed auctions  deterioration in trust performance and the downgrade of the insurance financial strength rating assigned to the credit enhancement provider for certain auction rate notes 
as a result  the auction rate notes bear interest at a maximum spread over one month libor as specified in the indentures  based on the ratings then assigned to the notes 
increases in the interest expense of the trusts reduced the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees and residual receivables and delayed the timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  we decreased the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables by million and our residual receivables by million 
we did not make any further adjustments during fiscal during fiscal  we assumed that the notes would continue to bear interest at the contractual maximum spread 
teri s obligation to pay claims 
during fiscal  we reduced the carrying value of our residual receivables in response to the teri reorganization and our assumption that teri would not be able 
table of contents to honor its guaranty obligations to the ncslt trusts beyond the amounts available in the pledged accounts  assuming that all recoveries on defaulted loans would be used to replenish such pledged accounts 
the change in our assumptions with regard to teri s ability to pay claims resulted in a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of our residual receivables during fiscal no changes were made to our assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay claims during fiscal during fiscal  we updated our assumptions regarding teri s obligation to pay claims based on the plan of reorganization presented for creditor approval in april the updated assumptions did not have a material effect on the estimated value of our additional structural advisory fee or asset servicing fee receivables 
the modified plan of reorganization  which was filed in august  changes certain aspects of the settlements offered to the ncslt trusts compared to the settlements offered by the plan of reorganization 
as of september   we did not expect those changes to have a material effect on the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
as of september   the voting and confirmation process for the modified plan of reorganization had not commenced and the modified plan of reorganization remains subject to change 
administrative and other fees during fiscal  administrative and other fees were million  down million from fiscal fees in fiscal primarily consisted of compensation for loan portfolio default prevention and trust administration services provided to the trusts that we facilitated 
fees from these services increased by a net million over fiscal  however  the increase was more than offset by declines in marketing related cost reimbursement and teri processing fees 
prior to the teri reorganization  we provided outsourcing services for teri  including loan origination  customer service  default processing  default prevention and administrative services  at cost  under a master servicing agreement 
we recognized teri s reimbursement of our expenses for these services as revenue 
in june  in the context of the teri reorganization  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement effective may   but provided for a transition services agreement between teri and us with a term through september  as a result  our reimbursement from teri for fiscal was million  down from million in fiscal we do not expect to receive a material amount of processing fees from teri in the future 
prior to the teri reorganization  we received marketing related cost reimbursement upon disbursement of loans to borrowers 
we generally ceased processing loan applications for teri guaranteed loan programs at the time the teri reorganization began 
up front structural advisory fees historically  we received up front structural advisory fees at the time a securitization trust purchased loans as compensation for structuring debt securities sold in the securitization  coordination of the attorneys  accountants  trustees  loan servicers  loan originators and other transaction participants and preparation of cash flow modeling for rating agencies  as needed 
we did not record any up front structural advisory fees in fiscal or fiscal because we did not facilitate any securitizations during these periods 
we recorded million in up front structural advisory fees in fiscal related to two securitizations of teri guaranteed loans that we facilitated during the first quarter of fiscal net interest income net interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income from private education loans held for sale decreased by million in fiscal as a result of the sale of approximately of union federal s portfolio in october  and lower rates on loans  cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense decreased million  largely as a result of lower deposit volumes and rates paid on deposits and lower volumes of borrowings  partially offset by a higher rate of interest paid on the education loan warehouse facility 

table of contents during fiscal  net interest income was relatively flat compared to fiscal overall  volumes of interest bearing assets and liabilities were higher  but rates earned and paid declined during the year 
the source of interest income shifted from cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold to private education loans held for sale  when compared with fiscal  largely because the portfolios generated by union federal and held by union federal and ufsb spv during fiscal were outstanding for the full year in fiscal the sources of interest expense shifted from time and savings accounts to money market accounts and the education loan warehouse facility  with the borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility outstanding for a full year in fiscal versus a partial year in fiscal the following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities consolidated average balance sheet  interest and rates taxable equivalent rates fiscal years ended june  average daily balance interest rate average daily balance interest rate average daily balance interest rate dollars in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents federal funds sold short term investments investments held for sale education loans held for sale loans held to maturity total interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents mark to market reserves other assets total assets liabilities time and savings deposits money market deposits education loan warehouse facility other short term borrowings other interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits all other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest earning assets net interest income net interest margin in fiscal and fiscal  we invested in certain cash equivalents and investments securities that are tax exempt

table of contents compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase relates to the higher cost of stock based compensation for restricted stock units granted during the year  largely offset by the lower cost of benefits and lower severance costs 
during fiscal  compensation and benefits expense decreased by million primarily due to a net decrease of headcount of employees during fiscal and fiscal  including departures of former executive management 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million  in part  reflecting continued cost cutting and efficiency efforts 
expenses decreased across every category  except occupancy expense which reflected a charge related to unoccupied space in the amount of million taken in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the retirement of certain fixed assets 
lower third party service costs reflect the reduced use of consultants and outside counsel as outstanding litigation was resolved and we recouped million in legal fees from insurance providers 
other expenses were down due to lower goodwill write downs and lower liquidity fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to the termination by clients of their marketing related agreements  largely as a result of the teri reorganization 
the overall decrease in loan volumes reduced the need for and expenses related to external call centers  professional and consulting services and other costs for loan origination and liquidity and guaranty fees included in other expenses 
in addition  the reduced headcount in fiscal resulted in lower occupancy and equipment costs 
losses on private education loans held for sale we recorded losses on private education loans held for sale of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold private education loans held for sale by union federal to an unaffiliated third party for proceeds of million 
such loans comprised approximately of union federal s portfolio of private education loans directly held by it for sale  excluding loans held by ufsb spv 
we recorded unrealized losses during the first quarter of fiscal of million on all private education loans held for sale based on the bid we received from the third party for the loans 
in addition to the sale  we recorded additional net unrealized losses of million during fiscal our estimates of fair value of the private education loans held for sale at june   are based on our cash flow model  which reflects increases in assumptions for default rates and lower recovery rates  similar to the deterioration in performance experienced by the securitization trusts we facilitated 
during fiscal  we recorded losses on private education loans of million  reflecting increases in assumptions related to the discount and default rates  and a decrease in the assumption for recoveries 
the net default rate used for our own private education loan portfolios is higher than that of the ncslt trusts based on trust performance and borrower characteristics 
income tax benefit our income tax benefit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the lower overall benefit in fiscal was a result of lower pre tax losses during fiscal during fiscal  our effective tax rate  or the income tax benefit as a percentage of pre tax loss  decreased to from an effective tax rate of for fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal 
table of contents reflects our inability to utilize state net operating losses  particularly in massachusetts  which does not provide for any carryback or carryforward of such losses  as well as certain non deductible compensation costs 
as a result of the sale of the trust certificate  effective march   as well as our operating losses for fiscal  we recorded income tax receivables during fiscal for federal and state income taxes paid on prior taxable income 
during fiscal  we received a total of million in federal and state income tax refunds related to our income tax receivables 
during april  the irs commenced an audit of our tax returns for fiscal years  and we cannot predict the timing or outcome of the audit at this time 
in november  the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of  or whbaa  was signed into law 
pursuant to the whbaa  we are allowed to carry back the taxable losses from either fiscal or fiscal for five years  instead of two years 
we have estimated that taxable income in previous years will be sufficient to cover the taxable losses of both fiscal and fiscal regardless of which fiscal year is carried back 
as a result of the whbaa and pre existing net operating loss carry back rules  we recorded an income tax receivable of million at june  we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary for certain deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized through future reversals of existing temporary differences or available tax planning strategies 
we review the criteria related to the recognition of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
based on current tax laws  beginning in fiscal  we will not have remaining taxes paid within available net operating loss carry back periods 
as a result  the recognition of any additional net operating losses or deductable temporary differences is expected to be more limited than in years prior to fiscal  and a valuation allowance will be required to the extent that deferred tax assets exceed future reversals of then existing temporary differences or available tax planning strategies 
included in the balance at june  and are million and million  respectively  of net unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect our effective income tax rate 
during fiscal and fiscal  we accrued approximately million and thousand  respectively  of interest 
at june   we had approximately million accrued for interest and no amount accrued for the payment of penalties 
at june   we had approximately million accrued for interest and no amount accrued for the payment of penalties 
during fiscal  our income tax benefit increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in income tax benefit was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of pre tax losses between periods  partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate decreased to from an effective tax rate of for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to our inability to utilize state net operating losses  primarily in the commonwealth of massachusetts  which does not provide for a carry back or a carry forward of such losses 
subsequent events monogram loan programs as of september   we had begun to perform services under our loan program agreement with suntrust bank  and we expect to begin performing services under our loan program agreement with kinecta federal credit union by september  the loan program agreements each relate to school certified private education loan programs to be funded by these clients based on our monogram product 
we expect to facilitate up to an aggregate of million in loans over the terms 
table of contents of the two loan programs 
see business description of services  included in item of this annual report for additional information on our monogram product offering 
we will perform a range of services in support of the programs  including loan processing and management  and program administration services 
we generally provide these services on a fee for service basis  although we are also entitled to a portion of the yield generated by the portfolio of program loans in connection with certain administration services and for providing credit enhancement 
under both loan program agreements  we provide credit enhancement in the form of participation accounts  which are deposit accounts funded by us based on credit mix and volume of disbursed program loans  up to the participation cap  which is a dollar amount specified in the applicable loan program agreement 
the participation accounts for each client serve as a first loss reserve for defaulted program loans 
we are not required to fund participation accounts in excess of the participation cap specified in the applicable loan program agreements 
to the extent that loan volumes decrease as a result of repayments or default experience is less than our funded amounts  we would be eligible to receive a monthly release of funds from the participation accounts beginning in july  in the case of suntrust bank  and following expiration of the terms of our loan program agreement  in the case of kinecta federal credit union 
as of september   we have provided million in support of suntrust bank s monogram based loan program 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents and revenues from operations  and we expect to fund our long term liquidity requirements through revenues from operations and issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including expenses necessary to fund our operations  including the operations of union federal  the extent to which our services and products  including our monogram product  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the extent to which we contribute cash to clients or credit facility providers in connection with our monogram product  the regulatory capital requirements applicable to union federal see support of subsidiary bank below for additional information  the amount and timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residuals  the results of the audit conducted by the irs of our tax returns for fiscal years  and  which could result in adjustments to tax refunds previously received in connection with the sale of the trust certificate  and 
table of contents the timing  size  structure and terms of any securitization or other funding transactions that we structure  as well as the composition of the loan pool being securitized 
liquidity is required for capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  costs associated with alternative financing transactions  general corporate expenses  credit enhancement provided in connection with our monogram product and maintaining the regulatory capital of our bank subsidiary  union federal 
in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  we have taken certain broad measures to reduce the risk related to private education loans and residual receivables on our balance sheet  change our fee structure and add new products and reduce our overhead expenses 
see executive summary business trends and uncertainties above for an expanded description of actions taken by us during fiscal and fiscal in response to the economic challenges facing us 
in addition  our board of directors has eliminated regular quarterly cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock for the foreseeable future 
we had combined cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold  short term investments and investments held for sale of million and million  at june  and june   respectively 
of the million at june   approximately million was held by fmd and its non bank subsidiaries and approximately million was held by union federal 
in fiscal  we received a total of million in federal and state tax refunds for income taxes previously paid by us on our prior taxable income  and union federal received million from the sale of a portion of its private education loan portfolio to an unaffiliated third party 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  reflecting the receipt of the tax refunds and proceeds from the sale of the loans 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  reflecting the funding of operations and payment of taxes 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million  reflecting a net use of million by union federal to originate private education loans 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began processing loans based on our monogram product 
see note  subsequent events monogram loan programs  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional details 
we expect to receive fees for our services  and to retain a portion of the interest spread from the loans we facilitate offset by any contribution by us to fund participation accounts 
while we believe that we may be successful in completing negotiations with respect to the sale of our monogram product offering to additional potential lenders  we are uncertain as to how much loan volume may be originated by these lenders in fiscal we anticipate continuing to receive administrative and other fees related to our daily management and information gathering and reporting services for parties related to securitization trusts  as well as fees on a stand alone basis for loan portfolio management services 
we believe that these administrative and other fees  as well as management of our expenses  coupled with our significant cash  cash equivalents and investments  including the significant tax refunds received in fiscal and million in federal tax refunds expected to be received in fiscal  will be adequate to fund our operations in the short term as we seek to rebuild our client base and generate fee revenues through our monogram product over the short term and long term 
in addition  at june   we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding at june  or june  net interest income for fiscal  on a consolidated basis  was million  of which million was attributable to operations of union federal 
during the second quarter of fiscal  union federal sold its entire portfolio of private education loans held for sale  excluding the loans held by ufsb spv  union federal s subsidiary at that time 
subsequent to the loss of this source of net interest income  union federal has experienced monthly operating losses of approximately thousand 
in connection with our previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives for 
table of contents union federal  including a potential sale  we have adopted a conservative investment strategy  maintaining union federal s investable assets in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe this investment strategy will be viewed favorably by potential bidders 
due to the net losses union federal is currently generating  we believe a sale of union federal would have a positive impact on our consolidated earnings as well as providing enhanced liquidity to us through an additional cash infusion from the sale proceeds 
furthermore  we do not believe a sale of union federal would result in a material change to our ongoing operations because we do not expect union federal to offer private education loans during fiscal or to otherwise serve as a funding source 
in considering our short term and long term plans to increase cash inflows  we have taken into account the cash flows related to asset servicing fees recorded with respect to services provided to the third party purchaser of the trust certificate  as well as our other service revenue receivables  based on the private education loan performance assumptions as of june  despite the uncertainties discussed above  we believe  based on our operating plan that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations through fiscal cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to a net million of cash invested in short term investments  partially offset by a net reduction in federal funds sold 
cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to the net reductions in federal funds sold and investments held for sale  the proceeds of which were used to finance operating activities 
cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal reflected a higher volume of federal funds sold and equipment purchases  in part offset by net cash provided by the disposition of investments held for sale 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million reflected decreases in the volume of deposits and payments under capital leases and borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility 
cash payments related to the education loan warehouse facility are generally limited to cash received on the private education loans held for sale used as collateral 
see contractual obligations below for a more detailed discussion of required payments under the facility 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflected the net issuance proceeds of series b non voting convertible preferred stock of million  largely offset by a reduction in deposit levels and payments under capital leases and borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility 
in fiscal  at the request of the ots  we reduced the level of broker deposits at union federal by million  some of which we were able to offset by increases in other types of deposits 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflected the build up of the deposit balance at union federal  borrowings made under the education loan warehouse facility to fund private education loans reflected in cash used by operating activities and the issuance of common stock  less dividends paid 
the following table summarizes our time deposits at union federal greater than thousand by maturity at june  dollars in thousands within three months three to six months six months to one year over one year the maturities of these deposits are not directly indicative of future timing of cash needed for financing activities because they do not take into account the customers that may reinvest their funds into new time deposits or into other types of deposit accounts 

table of contents we had treasury stock of million and million at june  and  respectively 
our treasury stock balance was primarily derived from the repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
treasury stock also includes shares of our stock withheld from employees to satisfy statutory minimum withholding obligations as equity compensation awards vest 
the increase in treasury stock during fiscal was solely attributable to withholding obligations relating to compensation awards that vested 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
as of june   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares at an average price  excluding commissions  of per share  under this repurchase program 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to this repurchase program during fiscal or fiscal  and as of september   we do not plan to repurchase additional shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future 
future repurchases pursuant to this program may require regulatory approval 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by union federal directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
union federal is required to file a notice with the ots at least days before the proposed declaration of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by union federal s board of directors 
union federal must file an application to receive the approval of the ots for a proposed capital distribution when  among other circumstances  the total amount of all capital distributions including the proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
a notice or application to make a capital distribution by union federal may be disapproved or denied by the ots if it determines that  after making the capital distribution  union federal would fail to meet minimum required capital levels or if the capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns or is otherwise restricted by statute  regulation or agreement between union federal and the ots or the fdic or a condition imposed by an ots agreement 
under the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia  an fdic insured depository institution such as union federal is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdia 
support of subsidiary bank union federal is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements would initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our liquidity 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  union federal must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of union federal s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification  however  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
union federal s equity capital was million at june   down from million at june   due to dispositions of private education loans held for sale during the period and the generation of monthly operating losses 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require union federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets each as defined in the regulations 
as of june  and june   union federal was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in july  fmd entered into the supervisory agreement and union federal consented to the order  pursuant to which fmd and union federal agreed to comply with certain requirements imposed by the ots 
during fiscal  fmd and union federal complied in all material respects with the conditions set forth in the supervisory agreement and the order  respectively 
in march  
table of contents the ots terminated the supervisory agreement and the order  each in its entirety 
see note  union federal regulatory matters supervisory agreement and order to cease and desist  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional details 
in connection with the termination of the supervisory agreement  our board of directors adopted resolutions requiring fmd to support the implementation by union federal of its business plan  so long as union federal is owned or controlled by fmd  and to notify the ots in advance of any distributions to our shareholders in excess of million per fiscal quarter and any incurrence or guarantee of debt in excess of million 
following termination of the supervisory agreement and the order  fmd remains subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the ots as a savings and loan holding company  and union federal remains subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the ots and the fdic 
union federal s regulatory capital ratios were as follows as of the dates below regulatory guidelines minimum well capitalized june  june  risk based capital ratios tier capital total capital tier core capital ratio contractual obligations in july  ufsb spv  which was a subsidiary of union federal at the time  entered into a million education loan warehouse facility with a third party conduit lender 
the facility served as a source of interim financing for private education loan programs initially funded by union federal 
ufsb spv used advances under the facility to fund purchases of private education loans from union federal  which we refer to as the financed loans 
to secure its repayment obligations  ufsb spv granted a security interest to the conduit lender in certain collateral  including the financed loans 
neither fmd nor union federal is a borrower or co borrower under the facility  and the facility was structured to generally limit the conduit lender s recourse to the assets of ufsb spv  which consist almost exclusively of the financed loans 
at june  and june   million and million  respectively  were outstanding under the facility  which we restructured in april until april   the borrowings accrued interest at the prime rate plus 
following the debt restructuring entered into on april   and until april   outstanding notes under the facility accrue interest at a rate of the lender s cost of funds as specified in the indenture relating to the facility plus 
beginning april   the rate will increase to the lender s cost of funds plus 
principal and interest on each outstanding advance are paid on a monthly settlement date pursuant to the indenture  in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in the indenture 
principal and interest are paid out of amounts collected on the financed loans during the preceding month and deposited in a collection account pursuant to the indenture 
the facility termination date was declared by the conduit lender in april  and ufsb has not been eligible for further borrowings under the facility since that time 
all outstanding notes under the facility became due on july   and ufsb spv was unable to pay the outstanding notes in full 
as a result  the conduit lender has the right to foreclose on the collateral at any time in its discretion 
as of september   the conduit lender has elected not to exercise such right 
we expect the conduit lender to continue to require repayment of the outstanding notes from collections on the financed loans  until the outstanding notes are paid in full  if possible 
see note  liabilities and unused lines of credit education loan warehouse facility  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 

table of contents at june   we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  or june  we entered into two ten year fixed notes payable agreements with teri in june to fund the acquisition of teri s loan processing operations and loan database 
as a result of the teri reorganization  we have not made any scheduled payments on the notes outstanding since april the outstanding principal balance of the notes payable at june  was million 
as of september   we expect amounts outstanding under the notes to be offset against our claims against teri s bankruptcy estate 
we have future cash obligations under long term operating and capital leases for office space and office equipment 
the table below summarizes our future payments under contractual obligations as of june   excluding obligations to teri and borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility described above contractual obligations fiscal years ending june  capital leases operating leases total dollars in thousands none thereafter total as of september   we were in discussions to amend the lease relating to our medford  massachusetts location to  among other things  reduce the rented space by approximately  square feet by april  and extend the term of the lease to march  the table above does not reflect any changes to the terms of the lease in effect as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we offer outsourcing services in connection with private education loan programs  from program design through securitization of the loans 
we have structured and facilitated the securitization of private education loans for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of these trusts have been to generate sources of liquidity for our clients and union federal s assets sold into such trusts and make available more funds to students and colleges 
see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation above for a discussion of our determination to not consolidate these securitization trusts as of june  and the impact that newly issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted as of that date will have on our determination to consolidate these trusts 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk applies to all of our interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as service receivables 
credit risk is primarily related to private education loans held for sale  service receivables  mortgage loans  cash equivalents and investments 

table of contents interest rate risk the interest rate characteristics of our interest bearing assets are driven by the nature  volume and duration of our interest bearing liabilities 
generally  our interest bearing liabilities are either variable rate instruments or are of a short duration and are subject to frequent repricing at maturity 
less than of our fixed rate customer deposits at union federal have maturities in excess of twelve months from june  approximately of the deposits have variable interest rates or fixed interest rates with maturities of six months or less from june  deposit pricing is subject to weekly examination by a committee of senior managers from union federal and fmd s finance and risk and compliance departments 
the committee considers competitors pricing  inflows and outflows of deposit balances and union federal s funding requirements to make pricing decisions on the desired volume of deposits in each given duration and product type 
the frequent repricing of our liabilities drives our investment decisions 
all of our private education loans  and approximately of our mortgage loans  have variable interest rates 
interest rates on private education loans are based on the one month libor rate 
excess cash is primarily invested in money market funds  federal funds sold  time deposits with original maturities of less than one year and us federal agency mortgage backed securities 
the matching of the interest rate characteristics and duration of assets and liabilities mitigates interest rate risk with respect to net interest revenue 
however  we are still subject to interest rate risk because as interest rates decline  the spreads between our assets and liabilities narrow and net interest income may decline 
the fair value of private education loans held for sale and our service receivables will fluctuate due to variances in prepayments and discount rates  as well as the multi year forward estimates of libor  which is the reference rate for the loan assets and assumed borrowings assumptions used in our cash flow model 
we frequently monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we believe that we have adequately addressed interest rate risks in our cash flow models 
credit risk we manage cash  cash equivalents and investment assets conservatively 
the primary objective of our investment policy is the preservation of capital 
therefore  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments held for sale are placed with the federal reserve  or invested in federal funds sold  money market funds  deposits at highly rated institutions and government agency mortgage backed securities 
union federal offers conventional conforming and non conforming fixed and variable rate first and second residential mortgage loans  as well as commercial real estate loans 
we base our loan underwriting criteria primarily on credit score  consumer credit file information and collateral characteristics 
all mortgage loans are underwritten such that they are saleable to institutional investors 
union federal does not offer high loan to value second mortgages  option adjustable rate mortgages or sub prime mortgage products 
our assumptions regarding defaults and recoveries of securitized loans affect the expected timing of cash payments to us in respect of additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residual cash flows and our estimates of their fair value 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates included in item of this annual report
