the company s loss as a percentage of average assets for and was and  respectively  while the company s loss as a percentage of average shareholders equity was and  respectively 
the company s performance in was impacted by a number of significant items 
the major influences are a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during the fourth quarter of the impairment charge was a non cash event that was necessitated by a third party review of our carrying value 
the charge did not impact our regulatory capital ratios or our liquidity positions 
the company participated in two federally assisted acquisitions in the fourth quarter of these transactions resulted in net income of million  after tax 
at december   loans and deposits from these two transactions totaled million and million  respectively

index to financial statements credit costs increased materially over earlier years because of declines in credit quality 
several of the company s markets have experienced severe declines in real estate values and activity 
in addition  the strength of the company s borrowers has been affected by national and local economic conditions which has further exacerbated the costs of collateral shortages

the company s net interest margin declined only slightly during to from in opportunities to reduce deposit and funding costs in contributed to the successful effort to maintain steady net interest margins  despite a growing level of non performing assets and higher than normal levels of short term assets 
total assets ended at billion  in part due to the additional assets acquired in the company s fdic assisted transactions 
management had systematically reduced assets through successful efforts at reducing concentrations in construction and development loans and in commercial real estate loans 
this effort had reduced assets to approximately billion at the end of the third quarter of deposits and our deposit mix changed dramatically during management has focused significant efforts at increasing sales of transaction deposits with significantly less emphasis placed on time deposits 
these efforts combined with the current rate environment resulted in an increase in average transaction deposits of when compared to december  at the end of  transaction deposits interest bearing and non interest bearing demand increased to of total deposits  compared to of total deposits at december  at december   the bank had only million of non deposit borrowings outstanding and only million of brokered deposits  representing only of the bank s total funding 
critical accounting policies ameris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by ameris represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
an increase in interest rates by the federal reserve would favorably impact our net interest margin 
an improving economy could 
table of contents 
index to financial statements result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect our loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream 
conversely  certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and materially adversely impact our net earnings 
a significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower s ability to pay 
we will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy 
another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
we had three loans that exceed our in house credit limit of million 
total exposure to these three credits is million 
additional disclosure concerning the company s largest loan relationships is provided below 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors 
those loans are secured by real estate in our primary market areas 
a substantial portion of other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes to market conditions in our primary market area 
fair value accounting estimates generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities  as well as for specific disclosures 
the most significant include impaired loans and foreclosed property and the net assets acquired in business combinations 
certain of these assets do not have a readily available market to determine fair value and require an estimate based on specific parameters 
when market prices are unavailable  we determine fair values utilizing parameters  which are constantly changing  including interest rates  duration  prepayment speeds and other specific conditions 
in most cases  these specific parameters require a significant amount of judgment by management 
at december   the percentage of the company s assets measured at their fair value was 
see note fair value in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  following foreclosure 
the company s impaired loans and foreclosed property are concentrated in markets and areas where the determination of fair value through market research recent sales and or qualified appraisals is difficult 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in traditionally stable real estate environments 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate factors and allow ameris to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be different from management s determination of fair value 
assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value 
the fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities 
on the date of acquisition  when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments  the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non accretable difference 
the company must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date 
subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses 
subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income 
in addition  purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method 
income taxes gaap requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against 
table of contents

provisions for loan losses associated with loans where no loss has yet been recorded represent the company s largest deferred tax asset  totaling million 
the company does have deferred tax assets related to certain loss carryforwards 
for these assets  ameris believes there will be sufficient taxable income in the future to allow utilization of these loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where they exist 
long lived assets  including intangibles as in prior years  the company engaged an independent third party to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill 
during  it was determined that the balance of goodwill was impaired  and as such  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of goodwill

dollars in thousands predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent auditors and regulatory authorities  we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the bank operates 
factors considered include among others  current valuations of real estate in our markets  unemployment rates  the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 
we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve which is monitored by the company s senior credit officer 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides eight ratings of which four ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of reserve 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer and are often reviewed by independent third parties 
as a result of these loan reviews  certain loans may be assigned specific reserve allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific reserves 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  including underlying data and assumptions  is reviewed regularly by the company s chief financial officer as well as the director of internal audit 
during periodic reviews of the company s methodology  the company determined that additional reserves were potentially necessary to compensate for an increasingly negative economic outlook that prompted a few loan relationships to move to non performing status very quickly 
the company established an unallocated  economic related reserve in the amount of million that represents only that portion of the allowance for loan losses not allocated to specific loans as of december  during  the company determined a higher level of risk associated with certain loans and allocated this amount in its entirety to those loans 
accordingly  at december   the company has no unallocated reserve for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated 
management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidity and rate sensitivity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs  and the ability of our company to meet those needs 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally interest bearing deposits in banks and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
in addition  our company maintains relationships with correspondent banks including the fhlb and frb  which could provide funds on short notice  if needed 
a principal objective of our asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the portfolio due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  generally our loan with the longest maturity  are usually made with five to fifteen year maturities  but with either a variable interest rate or a fixed rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

index to financial statements yields were computed using coupon interest  adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization  as appropriate  on a ratable basis over the life of each security 
the weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the acquisition price of each security in that range 
yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable equivalent basis  using a tax rate of 
the investment portfolio consists of securities  including equity securities with readily determinable fair values  which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of the related deferred tax effect 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities 
realized gains and losses  determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold  are included in earnings on the settlement date 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
the company s methodology for determining whether other than temporary impairment losses exist include management considering the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral 
all unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade and the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity

generally  these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements and have been approved by the bank s local boards 
our bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
the bank uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee

the issuance and sale of these securities was a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act 
cumulative dividends on the preferred shares will accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but such dividends will be paid only if  as and when declared by the company s board of directors

capital regulations the capital resources of our company are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities

the increase is attributed to the issuance of the preferred shares under the cpp 
other capital related transactions  such as common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options and restricted stock  changes in unrealized losses on investment securities and repurchase of treasury shares combined to account for only a small change in the capital of the company

index to financial statements interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  we are somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis points increase or basis points decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
our most recent simulation model projects net interest income would decrease if rates rise basis points gradually over the next year 
a basis points decrease scenario is not meaningful at this time due to current market rates being at or near zero since the last reduction of the federal funds target rate by the federal reserve on december
