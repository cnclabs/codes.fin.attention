table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the hanover insurance group  inc and subsidiaries thg and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein 
our results of operations include the accounts of the hanover insurance company hanover insurance and citizens insurance company of america citizens  our principal property and casualty companies  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
our results of operations also included the results of first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic  our former run off life insurance and annuity subsidiary through december  on january   we sold faflic to commonwealth annuity and life insurance company commonwealth annuity  a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc goldman sachs 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  operations from faflic have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
additionally  as of december   faflic s balance sheet accounts were classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets 
executive overview our property and casualty business includes our personal lines segment  our commercial lines segment and our other property and casualty segment 
as noted above  on january   we sold faflic to commonwealth annuity 
total net proceeds from the sale after transaction expenses were approximately million 
coincident with the sale transaction  hanover insurance and faflic entered into a reinsurance contract whereby hanover insurance assumed faflic s discontinued accident and health insurance business 
during  the us and global financial markets and economies remain strained  as market values fluctuated significantly and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
defaults in corporate bonds may continue  particularly with respect to non investment grade securities 
credit spreads  however  tightened during the period  resulting in a substantial improvement in unrealized losses in compared to the prior year 
this improvement resulted in our investment portfolio having an unrealized gain position at december  although has shown positive momentum in the financial markets  uncertainty still exists in these markets  and with respect to the potential impact on our business of the current difficult economy 
our investment holdings totaled billion at december  and consist primarily of investment grade fixed maturities and cash and cash equivalents  with net unrealized gain positions of approximately million 
the improvement in our net unrealized investment position  from a loss in to a gain in  particularly in investment grade securities  is due primarily to market appreciation 
we recognized impairment charges of million during the year ended december  these impairment charges primarily related to credit related losses on below investment grade fixed maturities 
with respect to underwriting results  in we recorded pre tax catastrophe losses of million  a decrease of million from the same period in this was essentially offset by higher current year claims  lower favorable development on prior year s loss and loss adjustment expenses lae reserves  and higher expenses 
the higher current year claims were primarily the result of an unusually high level of non catastrophe weather related losses 
in light of these weather related losses  we have sought and will continue to seek additional rate increases in personal lines 
we and the industry in general continue to experience pricing pressures and in recent years the property and casualty industry has reported overall negative growth 
these pressures are particularly acute in michigan  which accounts for almost of our net written premium 
we believe that our ongoing agency relationships  position in the marketplace and strong product set  position us well in michigan relative to many of our competitors 
we have made an explicit decision to invest further in our business despite the fact that our expense ratio is higher than that of some of our peer companies and other competitors 
in personal lines  we are investing to improve the competitiveness of our products and in technology and systems enhancements intended to make our interactions with agents more efficient 
in commercial lines  most of our investments are directed toward expanding our product capabilities and offerings in various niches and differentiated products 
we continue to invest in systems improvements  particularly with respect to small commercial business 
in addition  we recently started to expand our commercial lines offerings into selected states in the western part of the country 
during may  am best company upgraded the financial strength ratings of our property and casualty companies to an a rating  from its prior rating of a 
am best also upgraded the rating related to our senior debt to bbb  from a prior rating of bbb 
we believe that these upgrades  which occurred at a time of uncertainty in the financial services industry  reflect the strength of our balance sheet  our solid capital position  and the results of our investments in the business over the past several years 

table of contents these upgrades are expected to provide access to certain business groups and markets  particularly in commercial lines  that have previously not been significant in our mix of business 
however  there can be no assurance that the ratings upgrades will produce the results expected 
personal lines in our personal lines business  the market continues to be very competitive  with continued pressure on agents from direct writers  as well as the increased usage of real time comparative rating tools 
we maintain our focus on partnering with high quality  value added agencies which stress the importance of account rounding  which is the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and or additional coverages  and consultative selling 
we are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability  build a distinctive position in the market  such as through our think hanover initiative  and provide us with profitable growth opportunities 
our think hanover investments are intended to enhance retention and strengthen our value proposition for agents  including by introducing broad and innovative product offerings 
we introduced a substantially improved product suite the hanover household and made it easier for agents to write more lines of business per household 
we also modified our operating model and agency automation which is intended to deliver a competitive sales and services experience for agents front line excellence 
current market conditions continue to be challenging as pricing pressures and economic conditions remain difficult  especially in michigan 
these competitive and economic pressures have adversely affected our ability to grow and retain business in michigan  our largest state  and elsewhere 
we are working closely with our partner agents in michigan and our other core states to remain a significant writer with strong margins 
in  we continued our mix management initiatives relating to our connections auto product to improve the overall profitability of the business 
we are focused on reducing our growth in less profitable automobile segments and increasing our multi car and total account business consistent with our account rounding strategy 
we believe that market conditions will remain challenging and competitive in personal lines 
despite these challenges  we experienced relatively flat growth levels in personal lines and expect that trend to continue into as the industry continues to be impacted by the difficult economic environment 
we believe that our connections auto product will help us profitably grow our market share over time 
the connections auto product is designed to be competitively priced for a wide spectrum of drivers through its multivariate rating application  which calculates rates based upon the magnitude and correlation of multiple risk factors 
at the same time  a core strategy is to broaden our portfolio offerings and write total accounts  which are accounts that include multiple personal line coverages for the same customer 
our homeowners product  connections home is intended to improve our competitiveness for total account business by making it easier and more efficient for our agents to write business with us and by providing more comprehensive coverage options for policyholders 
in addition  in states we have introduced a more sophisticated  multi variate pricing approach to our homeowners product which is designed to better align rates with the underlying risk of each customer 
we plan to continue to implement this more sophisticated price segmentation in our other states 
we also continue to refine our products and work closely with high potential agents to increase the percentage of business they place with us and to ensure that it is consistent with our preferred mix of business 
additionally  we remain focused on diversifying our state mix beyond our four core states of michigan  massachusetts  new york and new jersey 
we expect these efforts to contribute to profitable growth and improved retention in our personal lines segment over time 
commercial lines the commercial lines market remains competitive 
price competition requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business only at acceptable margins 
in certain lines of business where  in many instances  the economy may be a particularly important factor  such as surety and workers compensation  we have endeavored to adjust pricing to more appropriately reflect the higher risk of loss and or we take a more conservative approach to risk selections 
we focus on mid sized agents and target small and first tier middle market clients  whose premiums are generally below  we also continue to develop our specialty businesses  which on average are expected to offer higher margins over time and enable us to deliver a more complete product portfolio to our agents and policyholders 
our specialty lines  including marine and bond lines  now account for approximately one third of our commercial lines premiums written 
growth in our specialty lines continues to be a significant part of our strategy 
our ongoing focus on expanding our product offerings in specialty businesses is evidenced by our acquisitions 
over the past three years  we have acquired professionals direct  inc pdi  which we market as hanover professionals  a professional liability insurance carrier for principally small to medium sized legal practices  verlan holdings  inc verlan  which we market as hanover specialty property  a specialty company providing property insurance to small and medium sized 
table of contents chemical  paint  solvent and other manufacturing and distribution companies  and aix holdings  inc aix  a specialty property and casualty insurance carrier that focuses on underwriting and managing program business 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement through which we will acquire  subject to regulatory approvals  campania holding company  inc campania  which specializes in insurance solutions for the healthcare professionals industry  including durable medical equipment suppliers  behavioral health specialists  eldercare providers  and podiatrists 
also in january  we acquired benchmark professional insurance services  inc  a provider of insurance solutions to the design professionals industry  including architects and engineers 
in addition to our specialty lines  we have developed several niche insurance programs  such as for schools  religious institutions and moving and storage companies  and have added additional segmentation to our core middle market commercial products  including real estate  hospitality and wholesale distributors 
in january  we introduced a specialty niche for human services organizations such as non profit youth and community service organizations 
as a complimentary initiative  we have introduced products focused on management liability  specifically non profit directors and officers liability and employment practices liability  and we plan to extend coverage for private company directors and officers liability 
in december  we announced a renewal rights agreement with onebeacon insurance group onebeacon  further strengthening our competitive position and advancing our expansion efforts in the western states 
through the agreement  we acquired access to a portion of onebeacon s small and middle market commercial business at renewal  which includes industry programs and middle market niches 
at the same time  the transaction will expand our segment  niche and industry program business 
the agreement is effective for renewals beginning january  in addition  we have made a number of enhancements to our core products and technology platforms that are intended to drive more total account placements in our small commercial business  which we believe will enhance margins 
our focus continues to be on improving and expanding our partnerships with agents 
we believe our specialty capabilities and small commercial platform  coupled with increased distinctiveness in the middle market through these acquisitions  our development of niches  and better segmentation  provides us with a more diversified portfolio of products and enables us to deliver significant value to our agents and policyholders 
we believe these efforts will enable us to improve the overall mix of our business and ultimately our underwriting profitability 
description of operating segments our primary business operations include insurance products and services in three property and casualty operating segments 
these segments are personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
personal lines includes personal automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages  while commercial lines includes commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  workers compensation and other commercial coverages  such as inland marine  bonds  specialty program business  professional liability and management liability 
in addition  the other property and casualty segment consists of opus investment management  inc opus  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  earnings on holding company assets  as well as voluntary pools business in which we have not actively participated since prior to its sale on june   amgro  inc amgro  our premium financing business  was also included in the other property and casualty segment 
additionally  prior to the sale of faflic on january   our operations included the results of this run off life insurance and annuity business as a separate segment 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
we report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
corporate debt consists of our senior debentures  our junior subordinated debentures  surplus notes and advances under our collateralized borrowing program with the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb 
subordinated debentures were issued by the holding company and several subsidiaries 
results of operations our consolidated net income includes the results of our three operating segments segment income  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis  and our interest expense on corporate debt 
segment income excludes certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the 
table of contents cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
catastrophe losses are a significant component in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business 
however  catastrophic events  such as hurricanes katrina  ike and gustav make it difficult to assess the underlying trends in this business 
management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the million improvement is primarily due to a million improvement in our net realized investment position  from a loss in of million to a gain in of million 
additionally  results associated with the discontinued faflic business improved by million 
we recognized an million loss in due to its then pending sale  whereas in  we recognized a gain of million 
in  we also recognized a pre tax gain of million million net of taxes related to the retirement of corporate debt in connection with the repurchase of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and our senior debentures see also significant transactions 
these increases in earnings for the period compared to the same period in were partially offset by lower after tax segment results of million  and the recognition  in  of a million gain on the sale of amgro

the segment results are presented before taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations  including realized gains and losses

this decrease is primarily due to higher expenses  lower current accident year results  lower net investment income and lower favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves 
underwriting  loss adjustment and other operating expenses increased approximately million  of which approximately million relates to higher pension costs 
additionally  there were increased costs in our specialty lines  including the addition of our recently acquired aix subsidiary  higher employee and employee benefit costs and higher technology costs  partially offset by lower variable compensation 
current accident year results decreased by approximately million  primarily in personal lines  due to higher non catastrophe weather related losses throughout as compared to the prior year 
additionally  net investment income decreased by million and favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves decreased by million 
compared to the property and casualty group s segment income decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in catastrophe related activity increased million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily related to hurricanes ike and gustav in in addition  segment income was positively affected by a litigation settlement that resulted in an million benefit 
excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlement in  segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is due primarily to higher net investment income  more favorable current accident year results and lower expenses 
net investment income increased million  primarily due to earnings on invested assets transferred from our life companies and higher partnership income  partially offset by non recurring call premiums and prepayment fees received in and lower income due to the sale of securities to fund our stock repurchase program 
current accident year results improved approximately million in  primarily in commercial lines 
underwriting  loss adjustment and other operating expenses decreased approximately million  primarily due to lower employee benefit and variable compensation expenses  partially offset by increased costs in our specialty business  including our recently acquired subsidiaries 
included in employee benefit costs is an approximate million pension expense adjustment

we allocate net investment income to each of our property and casualty segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying business 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  the most significant factor contributing to lower net premiums written was a decrease in average premium size driven by changes in our premium mix toward what we expect to be more desirable account business that tends to have lower premium per policy commensurate with its better risk profile 
additionally  a decrease in premium from the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers car pool and increased reinsurance costs contributed to the decrease in net premiums written 
the decrease in car related premium followed the introduction  in april  of managed competition in massachusetts  which restructured the private passenger automobile insurance market in the state and resulted in reduced premiums from the involuntary market 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in net premiums written in our targeted growth states 
net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined  primarily as a result of declines in our core states of massachusetts  new york and new jersey of  and  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from lower policies in force in these core states 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business decreased during compared to  primarily driven by our efforts to improve or maintain margins in our core states 
decreased policies in force in these states were partially offset by an increase in 
table of contents policies in force in our identified growth states as we continue to manage these states with a focus on profitable growth 
net premium written in the homeowners line of business increased  driven by an increase in policies in force of compared to  and rate increases 
this increase in policies in force was primarily driven by increases across the majority of our states due to our account rounding initiatives  partially offset by a decrease in policies in force in florida  where throughout we non renewed all homeowners polices 
personal lines underwriting loss increased million  to a loss of million  compared to a loss of million in catastrophe losses decreased million in  to million  from million in the prior year 
excluding the impact of catastrophes  our underwriting income would have decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily due to less favorable current accident year results of approximately million  primarily due to higher non catastrophe weather related losses in the homeowners line caused by severe storms and higher claims severity across all personal lines  and to less favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves of million 
also contributing to the decrease was higher operating expenses of approximately million  primarily attributable to higher pension costs and higher technology costs 
although we have been able to obtain rate increases in our personal lines markets  our ability to maintain and increase personal lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results could be affected by increasing price competition  regulatory and legal developments and the difficult economic conditions  particularly in michigan  which is our largest state 
most of our new personal automobile business and an increasing proportion of our entire personal automobile business  currently approximately  is written with our connections auto product  with the remainder written with our legacy products 
connections auto is designed to match the rate with the underlying risk for segmented groups of customers in a highly competitive marketplace 
because of the competitiveness of this market  it generally has lower margins than our established book of legacy products 
our ability to grow and be profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to improve margins in the connections auto product and through our agency centric  account rounding strategy  particularly as connections auto products account for an increasing proportion of our total personal automobile business 
new business  whether written though our connections auto or legacy products  generally experiences higher loss ratios than our renewal business  and is more difficult to predict  particularly in states in which we have less experience and data 
our ability to maintain or increase earnings could be adversely affected if the loss ratios for new business on our rounded accounts do not meet our expectations 
however  we believe that complete accounts offer better profitability and retention over time 
our ability to grow could be adversely affected by adjustments to enhance risk segmentation and by agency management actions 
it is difficult to predict the impact that the current recessionary environment will have on our personal lines business 
our ability to increase pricing may continue to be impacted as agents and consumers become more price sensitive  customers shop for policies more frequently or aggressively  utilize comparative rating models or turn to direct sales channels rather than independent agents 
additionally  new business premiums  retention levels and renewal premiums may decrease as policyholders reduce coverages or change deductibles to reduce premiums  home values decline  foreclosures increase and policyholders retain older or less expensive automobiles and purchase or insure fewer ancillary items such as boats  trailers and motor homes for which we provide coverages 
additionally  claims frequency could increase as policyholders submit and pursue claims more aggressively than in the past  fraud incidences may increase  or we may experience higher incidence of abandoned properties or poorer maintenance which may also result in more claims activity 
we have also experienced higher incidents of claims for uninsured or underinsured policy coverages as a greater percentage of the motoring public eliminates or reduces their liability coverages  thus exposing our policyholders to the greater likelihood of making claims against their own uninsured or underinsured automobile coverages 
our personal lines segment could also be affected by an ensuing consolidation of independent insurance agencies 
in addition  as discussed under contingencies and regulatory matters other regulatory matters  certain states have taken  and others may take  actions which significantly affect the property and casualty insurance market  including ordering rate reductions for personal automobile and homeowners insurance products and subjecting insurance companies that do business in that state to onerous underwriting or other restrictions and potentially significant assessments 
such state actions or our responses thereto could have a significant impact on our underwriting margins and growth prospects  as well as on our ability to manage exposures to hurricane or other high risk losses 
notwithstanding these concerns  we believe that our agency distribution strategy  the strength of our market share in key states  our account rounding strategy  the relatively inelastic demand for insurance products and our capital position  place us in a good position to manage these issues and concerns relative to many of our peer competitors 

table of contents commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended this increase was driven by growth in our specialty businesses  including the addition of our recently acquired subsidiary  aix  which accounted for million  and growth in our hanover professionals and marine businesses  which accounted for million and million  respectively  as well as growth in various niche and segmented businesses 
also affecting the overall growth comparison in net premiums was improved rate  partially offset by increased reinsurance costs 
renewal retention in our core commercial lines decreased compared to the prior year  particularly in our workers compensation line  as we sought to improve our mix of business through a variety of pricing and underwriting actions in a very competitive environment 
additionally  our core lines premium was affected by a decrease in exposures in workers compensation and commercial multiple peril as a result of the difficult economic conditions 
commercial lines underwriting income increased million  to million  in  compared to million in catastrophe losses decreased million in  to million  from million in the prior year 
excluding the impact of catastrophes  our underwriting income would have decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses of approximately million  primarily attributable to increased costs in our specialty businesses  including our recently acquired subsidiaries  higher employee and employee benefit costs  higher pension costs and higher technology costs  partially offset by lower variable compensation 
current accident year results decreased approximately million  primarily due to economic factors impacting our surety bond business 
these decreases were partially offset by increased favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves of million 
we continue to experience significant price competition in all lines of business in our commercial lines segment 
the industry is also experiencing overall rate decreases 
our ability to increase commercial lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results is expected to be affected by price competition and the difficult economic conditions 
it is difficult to measure and predict the impact of the current difficult economic environment on our commercial lines segment 
we have and may continue to experience decreased new business levels  retention and renewal rates and renewal premiums 
the overall decline in the economy has resulted in reductions in demand for insurance products and services as more companies cease to do business and there are fewer business start ups  particularly as small businesses are affected by a decline in overall consumer and business spending 
in addition  economic conditions may also continue to impact our surety bond business  especially in the small to middle market contractor business 
in addition  some businesses have reduced or eliminated coverages to reduce costs and there has been a reduction in payroll levels  which has reduced workers compensation premiums without a corresponding decrease in workers compensation losses 
our commercial lines segment could also be affected by an ensuing consolidation of independent insurance agencies 
notwithstanding these concerns  we believe that our agency distribution strategy  our broad product offerings  the strength of our growing specialty businesses  disruptions in the marketplace which may result in improved pricing and new business  the relatively inelastic demand for insurance products and our capital position  place us in a good position to manage these issues and concerns relative to many of our peer competitors 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the decrease is primarily due to million of higher pension costs related to our discontinued life business  partially offset by million of higher favorable development in our run off voluntary pools 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  the most significant factor contributing to this increase was a favorable impact from changes in our reinsurance structure as discussed on pages and in description of business by segment property and casualty of our form k  which increased net written premium by million for the year ended december  in the personal automobile and homeowners lines of business  rate increases in all states except for massachusetts also contributed to the increase 
additionally  net written premium benefited from an increase in new personal automobile policies issued in massachusetts and from increases in new homeowners policies issued across most states 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net written premium related to our non renewal of homeowners business in florida  the impact of personal automobile rate decreases in massachusetts and a decrease in net written premium in michigan  which we attribute to the difficult economy in the state 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business decreased during driven by a decrease in 
table of contents michigan  which we attribute to the difficult economic conditions in that state  partially offset by net growth in policies in force in massachusetts 
policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased during  primarily as a result of exposure management actions taken in coastal states  particularly in florida  where we have non renewed all homeowners policies 
partially offsetting these reductions is an increase in policies in force outside of florida  primarily in our targeted growth states 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  decreased million  to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily due to less favorable current accident year results of approximately million  attributable to higher frequency of non catastrophe weather related claims  partially offset by the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs 
additionally  underwriting expenses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately million higher in primarily due to expenses being reduced by a litigation recovery of million 
this was partially offset by lower variable compensation and employee benefit costs in as compared to favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves excluding hurricane katrina decreased million  to million in  from million in this decrease was driven primarily by lower favorable development in the personal automobile line of business  particularly from bodily injury 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes increased million  to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by hurricane gustav  and to a lesser extent  hurricane ike  in we also increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million in we did not increase our reserves for hurricane katrina in commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs and the effect of net premiums written related to recently acquired subsidiaries 
during and as discussed under reinsurance on page in description of business by segment property and casualty of our form k  we renewed our property and casualty reinsurance program with changes to the reinsurance structure 
these changes resulted in an increase in net written premium of million in net written premium attributable to our recent acquisitions of pdi  verlan and aix  was million in the remaining premium increase was primarily in our bond business 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year results of approximately million  primarily attributable to growth in specialty lines and the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs 
these increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and loss adjustment expenses of approximately million  primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with our specialty lines of business  including our recently acquired subsidiaries  partially offset by lower variable compensation and employee benefit costs 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  to million in from million in this increase primarily relates to the commercial multiple peril and workers compensation lines of business  partially offset by decreases in the commercial automobile and other commercial lines of business 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes increased million  to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by hurricane ike  and to a lesser extent  hurricane gustav  in in and  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million and million  respectively 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase is primarily due to lower pension related costs 
investment results net investment income before taxes was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in net investment income in compared to was primarily due to a decline in new money yields  to the utilization of fixed maturities to fund the repurchase of our corporate debt and to lower partnership income 
these decreases were partially offset by the addition of investment income from investments held by our recently acquired subsidiaries and also by higher prepayment fees 
the increase in net investment income in compared to was primarily due to earnings on pension and benefit related invested assets transferred from our former life companies segment to the property and casualty group 
effective january   hanover insurance became the common employer of all employees of thg and its subsidiaries and sponsorship of all employee benefit plans was transferred from faflic to hanover insurance 
accordingly  we transferred assets from faflic to 
table of contents hanover insurance with corresponding liabilities associated with these benefit plans 
additionally  net investment income increased due to higher partnership income in these increases were partially offset by non recurring call premiums and prepayment fees received in and lower income due to the sale of securities to fund our stock repurchase program 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities were for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses our loss reserves with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  taking into account past loss experience  modified for current trends  as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
loss reserves represent our largest liability 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date 
they also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
case reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy 
for some classes of business  average case reserves are used initially 
case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim 
ibnr reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business  coverage and accident year for all loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves 
the sum of the case reserves and the ibnr reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred or are expected to occur in the future in aggregate and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which may not yet be known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
ibnr represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses and loss expenses 
management s process for establishing loss reserves is primarily based on the results of our reserving actuaries quarterly reserving process  however  there are a number of other factors in addition to the actuarial point estimates as further described under the section below entitled loss and lae reserves by line of business 
in establishing our loss reserves  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
management s review of judgments and key assumptions we determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is a combination of objective and subjective information  the blending of which requires significant actuarial and business judgment 
there are various assumptions required including future trends in frequency and severity of claims  trends in total loss costs  operational changes in claim handling processes  and trends related to general economic and social conditions 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
given the inherent complexity of our loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly in those instances where settlements do not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations 

table of contents there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business  particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines  by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business  such as the program business written by our recently acquired aix subsidiary 
in such cases  there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely 
historically  we have limited the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
with the acquisition of hanover professionals in  which writes lawyers professional errors and omissions coverage  and the introduction of management liability and other new specialty coverages  we are modestly increasing and expect to continue to increase our exposure to longer tailed liability lines  including d o coverages 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation and increasing medical costs in the projection of ultimate costs 
we have experienced increasing medical and attendant care costs  including those associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us  and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
as discussed below  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively  which represents  and of net loss reserves held  respectively 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
additionally  there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses  for which we have limited historical claims experience 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 

table of contents we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  including in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see also contingencies and regulatory matters 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
we have fully utilized all of our available reinsurance with respect to losses and lae related to hurricane katrina 
loss and lae reserves by line of business reserves other than those relating to asbestos and environmental claims our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage  homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these coverages  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is less complex 
while of our written premium is in short tailed classes of business  most of our loss reserves relate to longer tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include commercial liability  automobile liability  workers compensation and other types of third party coverage 
for many liability claims  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations  the legal environment and the expense of protracted litigation 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability compared to short tail coverages 
most of our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools is long tail casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and the management  claims handling and actuarial judgment of the pool manager 
our reserving actuaries  who are independent of the business units  perform a comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write at the end of each quarter 
this review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims  including the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of this process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss methods bornheutter ferguson  and adjusted loss methods berquist sherman 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed so far 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
bornheutter ferguson methods calculate ibnr directly for each accident year as the product of expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid obtained from the loss development factor methods 
expected ultimate losses are determined by multiplying the expected loss ratio times earned premium 
the expected loss ratio uses loss ratios from prior accident years adjusted to reflect current revenue and cost levels 
the expected loss ratio is a critical component of bornheutter ferguson and provides a general reasonability guide for all reserving methods 
berquist sherman methods are used in cases where historical development patterns may be deemed less optimal for use in estimating ultimate losses of recent accident 
table of contents years 
under these methods  patterns of historical paid or reported losses are first adjusted to reflect current payment settlement patterns and case reserve adequacy and then evaluated in the same manner as the paid or reported loss development factor methods described above 
the reported loss development factor method can be less appropriate when the adequacy of case reserves suddenly changes  while the paid loss development factor method can likewise be less appropriate when settlement patterns suddenly change 
for some low volume and high volatility classes of business  special reserving techniques are utilized that estimate ibnr by selecting the loss ratio that balances actual reported losses to expected reported losses as defined by the estimated underlying reporting pattern 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each line of business  coverage and accident year 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods when applied to a particular class of business can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by line of business and coverage  and by accident year based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries  and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect ultimate losses 
for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a reasonably stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes in the vast majority of cases  the loss development factor method is generally appropriate 
in certain cases where there is a relatively low level of reliability placed on the available paid and incurred loss data  expected loss methods or adjusted loss methods are considered appropriate for the most recent accident year 
for long tail lines of business  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail lines of business with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg  personal automobile liability  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  even in the most recent accident years  but expected loss methods and adjusted loss methods are always considered and frequently utilized in the selection process 
for those long tail lines of business with low frequency and high loss potential eg  commercial liability  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
in these situations  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the actuarial estimates for these accident years are based on methods less reliant on extrapolation  such as bornheutter ferguson 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods or adjusted loss methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each line of business  coverage and accident year based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
as stated above  numerous factors both internal and external contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves  including changes in the rate of inflation for goods and services related to insured damages eg  medical care  home repairs  etc  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions  changes in the general attitude of juries in determination of damages  legislative actions  changes in the extent of insured injuries  changes in the trend of expected frequency and or severity of claims  changes in our book of business eg  change in mix due to new product offerings  new geographic areas  etc  changes in our underwriting norms  and changes in claim handling procedures and or systems 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 

table of contents in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
as a result of these potential issues  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have further complicated the already complex loss reserving process 
for example  in the state of michigan  tort compensation for non economic damages for example  pain and suffering caused by ownership or use of a motor vehicle is limited by statute to circumstances where the injured person suffered death  serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement 
the application of this statute has been defined by the supreme court of michigan in the so called kreiner decision 
accordingly  we establish our loss picks and our claim  ibnr and loss adjustment expense reserves based upon our understanding of the current state of the law 
there have been and currently are efforts to change the controlling statute or judicial interpretation in ways which would expand an injured person s right to sue for non economic damages 
if implemented  such changes may not only impact future claims  but also past claims which are not settled and therefore an unfavorable adjustment to existing loss reserves could be required 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a line of business and coverage 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each line of business and coverage  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience  as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions  the cost of litigation or determining liability and the ultimate loss  inflation and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate  and as a result  do not have reserve range estimates to disclose 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following tables and related discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current actuarial estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for the primary long tail coverages within our major lines of business which typically represent the areas of greatest uncertainty in our reserving process 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future  and are provided to illustrate the relationship between claim reporting patterns and expected loss ratios  respectively  on actuarial loss reserve estimates for the lines identified 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore its impact on our results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below and for any such variations to be recognized in a single quarterly or annual period 
as noted  the following tables illustrate the relationship between the impact on our actuarial loss reserve estimates of reasonably likely variations to claim reporting patterns and expected actuarial estimates of ultimate loss costs  two key actuarial assumptions used to estimate our net reserves at december   from the assumptions utilized by our actuaries 
the five point change to our expected loss 
table of contents ratio selections  which incorporate variability in both ultimate frequency and severity  are within the historical variation present in our prior accident year development 
the three month change to reporting patterns represent claims reporting that is both faster and slower than our current reporting assumption for reported loss patterns and this degree of change is within the historical variation present in actual reporting patterns 
a faster reporting pattern results in lower indicated net loss reserves due to the presumption that a higher proportion of ultimate claims have been reported thus far  and therefore  a lower proportion of ultimate claims needs to be carried as ibnr 
a slower reporting pattern results in higher indicated net loss reserves due to the presumption that a lower proportion of ultimate claims have been reported thus far  and therefore  a higher proportion of ultimate claims need to be carried as ibnr 
the results show the cumulative dollar difference between our current actuarial estimate and the estimate that we would develop if our understanding with respect to loss reporting patterns and ultimate loss costs were different by three months or five points  respectively 
no consideration has been given to potential correlation or lack of correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business and coverage 
as a result  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility in total 
while we believe these are reasonably likely scenarios  we do not believe the reader should consider the below sensitivity analysis as an actual reserve range 
expected dollar effect on actuarial loss reserve estimates personal automobile bodily injury in millions change in expected loss ratio reporting pattern points lower unchanged points higher months faster unchanged months slower example personal automobile bodily injury  if losses are actually developing and emerging three months slower than we anticipate in our models  our actuarial estimate for this coverage would be understated by million 
if our assumed payment patterns are consistent with our expectations  but the expected loss ratio in our model is too low  then our actuarial estimate for this coverage would be understated by million 
expected dollar effect on actuarial loss reserve estimates workers compensation indemnity in millions change in expected loss ratio reporting pattern points lower unchanged points higher months faster unchanged months slower workers compensation medical in millions change in expected loss ratio reporting pattern points lower unchanged points higher months faster unchanged months slower commercial multiple peril liability in millions change in expected loss ratio reporting pattern points lower unchanged points higher months faster unchanged months slower senior management meets with our reserving actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest actuarial loss reserve analysis 
management s evaluation process to determine our ultimate losses includes various quarterly reserve committee meetings  culminating with the approval of single point best estimates by our chief financial officer that reflect but often differ from our actuarial reserve analysis 
based on this quarterly process  management determines the carried reserve for each line of business and coverage and assesses the reasonableness of the difference between recorded and actuarially indicated reserves 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past  the level of volatility within a particular class of business  general economic trends  and other factors not fully captured in the actuarial reserve analysis 
in doing so  management must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
even if a change is determined to be apparent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 

table of contents the table below shows our recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  and the related actuarial reserve point estimates by line of business at december  and december in millions recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate personal automobile homeowners other personal lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial lines asbestos and environmental pools and other total the principal factors considered by management  in addition to the actuarial point estimates  in determining the reserves at december  and vary by line of business 
in our commercial lines segment  management considered the growth and product mix changes and recent adverse frequency and severity trends in certain coverages 
in addition  management also considered the significant growth in our inland marine and bond businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate losses and the product mix change in our bond business towards a greater proportion of contract surety bonds where higher loss trends have emerged in related to declining general economic conditions 
moreover  in our commercial lines segment  although frequency trends in our workers compensation line have been favorable throughout  management considered the potential for adverse development in this line where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time  trends are cyclical related to general economic conditions  and rising medical costs  while moderating  have continued to be a concern 
with the acquisitions and associated growth of hanover professionals and aix  we are modestly increasing our exposure to longer tailed liability lines and there is less historical experience and less actuarial data available  all of which results in less certainty when estimating ultimate reserves 
also  higher retentions on our reinsurance program  beginning january   compared to prior years  may impact the emergence of trends in underlying data that could add to the uncertainty and variability of our actuarial estimates going forward 
in our commercial multiple peril line  although the adverse loss frequency trends observed in have moderated during  management considered the potential for adverse development due to increasing legal defense costs related to exposures  such as personal injury  advertising injury  chinese drywall  and other complex cases that may continue to trend higher than expected 
in our personal lines segment  management considered the adverse automobile personal and bodily injury frequency and development trends in the and accident years and the related potential for continued adverse trends due to costs shifting from health insurers to property and casualty insurers resulting from continued economic concerns and health insurance coverage trends  the potential impact of the michigan supreme court s pending review of the so called kreiner decision and developments in automobile property and physical damage costs in the and accident years  all of which have added additional uncertainty to future development in our personal automobile line 
additionally  management considered the growth in our new business with our connections auto product and related growth in a number of states where there is additional uncertainty in the ultimate profitability and development of reserves due to the unseasoned nature of our new business and new agency relationships in these markets  as well as emerging loss trends which continue to be higher than expected 
although our experience and data in these areas is growing with the passage of time  a sufficient number of years of actuarial data is not yet available to base loss estimates solely on this data in new geographical areas and agency relationships and with new products 
as a results  there is less certainty when estimating ultimate reserves and more judgment by management is required 
although management believes that the likelihood of future adverse development related to hurricanes katrina  ike and gustav as of december  is lower compared to a year prior  there is still the potential for adverse development related to these events  as well as to our catastrophe losses  primarily in the homeowners and commercial multiple peril lines 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other factors 
at december  and  total recorded net reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated reserves  respectively

prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
the following table summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina see management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k for a further discussion of hurricane katrina by line of business

the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected severity of bodily injury in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the through 
table of contents accident years and lower than expected severity in the commercial multiple peril line  primarily in the through accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the bond line  lower projected losses in our run off voluntary pools and lower projected exposures to asbestos and environmental liability for our direct written business contributed to the favorable development 
partially offsetting the favorable development was unfavorable non catastrophe weather related property loss development of million  primarily related to our homeowners  commercial property and personal automobile physical damage lines  which developed unfavorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected severity of bodily injury in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  and lower than expected severity of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the though accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the through accident years  contributed to the favorable development 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected bodily injury and personal injury protection claim severity in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  and lower than expected severity of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the and prior accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation and other commercial lines  also primarily in the through accident years  contributed to the favorable development 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
a change in our actuarial methodology for estimating loss adjustment expense reserves increased favorable development of prior year lae reserves by million in the favorable development in was primarily attributable to the aforementioned improvement in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years  primarily in the commercial multiple peril line 
the favorable development in is primarily attributable to improvements in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years  primarily in the commercial multiple peril line  partially offset by an adverse litigation settlement in the first quarter of  primarily impacting the personal automobile line 
although we have experienced significant favorable development in both losses and lae in recent years  there can be no assurance that this level of favorable development will occur in the future 
we believe that we will experience less favorable prior year development in future years than we experienced recently 
the factors that resulted in the favorable development of prior year reserves  including the aforementioned change in lae reserve methodology  are considered in our ongoing process for establishing current accident year reserves 
in light of our recent years of favorable development  the factors driving this development were considered to varying degrees in setting the more recent years accident year reserves 
as a result  we expect the current and most recent accident year reserves not to develop as favorably as they have in the past 
in light of the significance  in recent periods  of favorable development to our property and casualty group s segment income  declines in favorable development could be material to our results of operations 
asbestos and environmental reserves although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos and environmental damage liability through specific policy exclusions  we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures 
the following table summarizes our asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools 
for the years ended december in millions asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total beginning reserves incurred losses and lae paid reimbursed losses and lae ending reserves

in recent years  average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly 
as a result of the declining payments  our actuarial indicated point estimate of asbestos and environmental liability reserves was lowered resulting in favorable reserve development of million during the year ended december  during  our asbestos and environmental reserves decreased by million  primarily due to a favorable cash recovery from a reinsurer on a prior year environmental claim 
during  we reduced our asbestos and environmental reserves by million 
as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos and environmental damage liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  and not included in the numbers above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos and environmental damage liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
a significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in runoff 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately million annually over the past ten years 
during the year ended december   our ecra pool reserves were lowered by million as the result of an actuarial study completed by the ecra pool 
management reviewed the ecra actuarial study  concurred that the study was reasonable  and adopted its actuarial point estimate 
in addition  during the year  management recorded favorable development of million on a separate large claim settlement within these pools 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 
we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability claims  whether resulting from direct business  assumed reinsurance or pool business  based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant or similar claims may arise 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
nevertheless  the asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised  and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position 
reinsurance our property and casualty group maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
we utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses  stabilize earnings and protect capital resources  including facultative reinsurance  excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured  exposure analyses prepared by consultants and or reinsurers  our capital allocation models and on market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms and conditions with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements  reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies  and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us  as the ceding insurer  from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow  ice storm  windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
there were no ceded losses under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements in  and million and million in and  respectively 
in  we purchased catastrophe reinsurance coverage  which provided for maximum loss coverage limits of million and a combined co participation and retention level of million of losses for a single event 
also  effective july   for a twelve month term  we purchased an additional million layer and a co participation of million of losses for a single event in the northeast 
the program contains 
table of contents an automatic reinstatement premium provision in the event we exhaust this maximum coverage 
although we believe our retention and co participation amounts for and are appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment  there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during additionally  as a result of the current economic environment as well as losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years  the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods 
we may not be able to pass these costs on to policyolders in the form of higher premiums or assessments 
we also are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to conduct certain businesses in various states  we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include  among others  the michigan assigned claims facility and the michigan catastrophic claims association

table of contents other than temporary impairments cumulative effect as more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements  we account for other than temporary impairments otti in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities asc formerly included under fasb staff position no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
on april   we adopted accounting guidance that is now included in asc  which required us to modify our assessment of otti on debt securities  as well as our method of recording and reporting otti 
in accordance with asc  we reviewed otti previously recorded through realized losses on securities held at april   which were million  and determined that million of these impairments were related to non credit factors  such as interest rates and market conditions 
accordingly  we increased the amortized cost basis of these debt securities and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million within shareholders equity 
the cumulative effect adjustment had no effect on total shareholders equity as it increased retained earnings and reduced accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the new accounting guidance  if a company does not intend to sell the debt security  or more likely than not will not be required to sell it  the credit loss portion of an other than temporary impairment is recorded through earnings while the portion attributable to all other factors is recorded separately as a component of other comprehensive income 
other than temporary impairments for the year ended december   we recorded million of other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities  of which million was recognized in earnings and the remaining million was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income 
otti recognized in earnings in primarily included losses on below investment grade fixed maturities of million  principally from corporate bonds in the industrial sector  and million from perpetual preferred securities  primarily in the financial sector 
in  we recognized otti of million  resulting from credit related losses on corporate bonds  particularly in the financial sector and in certain higher yielding  below investment grade fixed maturities 
otti in included million related to the financial sector  million related to the industrial sector and million related to the utilities sector 
approximately million of impairments were related to investment grade fixed maturities  million to below investment grade fixed maturities and million to equities and other investments 
in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  and with respect to equity securities  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery in value 
we apply these factors to all securities 
we monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  and we consider past events  current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists 
for our impairment review of asset backed fixed maturity securities  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery 
we consider all available information relevant to the collectibility of the security  including information about the remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer  industry analyst reports  sector credit ratings and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows 
when an other than temporary impairment of a debt security occurs  and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per 
table of contents share 
if we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it  we separate the other than temporary impairment into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
the amount of the estimated other than temporary impairment that is non credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
we estimate the amount of the other than temporary impairment that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the debt security with the net present value of the debt security s projected future cash flows  discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment 
the non credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the fixed maturity security at the impairment measurement date 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities are recorded as realized losses  which reduce net income and earnings per share 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share  but reduce other comprehensive income  which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future

we view the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term  as evidenced by the improvement 
table of contents in unrealized losses during the year  allowing us to realize their anticipated long term economic value 
with respect to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities  we do not intend to sell nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell fixed maturity securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost see also liquidity and capital resources 
with respect to equity securities  we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  the global economic slowdown is longer or more severe than we expect  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  an other than temporary impairment would be recognized 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations  with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers

our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be and have been significantly impacted by the changes in market values of our securities 
during  there were significant declines in the market values of our fixed maturity securities  particularly in the industrial and financial sectors 
although we have seen substantial improvement in unrealized losses in  economic conditions remain strained  market values could continue to fluctuate  and defaults on corporate fixed income securities could increase 
as a result  depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and or financial position 
we experienced defaults in on certain fixed maturities of issuers in the industrial sector 
the carrying values of fixed maturity securities on non accrual status at december  and were not material 
the effects of non accruals for the years ended december  and  compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities  were reductions in net investment income of million and million  respectively 
any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income 
recent developments have illustrated that the us and global financial markets and economies  while beginning to recover  are in an unprecedented period of uncertainty and instability 
many issuers continue to face adverse business and liquidity circumstances  increasing the possibility of unanticipated defaults during while we may experience defaults on fixed income securities in  particularly with respect to non investment grade securities  it is difficult to foresee which issuers  industries or markets will be affected 
as a result  the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods 
market risk and risk management policies interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio 
in a rising interest rate environment  the value of the fixed income sector  which comprises of our investment portfolio  may decline as a result of decreases in the fair value of the securities 
our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par 
however  our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets or our analysis of an issuer s credit metrics and prospects 
interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result  profitability 
the portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities 
table of contents with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates 
the resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields 
in a rising interest rate environment  the funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates 
the following table illustrates the estimated impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  of hypothetical changes in prevailing interest rates  defined as changes in interest rates on us treasury debt 
it does not reflect changes in credit spreads  liquidity spreads and other factors that affect the value of securities 
since changes in prevailing interest rates are often accompanied by changes in these other factors  the reader should not assume that an actual change in interest rates would result in the values illustrated

income taxes we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its domestic subsidiaries including non insurance operations 
the provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations were expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these provisions resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of   and on pre tax income for   and  respectively 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement with the irs of interest claims for tax years through the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement with the irs of tax years through absent this benefit  the effective tax rate for would have been 
both the increase in the tax rate and the decrease in the tax rate result from changes in our valuation allowance related to realized loss carryforwards 
in  we believed that we would not realize the tax benefits related to the realized investment losses occurring in that year 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance so as to avoid recognition of these tax benefits 
in  we determined that we could realize a portion of our realized loss carryforwards from prior years 
accordingly  we reduced our valuation allowance  resulting in a tax rate for that is less than the statutory rate 
our federal income tax expense on segment income was million for compared to million in and million in the decreases in and were primarily due to lower segment income 
in addition to the aforementioned benefits from our settlement of ongoing irs audits  we also realized similar tax benefits in our discontinued operations 
in  a benefit of million resulting from the settlement with the irs 
table of contents of interest claims for through was recognized in discontinued operations as income related to our discontinued faflic business 
during  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle 
a benefit of million was recognized in discontinued operations as income related to our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business and a tax expense of million was recognized related to our discontinued faflic business 
in december  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle 
the resulting assessment of federal income tax was offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards related to our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business 
the recognition of these net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations as an adjustment to the loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business 
a benefit of million  also related to variable life insurance and annuity items from to was recognized in discontinued operations as income from a former life insurance subsidiary 
also in  a benefit of million resulting from the settlement with the irs of interest claims for through was recognized in discontinued operations as income from discontinued faflic business 
finally  reflects a benefit of million due to reductions in our federal income tax reserves from clarification of outstanding issues for prior years in the course of ongoing irs audits 
the recognition of this benefit was recorded in discontinued operations as income in discontinued faflic business 
the irs audit for tax years through commenced in december in september   we received a revenue agents report for the to irs audit 
we have agreed to all proposed adjustments other than a disallowance of separate account dividends received deductions for which we have requested an appeals conference 
due to available net operating loss carryovers and the sale of allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company  the effects of the proposed adjustments should not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in january  we completed a transaction which resulted in the realization  for tax purposes only  of million of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio 
as a result  we are able to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset this gain in the same amount 
thus  as of december   we released million of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance release increased other comprehensive income by million and increased income from continuing operations by million 
during  we reduced our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets by million in total  from million to million 
there are four components to this reduction 
first  we reversed  through other comprehensive income  the million valuation allowance that we had recognized at december  associated with the tax benefit related to net unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio at that time 
during  appreciation in the portfolio changed the nature of the tax attribute from that of an asset to that of a liability  and thus there was no longer a need for that portion of the valuation allowance 
second  as a result of the transaction described in the previous paragraph  we reversed million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to other comprehensive income and million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to income from continuing operations 
third  as a result of million in net realized gains reflected in income from continuing operations during  we reversed million of our valuation allowance as an adjustment to income from continuing operations 
finally  we increased our valuation allowance by million  related to million in net realized losses reflected in discontinued operations during this increase is reflected in income from discontinued operations 
the net effect of all of these items is the aforementioned million net reduction in our valuation allowance 
included in our deferred tax net asset as of december  is an asset of million related to capital loss carryforwards which will expire beginning in our pre tax capital losses carried forward are million  including million resulting from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business in and million resulting from the sale of faflic 
of the aforementioned million tax asset  we expect to realize million as a result of the transaction implemented in january described above 
at december   we have a valuation allowance against the remaining million  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this portion of the asset will not be realized 
our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of capital loss carryforwards may change over time 
at december   we had a deferred tax asset of million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date 
we may utilize the credits to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income  and although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable  there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the revised accounting for uncertainty in income taxes now included in asc  income taxes asc 
as a result of this implementation  we recognized an million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was reflected as an increase in the january  balance of retained earnings 
a corporation is entitled to a tax deduction from gross income for a portion of any dividend which was received from a domestic corporation that is subject to income tax 
this is referred to as a dividends received deduction 
in prior years  we have taken this dividends received deduction when filing our federal income tax return 
many separate accounts held by life insurance companies receive dividends from such domestic corporations  and therefore  were regarded as entitled to this dividends received deduction 
in its revenue ruling  issued on september   the irs announced its intention to issue regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the dividends received deduction on separate account assets held in connection with variable annuity contracts 
revenue ruling suspended a revenue ruling issued in august that purported to change accepted industry and irs interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions 
any regulations that the irs ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment  at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the content  scope and application of such regulations 
as a result  the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are not yet known  but they could result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account dividends received deduction tax benefit that we receive 
we believe that it is more likely than not that any such regulation would apply prospectively only  and application of this regulation is not expected to be material to our results of operations in any future annual period 
however  there can be no assurance that the outcome of the revenue ruling will be as anticipated 
we believe that retroactive application would not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  as part of the audit of and  the irs disallowed our dividends received deduction relating to separate account assets for both years and we have challenged the disallowance by filing a formal protest  and have requested an irs appeals conference 
as discussed above  should we ultimately be unsuccessful in our challenge  due to tax attributes and the sale of allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company  the effects of this proposed adjustment should not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data on pages to of this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves see segment results reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on pages to of this form k for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for loss reserves 
property and casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to a reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 

table of contents pension benefit obligations prior to  we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula 
in addition to the cash balance allocation  certain transition group employees  who had met specified age and service requirements as of december   were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment 
as of january   the defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits formerly included under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements    and r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans  we must make various estimates and key assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
in addition  we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with this plan 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
we also use this discount rate in the determination of our pre tax pension expense or benefit 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
as of december  and  we determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plan 
bond information used in the yield curve was provided by standard and poor s and included only those rated aa or better as of december  and  respectively 
at december   based upon our qualified plan assets and liabilities in relation to this discount curve  we decreased our discount rate to  from at december  to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
for the years ended december  and  the expected rate of return on plan assets was and  respectively 
the decrease reflects our strategy to shift investment assets from equity securities to fixed maturity investments over the next few years 
actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses or increase actuarial gains that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity  whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses or decrease actuarial gains that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years 
holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plan are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 
other than temporary impairments we employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all investments 
the methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process ensuring that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  and with respect to equity securities  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery in value 
we apply these factors to all securities 

table of contents we monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  and we consider past events  current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists 
for our impairment review of asset backed fixed maturity securities  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery 
we consider all available information relevant to the collectibility of the security  including information about the remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer  industry analyst reports  sector credit ratings and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows 
when an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security occurs  and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
if we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it  we separate the other than temporary impairment into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
the amount of the estimated other than temporary impairment that is non credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
we estimate the amount of the other than temporary impairment that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security with the net present value of the fixed maturity security s projected future cash flows  discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment 
the non credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the fixed maturity security at the impairment measurement date 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities are recorded as realized losses  which reduce net income and earnings per share 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share  but reduce other comprehensive income  which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future 
see investment portfolio for further discussion regarding other than temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized loss position

actual payments may differ from the contractual and or estimated payments in the table 

table of contents december  in millions maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total long term debt interest associated with long term debt operating lease commitments qualified pension plan funding obligations non qualified pension and post retirement benefit obligations investment commitments loss and lae obligations long term debt includes our senior debentures due in  which pay annual interest at a rate of  and our junior subordinated debentures due in  which pay cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 
payments related to the principal amount for both of these agreements are expected to be made at the end of the respective debt agreements 
we hold two additional junior subordinated debentures  of which one  in the principal amount of million  pays cumulative dividends at an annual rate of until and changes to libor plus through maturity in payment related to the principal amount of this agreement is expected to be made in  therefore  principal and interest associated with this obligation are reflected in the above table based upon this payment assumption 
the other junior subordinated debentures  in the principal amount of million  pay cumulative dividends at an annual rate of on two thirds of the securities  while dividend payments on one third of the securities is based on the three month libor plus 
payment related to the principal amount of this agreement is expected to be made in  therefore  principal and interest associated with this obligation are reflected in the above table based upon this payment assumption 
in addition  we have borrowings under a collateralized borrowing program which pays interest quarterly at a rate of annually 
such borrowings are available for a twenty year term or through september  additionally  our debt includes our surplus notes due in  which pay quarterly interest at a rate of the three month libor plus  subject to a maximum interest rate of until may  payment related to the principal amount of this agreement of million is expected to be made in  subject to the approval of the new york department of insurance  therefore  principal and interest associated with this obligation are reflected in the above table based upon this payment assumption 
our insurance subsidiaries are lessees with a number of operating leases 
qualified pension plan funding obligations represent a payment made in january which  using assumptions  would equate to full funding of the plan based upon estimation of plan liabilities at the time such contribution was made 
additional contributions may be required in the future based on the level of pension assets and liabilities in future periods 
the ultimate payment amount is based on several assumptions  including  but not limited to  the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate for benefit obligations  mortality experience  interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation of benefit obligations 
differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely and will likely result in changes to our funding obligations in future periods 
non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits 
estimates of these payments and the payment patterns are based upon historical experience 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and lae reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and lae reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates based principally on historical experience 
other matters we have a qualified defined benefit pension plan and several non qualified pension plans that were frozen as of january  several factors and assumptions affect the amount of costs associated with the plans and contributions required to be provided to the trust for the qualified plan  including  among others  assumed long term rates of return on plan assets 
to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets 
actual returns that are in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce the net actuarial losses or increase actuarial gains that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity  whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses or decrease actuarial gains that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years 
expenses related to these plans are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year 
our pre tax expense related to our defined benefit plans was million and million for and  respectively 
the assets held by the qualified benefit plan are subject to changing economic conditions see investment portfolio on pages to of this form k 
actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately million of income during  whereas the market decline in resulted in negative returns of approximately million of losses related to our qualified plan 
the benefit from the investment gains experienced in was partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from prior year  and a decrease in the long term return 
table of contents assumption to 
this net gain resulted in adjustments to our net actuarial gains in of approximately million 
this is reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income 
in  we experienced significant investment losses  compounded by a long term return assumption of  which were partially offset by a slightly higher discount rate than that of the prior year 
these net losses resulted in increased actuarial losses as of december  of approximately million  which are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income 
the change in these actuarial gains and losses is amortized in future years 
including the effect of our actual experience in and taking into consideration the million contribution made january   pension related expenses in are expected to be significantly lower than our costs in accordingly  we expect our pre tax pension expense to decrease by approximately million in  from million in to approximately million in during  we contributed million to the plan  of which approximately million was in excess of the minimum contribution required by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
subsequently  on january   and as discussed in liquidity and capital resources on pages to of this form k  we made an additional discretionary contribution of million 
based on current assumptions  this results in our qualified defined benefit plan being essentially fully funded as of the date of such contribution 
accordingly  we do not currently expect to make significant additional contributions to the plan in order to maintain appropriate funding levels in the near term 
however  the ultimate payment amount is based on several assumptions  including  but not limited to  the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate for benefit obligations  mortality experience  interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations 
since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely  changes to our funding obligations in future periods are possible 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial position  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters durand litigation on march   a putative class action suit captioned jennifer a 
durand v 
the hanover insurance group  inc  the allmerica financial cash balance pension plan was filed in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky 
the named plaintiff  a former employee who received a lump sum distribution from our cash balance plan the plan at or about the time of her termination  claims that she and others similarly situated did not receive the appropriate lump sum distribution because in computing the lump sum  we understated the accrued benefit in the calculation 
we filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies  which motion was granted without prejudice in a decision dated november  this decision was reversed by an order dated march  issued by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit  and the case was remanded to the district court 
the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on december  in response  we filed a motion to dismiss on january  in addition to the pending calculation of the lump sum distribution claim  the amended complaint includes a a claim that the plan failed to calculate participants account balances properly because interest credits were based solely upon the performance of each participant s selection from among various hypothetical investment options as the plan provided rather than crediting the greater of that performance or the year treasury rate  b a claim that the plan amendment  which changed interest crediting for all participants from the performance of participant s investment selections to the year treasury rate  reduced benefits in violation of erisa for participants who had account balances as of the amendment date by not continuing to provide them performance based interest crediting on those balances  and c claims for breach of fiduciary duty and erisa notice requirements for not properly informing participants of the various interest crediting and lump sum distribution matters of which plaintiffs complain 
in our judgment  the outcome is not expected to be material to our financial position  although it could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period and on the funding of the plan 
hurricane katrina litigation we have been named as a defendant in various litigation  including putative class actions  relating to disputes arising from damages which occurred as a result of hurricane katrina in as of december   there were approximately such cases 
these cases have been filed in both louisiana state courts and federal district courts 

table of contents these cases generally involve  among other claims  disputes as to the amount of reimbursable claims in particular cases eg how much of the damage to an insured property is attributable to flood and therefore not covered  and how much is attributable to wind  which may be covered  as well as the scope of insurance coverage under homeowners and commercial property policies due to flooding  civil authority actions  loss of landscaping  business interruption and other matters 
certain of these cases claim a breach of duty of good faith or violations of louisiana insurance claims handling laws or regulations and involve claims for punitive or exemplary damages 
on august   the state of louisiana individually and on behalf of the state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development filed a putative class action in the civil district court for the parish of orleans  state of louisiana  entitled state of louisiana  individually and on behalf of state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development ex rel the honorable charles c 
foti  jr  the attorney general for the state of louisiana  individually and as a class action on behalf of all recipients of funds as well as all eligible and or future recipients of funds through the road home program v 
aaa insurance  et al  no 
the complaint named as defendants over foreign and domestic insurance carriers  including us 
plaintiff seeks to represent a class of current and former louisiana citizens who have applied for and received or will receive funds through louisiana s road home program 
on august   plaintiff filed an amended petition in this case  asserting myriad claims  including claims for breach of contract  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  fiduciary duty and louisiana s bad faith statutes 
plaintiff seeks relief in the form of  among other things  declarations that a the efficient proximate cause of losses suffered by putative class members was windstorm  a covered peril under their policies  b the second efficient proximate cause of their losses was storm surge  which plaintiff contends is not excluded under class members policies  c the damage caused by water entering affected parishes of louisiana does not fall within the definition of flood  d the damages caused by water entering orleans parish and the surrounding area was a result of a man made occurrence and are properly covered under class members policies  e many class members suffered total losses to their residences  and f many class members are entitled to recover the full value for their residences stated on their policies pursuant to the louisiana valued policy law 
in accordance with these requested declarations  plaintiff seeks to recover amounts that it alleges should have been paid to policyholders under their insurance agreements  as well as penalties  attorneys fees  and costs 
the case has been removed to the federal district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
on march   the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part a motion to dismiss filed by defendants 
the court dismissed all claims for bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty and all claims for flood damages under policies with flood exclusions or asserted under the valued policy law  but rejected the insurers arguments that the purported assignments from individual claimants to the state were barred by anti assignment provisions in the insurers policies 
on april   the court denied a motion for reconsideration of its ruling regarding the anti assignment provisions  but certified the issue as ripe for immediate appeal 
on april   defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit  which was granted 
defendants appeal is currently pending 
we have established our loss and lae reserves on the assumption that we will not have any liability under the road home or similar litigation  and that we will otherwise prevail in litigation as to the cause of certain large losses and not incur extra contractual or punitive damages 
certain regulatory and industry developments unfavorable economic conditions may contribute to an increase in the number of insurance companies that are under regulatory supervision 
this may result in an increase in mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds  or voluntary payments by solvent insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies 
mandatory assessments  which are subject to statutory limits  can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such future assessments or voluntary payments 
over the past three years  state sponsored insurers  reinsurers and involuntary pools have increased significantly  particularly in those states which have atlantic or gulf coast exposures 
as a result  the potential assessment exposure of insurers doing business in such states and the attendant collection risks have increased  particularly  in our case  in the states of massachusetts  louisiana and florida 
such actions and related regulatory restrictions on rate increases  underwriting and the ability to non renew business may limit our ability to reduce the potential exposure to hurricane related losses 
at this time  we are unable to predict the likelihood or impact of any such potential assessments or other actions 
in february  the governor of michigan called upon every automobile insurer operating in the state to freeze personal automobile insurance rates for months 
table of contents to allow time for the legislature to enact comprehensive automobile insurance reform 
in addition  she endorsed a number of proposals by her appointed automobile and home insurance consumer advocate which would  among other things  change the current rate approval process from the current file and use system to prior approval  mandate affordable rates  eliminate territorial ratings  reduce the threshold for lawsuits to be filed in at fault incidents  and prohibit the use of certain underwriting criteria such as credit based insurance scores 
the michigan legislature is currently considering these and other proposals  including one to require insurance companies to offer low cost personal automobile prices 
the office of financial and insurance regulation ofir had previously issued regulations prohibiting the use of credit scores to rate personal lines insurance policies  which regulations are the subject of litigation being reviewed by the michigan supreme court 
oral arguments were held before the supreme court on october  pending a determination by the michigan supreme court  ofir is enjoined from disapproving rates on the basis that they are based in part on credit based insurance scores 
on november   the michigan board of canvassers issued preliminary approval allowing proponents to begin collecting signatures as the first step in placing a ballot initiative in front of voters in november the proposed ballot question would require a number of changes for the property and casualty market  including  subject to certain limitations  the rollback of rates by up to for all lines with the exception of workers compensation and surety  and an additional rollback of personal automobile rates for good drivers 
proponents must present over  valid signatures by late may at this time  we are unable to predict the likelihood of adoption or impact on our business of any such proposals or regulations  but any such restrictions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  proposals have been made to establish a federal based insurance regulatory system and to allow insurers to elect either federal or state based regulation optional federal chartering 
in light of the current economic crisis and the focus on increased regulatory controls  particularly with regard to financial institutions  there has been renewed interest in such proposals 
in fact  several proposals have been introduced to create a system of optional federal chartering  to create federal oversight mechanisms for insurance or insurance holding companies which are systemically important to the united states financial system and to create a national office to monitor insurance companies 
we cannot predict the impact that any such change will have on our operations or business or on that of our competitors 
other matters we have been named a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
in addition  we are involved  from time to time  in examinations  investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies 
the potential outcome of any such action or regulatory proceedings in which we have been named a defendant or the subject of an inquiry or investigation  and our ultimate liability  if any  from such action or regulatory proceedings  is difficult to predict at this time 
in our opinion  based on the advice of legal counsel  the ultimate resolutions of such proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  although they could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
residual markets we are required to participate in residual markets in various states  which generally pertain to high risk insureds  disrupted markets or lines of business or geographic areas where rates are regarded as excessive

rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security
