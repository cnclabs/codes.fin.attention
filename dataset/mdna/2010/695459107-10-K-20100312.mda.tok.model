item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview paetec is a competitive communications services and solutions provider guided by the principle that delivering superior customer service is the key to competing successfully with other communications services providers 
paetec s primary business is providing large  medium sized and  to a lesser extent  small business end user customers in metropolitan areas with a package of integrated communications services that encompasses data services  including broadband internet access services and virtual private network services  and voice services  including local telephone services and domestic and international long distance services 
paetec holding had approximately  employess as of march  as of the same date  paetec holding had in service  digital t transmission lines  which represented the equivalent of  access lines  for approximately  business customers in a service area encompassing of the top metropolitan statistical areas 
business acquisitions to supplement its internal growth  paetec has pursued an acquisition strategy that has sought acquisition candidates that fulfill one or more of the following objectives to increase its penetration of existing markets  to expand into new markets  to augment the geographic scope of its network fiber based assets  primarily in high density markets  and to enhance its ability to sell and deliver value added services 
indebtedness to fund its expansion through acquisitions  which began in february with the us lec merger and included the acquisition of mcleodusa in february  paetec has increased its borrowings under a variety of debt arrangements 
in connection with its acquisition of us lec in  paetec obtained million principal amount of new senior secured credit facilities on february  and applied the proceeds of the facilities primarily to refinance or retire substantially all of the indebtedness of the two companies and to repurchase us lec s outstanding preferred stock 
in july  paetec amended its senior secured credit facilities and prepaid million principal amount of borrowings under those facilities with the proceeds of an offering of principal amount of its senior notes due and cash on hand 
in january  paetec obtained million principal amount of additional term loans under an incremental facility extended pursuant to its existing credit facilities agreement and applied a portion of the borrowings under that facility toward the redemption of all of mcleodusa s outstanding senior secured notes in connection with paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
in october  in consideration of  among other matters  the adverse conditions in the credit markets and uncertainties concerning the timetable for a recovery of those markets  paetec obtained million principal amount of revolving loans by a drawdown under its existing revolving credit facility 
paetec used the proceeds of the revolving loans for capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
during  paetec paid down million in aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents in june  to strengthen its financial position  paetec prepaid million principal amount of borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities with the proceeds of an offering of million principal amount of its senior secured notes due and cash on hand 
in january  paetec prepaid the remaining million principal amount of borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities with the proceeds of an additional offering of million principal amount of its senior secured notes due as a result of the two offerings  paetec eliminated its outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities and extended its debt maturities to and with limited impact to its cash flow generation capabilities 
trends affecting our business general economic slowdown 
adverse conditions in the economy  which have significantly reduced the availability of corporate credit  are continuing to affect the global financial system and equity markets 
these conditions and other factors have contributed to a slowdown of business activity across a broad range of industries 
paetec believes that the financial and economic pressures faced by its business customers in this environment of diminished consumer spending  corporate downsizing and tightened credit have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on billable minutes of use and on customer attrition rates  and have resulted in and may continue to result in increased customer demands for price reductions in connection with contract renewals 
in addition  as a result of the current conditions  paetec s ability to access further the debt and equity markets may be restricted at a time when it would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an adverse effect on paetec s flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on the market value of paetec s common stock  which could make it more difficult or costly for the company to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities 
shifting patterns of use and convergence of technology 
as telecommunications customers increasingly use wireless forms of communication  such as hand held internet access devices and cell phones  the volume of traffic carried by traditional wireline telecommunications networks has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
although paetec believes this trend is most pronounced in the residential marketplace  wireless substitution also has had an adverse effect on the wireline usage patterns of the medium sized and large businesses and institutions paetec targets 
paetec believes that wireless substitution has led to a decrease in the average minutes of use generated by its customers 
to date  paetec has been able partially to offset this loss of revenue from existing customers through sales of services to new customers 
paetec believes that the transition to wireless based forms of communication will continue in the foreseeable future 
paetec seeks to respond to this trend by offering service levels and product packages that are not currently available using wireless alternatives 
voice and data traffic historically have traveled over telecommunications networks using incompatible transmission formats 
this means that a telecommunications transmission circuit had to be designated to carry either data traffic or voice traffic 
as a result  excess capacity on a voice circuit could not be made available to reduce demand on a data circuit 
voip technology  which allows voice and data traffic to travel interchangeably over the same network  enables more efficient use of the telecommunications networks 
because paetec leases the majority of its transmission capacity  this increased efficiency has the potential to reduce significantly paetec s cost of providing services to its customers 
paetec continues to install equipment and transition its network to take advantage of these new technologies 
paetec believes that  in operating a network using both traditional voice and newer voip technology  it is one of the leading competitive carriers in pursuing the benefits of technological convergence 
the combination of shifting patterns of use and increasing convergence of voice and data traffic could make it harder for paetec to sustain and improve its operating margins over the next several years 
paetec believes that the challenges these trends may present will be offset in part by the efficiencies of operating a data network to which it will increasingly transition its traditional voice services 

table of contents recent growth of paetec 
paetec primarily targets large  medium sized and  to a lesser extent  small business end user customers in providing a package of integrated communications services 
over the course of its recent merger transactions  paetec has acquired some customers and products that would not be considered consistent with paetec s traditional operating focus 
as paetec looks to increase its operating leverage  management anticipates that the company may choose not to enhance offerings to some customers or renew some customer relationships 
such actions may impact the rate of our future revenue growth compared to historical trends 
competition  evolving regulatory environment  industry consolidation 
the telecommunications industry has remained highly competitive in an environment marked by increased deregulation 
market forces and changes in government regulations have required  and may continue to require  paetec to reduce rates for some of the services it provides 
these trends may reduce paetec s historical rate of revenue growth and continue to exert pressure on its operating margins 
paetec believes that the relatively long term nature of its agreements with customers of its network services  which as of march  have an average initial term of months  should reduce the likelihood that it will experience significant  rapid decreases in the rates it charge for its services 
mergers involving the rbocs and deregulatory activity favoring rbocs at both federal and state levels over the past several years have made it more difficult to compete against these larger  financially stronger competitors 
additional regulatory changes that would permit incumbent carriers to materially increase rates charged for accessing last mile connections or reduce paetec s rates for certain network services could make it more difficult for our company to remain competitive 
paetec s industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation in recent periods 
merger and acquisition transactions have created more significant competitors for paetec and have reduced the number of vendors from which paetec may purchase network elements it leverages to operate its business 
paetec expects this trend to continue in the near future 
to compete more effectively in its industry  paetec plans to continue pursuing its historical acquisition strategy to increase its operating leverage  achieve economies of scale and broaden its name recognition 
financial difficulties faced by many competitive communications carriers 
over the last seven years  many competitive communications services providers have experienced financial difficulties 
these difficulties have led to the general perception that the competitive carrier sector of paetec s industry is marred by instability and financial weakness 
this perception makes it harder for paetec to gain new customers  raise additional capital and negotiate with vendors 
paetec has addressed this perception by maintaining cash balances that are generally in excess of its current needs and by limiting its growth activities so that its short term cash flow is not impaired 
revenue paetec derives revenue from sales of its network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services 
paetec derives most of its revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees that are generated principally by sales of its network services 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
paetec primarily bills monthly recurring fees in advance 
usage based fees consist of fees paid by paetec s network services customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when paetec terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by other carriers for long distance calls paetec originates or terminates for those carriers 

table of contents the monthly recurring fees and usage based fees generated by sales of paetec s network services to end users and carrier services to any customer tend to be relatively consistent from month to month  subject to changes in the calling patterns of the customer s business 
these fees generally are based on the number of digital t transmission lines used by the customer 
because paetec believes that the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines in service provides accurate information with respect to its revenue prospects  the company uses data with respect to the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines paetec has in service from period to period to assist it in evaluating revenue trends related to its network services and carrier services businesses 
network services 
paetec delivers integrated communications services  including data and internet services  local services and long distance services  to end users on a retail basis  which the company refers to as its network services 
paetec s core network services are those that generate revenue from retail enterprise customers to which paetec delivers such integrated communications services on primarily tl or larger access lines  which excludes access fee and reciprocal compensation fee revenue related to network services and revenue from the company s non core plain old telephone service  or pots  operations 
pots operations involve the provision of basic telephone services supplying standard single line telephones  telephone lines and access to the public switched network 
paetec s network services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
in addition to usage based fees invoiced directly to the end user customers  usage based fees for paetec s network services include the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s network services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates non toll calls originated by customers of other carriers 
paetec recognizes revenue during the period in which the revenue is earned 
paetec s network services also generate non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues  which it receives upon initiation of service 
paetec defers recognition of these revenues and amortizes them over the average customer life 
carrier services 
paetec generates revenue from wholesale sales of communications services to other communications businesses  which the company refers to as its carrier services 
paetec s core carrier services are those that generate revenue from other communications providers  which excludes access fee and reciprocal compensation fee revenue related to carrier services and revenue from the company s non core pots operations 
paetec s carrier services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
usage based fees for paetec s carrier services consist primarily of the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s carrier services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates to its carrier services customers local calls made by customers of other local carriers 
access fee and reciprocal compensation revenue generated by network services and carrier services 
paetec generates access fees when paetec s switching facilities provide a connection between a long distance carrier and an end user 
in accordance with a may order by the fcc  paetec has designed its interstate access rates to equal the interstate access rates charged by the competing incumbent carrier for functionally equivalent access services  including all applicable fixed and traffic sensitive charges 
in the may order  the fcc announced a new rule that limits the interstate access fees competitive carriers like paetec are able to collect from a long distance carrier in situations where the competitive carriers do not provide service directly to the end user 
this rule specifically targeted traffic that competitive carriers handle for wireless carriers and provided that competitive carriers could charge no more than incumbent carriers for these services 

table of contents state regulatory commissions historically have regulated the intrastate access rates imposed by incumbent carriers  but many states had subjected the intrastate access rates of competitive carriers to significantly less regulation 
some states in paetec s geographic markets also require a competitive carrier to mirror the intrastate access rates of the incumbent carrier in that state or interstate rate levels 
in  california and virginia adopted requirements requiring competitive carriers progressively to reduce their intrastate access rates over a limited period 
in  massachusetts required competitive local exchange carriers to mirror the intrastate access rates of the incumbent local exchange carrier effective as of june unless a competitive local exchange carrier could justify higher cost based access rates 
also in  michigan adopted legislation requiring competitive carriers to reduce intrastate rates to interstate rate levels over the next five years 
in january  new jersey ordered all local exchange carriers  including competitive carriers  to transition to interstate rate levels over months 
other state regulatory commissions have begun proceedings to investigate intrastate access rates of competitive carriers 
those proceedings may result in a change to the intrastate rates paetec assesses long distance carriers for use of the company s in state networks 
further  if enacted  legislation pending in some states would require state agencies to order reductions in competitive carrier access charges 
both the fcc and state regulatory commissions continue to review rules regarding the compensation local carriers pay to other local carriers for termination of local telephone calls as reciprocal compensation 
rates and terms for reciprocal compensation are based on agreements between paetec and other local carriers and are supported by federal and state regulatory and judicial rulings 
the company is engaged in continuing discussions with large incumbent carriers  among others  to perpetuate its contractual arrangements for reciprocal compensation in relevant service territories 
paetec has agreements in place with an increasing number of other local providers  including qwest in its region  that require such termination services to be provided on a bill and keep basis in which neither carrier charges the other for terminating local calls 
all forms of intercarrier compensation  including exchange access and reciprocal compensation  currently are the subject of a generic proceeding at the fcc designed to reform the way carriers and providers pay other carriers and providers for use of their respective networks 
integrated solutions 
paetec derives revenue from sales to retail end user customers of telecommunications equipment and software and related services  which the company refers to as its integrated solutions 
a portion of paetec s integrated solutions revenue consists of fees its customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes revenue for equipment sales and system design and installation services upon delivery and acceptance of the underlying equipment 
paetec derives an additional component of its integrated solutions revenue by selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery of the software 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of that software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees on a pro rata basis over the length of the underlying maintenance contract and training fees after it fulfills the training obligation 
cost of sales paetec provides its network services and carrier services by using electronic network components that it owns and telephone and data transmission lines that it leases from other telecommunications carriers 
paetec s cost of sales for these services consists primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
paetec s leased transport charges are the payments it makes to lease the telephone and data transmission lines  which the company uses to connect its customers to its network and to connect its network to the networks of other carriers 
usage costs for local and long distance are the costs that paetec incurs for calls made by its customers 
cost of sales for paetec s integrated solutions includes the costs it incurs in designing systems and purchasing and installing equipment 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses paetec s selling  general and administrative expenses include selling and marketing  customer service  billing  corporate administration  engineering personnel and other personnel costs 
impairment charge paetec assesses the carrying value of its goodwill annually or as events or circumstances change 
in accordance with its impairment assessment process  paetec recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on a preliminary assessment in that quarter  and recorded an additional non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of based on the finalization of that preliminary assessment 
the goodwill impairment charges were attributable to weaker economic conditions in paetec s markets 
for more information about paetec s impairment review policies  see critical accounting policies below 
there was no change in goodwill during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization include depreciation of paetec s telecommunications network and equipment  computer hardware and purchased software  office equipment  furniture and fixtures  and buildings  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
debt extinguishment and related costs paetec s debt extinguishment and related costs include expenses related to the repayment of outstanding term loans under paetec s senior secured credit facilities  costs incurred related to the reduction of the notional amount of its swap agreement in effect as of june   and the reclassification into earnings of derivative losses previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss  due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting treatment of paetec s swap agreement in effect as of december  interest expense interest expense includes interest due on borrowings under paetec s senior secured credit facilities  the senior notes due and the senior secured notes due  amortization of debt issuance costs  debt discounts  and interest due on paetec s capital lease obligations and other debt 
other income  net other income  net includes non monetary gains on the exchange of reciprocal indefeasible rights of use  or irus  investment income  and other financing income 
accounting for income taxes paetec recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events 
under this method  paetec determines deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
if necessary  paetec reduces deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance to an amount that it determines is more likely than not to be recoverable 
paetec makes significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation paetec s employees participate in a variety of equity incentive plans 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the 
table of contents financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
adjusted ebitda presentation adjusted ebitda  as defined by paetec for the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis  represents net loss income before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  provision for benefit from income taxes  stock based compensation  sales and use tax settlement  impairment charge  integration and separation costs  gain on non monetary transaction  debt extinguishment and related costs  leveraged recapitalization related costs  and change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
paetec s adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
this non gaap financial measure is used by paetec s management  together with financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap such as net loss income and revenue  to assess paetec s historical and prospective operating performance 
management uses adjusted ebitda to enhance its understanding of paetec s core operating performance  which represents management s views concerning paetec s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
management historically has found it helpful  and believes that investors have found it helpful  to consider an operating measure that excludes expenses  such as integration and separation costs  debt extinguishment and related costs  and impairment charges  relating to transactions not reflective of paetec s core operations 
in the future  the company expects that it may again report adjusted ebitda excluding the items discussed below and may incur expenses similar to the excluded items discussed below 
accordingly  the exclusion of these and other similar items in paetec s non gaap presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non recurring  infrequent or unusual 
management believes that  for the reasons discussed below  paetec s use of a supplemental financial measure which excludes these expenses facilitates an assessment of paetec s fundamental operating trends and addresses concerns of management and of paetec s investors that these expenses may obscure such underlying trends 
management notes that each of these expenses is presented in paetec s financial statements and discussed in the management s discussion and analysis section of paetec s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  so that investors have complete information about the expenses 
the information about paetec s core operating performance provided by this financial measure is used by management for a variety of purposes 
management regularly communicates its adjusted ebitda results to its board of directors and discusses with the board management s interpretation of such results 
management also compares the company s adjusted ebitda performance against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash bonus compensation for executives and other employees  largely because management feels that this measure is indicative of the how the fundamental business is performing and is being managed 
in addition  paetec s management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate paetec s performance relative to that of its competitors 
this financial measure permits a comparative assessment of paetec s operating performance relative to the company s performance based on its gaap results  while isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is a particularly useful comparative measure within paetec s industry 
the communications industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings 
these activities have led to significant charges to earnings  such as those resulting from integration costs and debt restructurings  and to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
adjusted ebitda facilitates company to company comparisons in the communications industry by eliminating some of the foregoing 
table of contents variations 
management believes that because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining both stock based compensation and stock based compensation expense among companies and from period to period  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding stock based compensation from adjusted ebitda enhances company to company comparisons over multiple fiscal periods 
by permitting investors to review both the gaap and non gaap measures  paetec and its peers that customarily use similar non gaap measures facilitate an enhanced understanding of historical financial results and enable investors to make more meaningful company to company comparisons 
paetec also provides information relating to its adjusted ebitda so that analysts  investors and other interested persons have the same data that management uses to assess paetec s core operating performance 
management believes that adjusted ebitda should be viewed only as a supplement to the gaap financial information 
management also believes  however  that providing this information in addition to  and together with  gaap financial information permits the foregoing persons to obtain a better understanding of paetec s core operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance on a standalone and a comparative basis 
paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
in addition  adjusted ebitda has other limitations as an analytical financial measure 
these limitations include the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect paetec s capital expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  associated with paetec s indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cost of equity awards to employees  adjusted ebitda excludes some items in addition to stock based compensation that are likely to recur  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that paetec s management considers not indicative of paetec s ongoing operations  and to the extent that paetec changes its accounting of certain transactions or other items from period to period  paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable from period to period 
paetec s management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on paetec s gaap results to evaluate its operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in adjusted ebitda 
management also compensates for these limitations by providing gaap based disclosures concerning the excluded items in its financial disclosures 
as a result of these limitations  however  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net loss income  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of operating performance  or as an alternative to any other gaap measure of operating performance 
results of operations the following table presents selected operating data for the fiscal years ended december   and the comparison of paetec s operating results for to paetec s operating results for is materially affected by the acquisition by paetec holding corp

paetec believes that the decrease also reflected in part adverse economic conditions in paetec s markets that have contributed to usage related pressure experienced by the carrier services business 
the carrier services business also experienced a loss of some wireless customers  which paetec believes is primarily due to continuing consolidation in the wireless communications industry 
revenue from integrated solutions services increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in revenue generated by the integrated solutions business  which has a longer revenue cycle causing irregular trends on a quarterly basis  was attributable to growth in equipment sales

paetec recognized a million benefit recorded as a sales and use tax settlement in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income during the year ended december  as a result of settlement agreements entered into with the iowa department of revenue 
these assessments  including estimated interest and penalties  originally amounted to approximately million 
paetec entered into settlement agreements with the iowa department of revenue in april and january  resolving a substantial portion of the disputed assessments 
see legal proceedings for more information

debt extinguishment and related costs 
during  paetec recognized a total of million of debt extinguishment and related costs 
in connection with the june issuance of its senior secured notes due  paetec recognized million of debt extinguishment and related costs  which reflected the elimination of million of debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount related to the repayment of 
table of contents approximately million of outstanding term loans under the company s existing senior secured credit facilities and million of costs incurred related to the reduction of the notional amount of its swap agreement in effect as of june  from million to million

paetec s average outstanding debt balances increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of the million principal amount of loans paetec obtained in october under its revolving credit facility and also as a result of paetec s issuance in june of its senior secured notes and application of the note proceeds to repay outstanding credit facility term loans 
interest expense increased slightly to million for from million for  as the effect of higher debt levels and paetec s issuance in june of its senior secured notes was offset by a decline in the weighted average annual borrowing rates under paetec s credit facilities and its notes to for from for income taxes 
paetec recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december   which represented an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to a million tax charge to establish the valuation allowance on net operating losses generated in the current year  and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
paetec recorded a tax provision of million for  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to a million non deductible goodwill impairment charge  a million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance  and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
deferred income tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities  including net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  for financial and tax reporting

a valuation allowance is established for any deferred income tax asset for which realization is uncertain 
paetec considers all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income and recent financial operations  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
in evaluating the objective evidence provided by historical results  paetec considered the past three years of combined results on a pro forma basis that included the results of mcleodusa and of us lec beginning on january  based on an assessment of the available positive and negative evidence  including the historical pro forma combined results  paetec determined that there are uncertainties relative to its ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets 
in recognition of these uncertainties  paetec has provided a valuation allowance of million on the net deferred income tax assets as of december  a valuation allowance of million existed on the net deferred income tax assets as of december   resulting in a net decrease of million in the year ended december   of which million represents a charge to income tax expense and the offsetting million decrease to equity 
paetec will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future and if it is determined that its deferred tax assets are realizable  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be reflected 

table of contents upon the january  adoption of asc  business combinations  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after an acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense  including charges and uncertainties associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of asc as of december   paetec had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million  including approximately million of nol carryforwards acquired as part of the february  merger with mcleod 
paetec has recorded a deferred income tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of federal and state loss carryforwards 
if unused  the nol carryforwards would expire on various dates from through in recognition of the uncertainties relative to the utilization of the federal nols  a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
included in the nol carryforward deferred tax asset above is approximately million of deferred tax assets attributable to state nols 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state nol carryforwards will not be realized prior to their expiration 
in recognition of this uncertainty  paetec has provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards 
as a result of the realization requirements of asc  compensation stock compensation  paetec s deferred tax assets at december  do not include approximately million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of paetec s nol carryforwards 
equity will be increased by approximately million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized for federal income tax purposes 
paetec uses ordering pursuant asc  income taxes  for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized 
asc also provides guidance to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold  which income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc requires expanded annual disclosures  including a rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific information related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions  including interest  at december  was million  the majority of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to  million for from  million for  principally because of the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for the majority of of total revenue for  revenue from network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services accounted for  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for revenue from network services increased million  or  to  million for from million for for  revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees accounted for and  respectively  of revenue from network services  compared to and  respectively  of such revenue for the increase in network services revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december   of which mcleodusa accounted for  lines  as well as from increased revenue from application services and network security products 
growth of the network services business was constrained by fewer than expected billable minutes of use  increased pricing pressure  and an increase in customer attrition rates 

table of contents revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in carrier services revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service  as well as growth of new integrated t services and multi site vpn sales 
for  revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees accounted for and  respectively  of revenue from carrier services  compared to and  respectively  of such revenue for the increase in monthly recurring fees as a percentage of total carrier services revenue was primarily attributable to the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of  as monthly recurring fees historically have represented a higher percentage of total carrier services revenue of mcleodusa s business than of paetec s business 
access fee revenue represented of carrier services usage based fees for and of carrier services usage based fees for reciprocal compensation constituted of carrier services usage based fees for and of carrier services usage based fees for the decrease in access fees and reciprocal compensation as a percentage of carrier services usage based fees was principally attributable to a shift in product mix toward ip based and other services that do not generate as much or any access fee revenue or reciprocal compensation for paetec 
paetec believes that the decrease also reflected in part adverse economic conditions in paetec s markets that have contributed to usage related pressure experienced by the carrier services business 
the carrier services business also experienced a loss of some wireless customers  which paetec believes is primarily due to consolidation in the wireless communications industry 
revenue from integrated solutions services increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in revenue generated by the integrated solutions business  which has a longer revenue cycle causing irregular trends on a quarterly basis  is partly attributable to paetec s acquisition of allworx corp 
during the fourth quarter of the operations of allworx corp 
contributed million to integrated solutions revenue for cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for  in part because of the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of in each period  cost of sales consisted primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the decrease as a percentage of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the inclusion of mcleodusa s results  which reflect charges based on a broader facilities based owned network  for the majority of usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates paetec is charged by network providers 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from for to for this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the results of us lec and allworx corp 
for the full period and the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of cost of sales as a percentage of revenue historically has been higher for the acquired companies than for paetec 
the increase in cost of sales also reflected the costs associated with an increase in equipment sales  an upgrade in paetec s southeast data network  and an increase in lower margin wholesale traffic 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
the acquisition contributed to an increase in salaries  wages  commissions and benefits of million  of which million was due to an increase in the total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   and million was due to an increase in sales commissions paid to paetec s sales force for their contribution to the increase in total revenue 
an increase in facilities expense necessary to support the broader network infrastructure after the 
table of contents mcleodusa acquisition also contributed to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to for from for impairment charge 
as discussed above under overview  paetec determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million in the third quarter of based on a preliminary assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  management finalized the assessment and recorded an additional non cash charge of million 
integration and separation costs 
paetec recorded million of integration and separation costs in in connection with the mcleodusa merger  paetec incurred integration costs of approximately million in  primarily related to costs associated with employee separations 
paetec also incurred approximately million of separation costs as a result of the involuntary employee separations announced in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december   largely as a result of property and equipment obtained in the acquisition of mcleodusa and as part of paetec s network deployment and maintenance 
the increase was also partly attributable to the write up of intangible assets associated with the us lec  mcleodusa  and allworx corp 
acquisitions 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was offset in part as paetec ceased to record depreciation on some of its older equipment that had reached the end of its useful life 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  due to the higher average outstanding debt balances during that resulted from the million principal amount of senior notes paetec issued in july  the million incremental term loan facility paetec obtained in january  and the million principal amount of revolving loans paetec obtained in october the average outstanding debt balances were million for and million for as of december  and  borrowing rates under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes averaged and  respectively 
income taxes 
paetec recorded a tax provision of million for  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to the million non deductible goodwill impairment charge discussed above  a million tax charge to establish the valuation allowance described below  and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
based on an assessment of the available positive and negative evidence  including the historical pro forma combined results  paetec determined that there are uncertainties relative to its ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets 
in recognition of these uncertainties  paetec provided a valuation allowance of million on the net deferred income tax assets as of december  a valuation allowance of million existed on the net deferred income tax assets as of december   resulting in an increase of million in  of which million represents a charge to income tax expense and million represents a charge to goodwill or equity as it relates primarily to purchase accounting for the mcleodusa acquisition 
if paetec were to determine that it could realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  it would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance 
paetec acquired approximately billion of nols pursuant to the mcleodusa acquisition 
section of the internal revenue code of  or irc section  places annual limitations on the use of some tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the time of an ownership change 
as a result of the acquisition  mcleodusa experienced an ownership change within the meaning of irc section paetec has determined that the acquired nols will be subject to substantial limitations under irc section as a result of the ownership change 

table of contents as of december   paetec had a deferred tax asset for federal nol carryforwards of approximately million  including the approximately million of nol carryforwards acquired as part of the mcleodusa acquisition 
paetec recorded a deferred income tax asset of approximately million that reflected the benefit of federal and state loss carryforwards as of december  included in the nol carryforward deferred tax asset above is approximately million of deferred tax assets attributable to state nols 
approximately million of this deferred tax asset relates to nols acquired pursuant to the mcleodusa acquisition 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some state nol carryforwards will not be realized before their expiration 
in recognition of this risk  as of december  paetec provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards 
as a result of some realization requirements of asc  paetec s deferred tax assets at december  do not include approximately million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of the company s nol carryovers 
on january   paetec adopted the provisions of asc relating to uncertain tax positions  and recorded a reduction of retained earnings of million effective january  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions at december  was million  the majority of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies paetec s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require paetec to make estimates and assumptions 
of paetec s significant accounting policies described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  paetec believes that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
paetec generates recurring operating revenue pursuant to contracts with paetec s customers and non recurring revenue pursuant to non recurring agreements 
paetec recognizes revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require satisfaction of the following four basic criteria before revenue can be recognized there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
paetec bases its determination of the third and fourth criteria above on the company s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee it has charged for the services rendered and products delivered  and the prospects that those fees will be collected 
if changes in conditions should cause it to determine that these criteria likely will not be met for some future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
management makes estimates of future customer credits through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
the provisions for revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue when incurred 
since any revenue allowances are recorded as an offset to revenue  any future increases or decreases in the allowances will positively or negatively affect revenue by the same amount 
network services and carrier services revenue 
paetec derives revenue primarily from its sale of communications services 
paetec s service revenue consists principally of usage fees and monthly recurring fees 

table of contents usage fees consist of fees paid by paetec s customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when the company terminates non toll calls originated by their customers  and access fees paid by carriers for long distance calls that paetec originates and terminates 
paetec recognizes revenue related to usage fees when the service is provided 
paetec bills usage fees in arrears and uses estimates to recognize revenue for unbilled usage fees 
paetec s ability to generate reciprocal compensation revenue and access revenue is subject to numerous regulatory and legal proceedings 
until these proceedings are ultimately resolved  paetec s policy is to recognize reciprocal compensation and access revenue only when it concludes that its realization of that revenue is reasonably assured 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
paetec recognizes this revenue during the period in which it is earned 
paetec has arrangements where it recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition services  which requires some non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues that are payable in advance of the provision of services to be deferred over the average customer life 
in accordance with those guidelines  paetec defers service activation and installation fee revenues and related costs and amortizes them over the average customer life  which is primarily three years 
the revenue from indefeasible rights to use fiber optic telecommunications network facilities is recognized over the term of the related lease unless it qualifies as a sales type lease  for which revenue is recognized at the time the sale criteria in asc  real estate retail land  are met 
base annual revenue for telecommunications network maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
additional services provided under these contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
integrated solutions revenue 
paetec also derives revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment and software 
equipment revenue consists of fees paetec s customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes equipment revenue upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment 
paetec derives software revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery and acceptance of the software in accordance with asc  software 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees pro rata over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after the training obligation has been fulfilled 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
to determine its allowance for bad debts  paetec uses estimates based on the company s historical collection experience  its assessment of current industry and economic trends  customer concentrations and its credit policies 
as of december   paetec had reserved for million of bad debts 
paetec has reserved for expected bad debt losses based on the factors referred to above  and believes that its reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the sufficiency of paetec s estimates could become materially inadequate as the composition of paetec s receivables changes over time 
paetec continually reviews and refines the estimation process to take account of these changes  but from time to time the company may need to adjust its estimate to reflect actual experience 
cost of sales 
costs of sales are composed primarily of network costs  which are costs incurred for leased transport charges and for transmission of voice and data services over other carriers networks 
these costs consist of both fixed payments and variable amounts based on actual usage and negotiated or regulated contract rates 
paetec expenses network costs as incurred 
these costs include paetec s estimate of charges for which it has not yet received bills  and are based upon the estimated number of transmission lines and facilities 
table of contents paetec has in service and its estimated minutes of use based on internal reports 
once paetec receives an invoice from a carrier  the company begins a process of reconciling that carrier s invoice to paetec s internal reports 
once the reconciliation is complete  paetec follows contractual terms to dispute any erroneous billing and  ultimately  agrees with the carrier on the final amount due 
in some cases  this reconciliation process can take several months to complete 
paetec may make subsequent adjustments to its estimates after it receives bills for the actual costs it incurs  but paetec generally does not expect that these adjustments will be material to its operating results 
accordingly  paetec s accrual for network costs includes estimates for which the reconciliation of the carriers invoices to paetec s internal reports has not been completed 
because of the significance of access costs  the complexity of the systems that capture accrual information  and the quantity of negotiated and regulated rates  paetec believes that the estimation of network cost accruals is a critical accounting policy 
as of december  and  paetec had million and million  respectively  of disputed network invoices and approximately million and million  respectively  of recorded reserves related to disputed balances recorded in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets 
it is paetec s policy to review its long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant under performance of paetec s assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which paetec uses its assets or significant changes in paetec s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in fair market value of paetec s common stock for a sustained period 
paetec determines whether the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property and equipment  and finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the foregoing or other indicators of impairment 
paetec determines if impairment exists relating to long lived assets by comparing future undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  paetec measures the impairment as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
because of the significance of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets and the judgments and estimates that go into the fair value analysis  paetec believes that its policies regarding impairment are critical 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  paetec does not amortize goodwill or other acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
paetec has identified four reporting units as defined in asc there were no changes in allocation of reporting unit goodwill during  or as of december  and  paetec had million of goodwill  with the telecommunications reporting unit accounting for approximately of the goodwill 
as of december  and  paetec had million of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually using a two step impairment test 
step one of the test is used to identify whether or not impairment may exist 
in step one  paetec compares the fair value of each individual reporting unit with its carrying amount 
paetec estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on the income approach  using a discounted projection of future cash flows  supported with a market based valuation 
the income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows that take into account assumed growth rates  price increases  profitability margins  capital expenditures  benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies  and an appropriate discount rate 
paetec s estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other factors  economic conditions  changes to paetec s business model or changes in operating performance 
significant 
table of contents differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect paetec s future financial results 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment may exist 
step two of the impairment test must then be performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment potentially exists when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying value 
asc requires paetec to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if paetec had acquired those reporting units 
specifically  paetec allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities of that reporting unit  in a hypothetical calculation that yields the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
paetec assesses the carrying value of its goodwill during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the annual assessment of the carrying value of paetec s reporting units undertaken with respect to  and indicated that goodwill was not impaired as of july   and  respectively 
in accordance with asc  goodwill of a reporting unit will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if a triggering event occurs  as defined by asc  that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
during the third quarter of  paetec experienced a significant decline in market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the market price of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market 
the decline in market capitalization occurred after paetec s announcement in august that its operating results for the second quarter of would be lower than expected 
some factors contributing to this performance below expectations included less robust billable minutes of use  an increase in customer attrition rates  and continued pricing pressures resulting from competitive product offerings and customer demands for price reductions in connection with contract renewals 
paetec determined that these factors combined with the overall general decline in the economy and financial markets were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required pursuant to asc as a result  paetec completed step one of the impairment process and concluded that the fair values of some of its reporting units were less than the carrying values 
for those reporting units whose fair values were less than the carrying values  paetec conducted step two of the impairment process and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill was less than the carrying value and concluded that goodwill was impaired 
paetec recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on a preliminary assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  management finalized the assessment in connection with the preparation of the company s audited financial statements and recorded an additional non cash charge of million 
approximately of the goodwill impairment charge was attributed to the telecommunications reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  paetec s market capitalization declined further as a result of a decrease in the market price of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market from the market price at september  paetec determined that the continued decline in market capitalization and the continuation of the factors that were identified during the third quarter of were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was again required pursuant to asc for the fourth quarter of as a result  paetec completed step one of the impairment process and concluded that the fair values of its reporting units exceeded the carrying values and therefore recorded no impairment 
the changes in the carrying value of goodwill from january  through december  were as follows in thousands balance as of january  goodwill related to the acquisition of mcleodusa incorporated goodwill related to other acquisitions impairment charge balance as of december  and december  there was no change in goodwill during the twelve months ended december  
table of contents share based payment 
employees of paetec participate in various equity incentive plans 
in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  paetec measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs ratably over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions regarding expected volatilities based on historical experience 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as exercisability of the award  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the us treasury yield curve  and is based on the expected term of the option 
paetec uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and paetec uses different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  paetec is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if paetec s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount recorded by paetec in the current period 
income taxes 
paetec accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the asset and liability approach underlying asc requires the recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
management provides valuation allowances against the net deferred income tax asset for amounts that are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
paetec must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
paetec considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
paetec uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
purchase accounting 
paetec accounts for the purchase of a business by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets 
paetec uses available information to make these fair value determinations and  when necessary  engages an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
because of the inherent subjectivity associated with estimating the fair value of long lived assets  paetec believes that the recording of assets and liabilities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of a business is a critical accounting policy 
derivatives 
asc  derivatives and hedging  allows the gains and losses of a derivative to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  and requires paetec formally to document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
paetec s freestanding derivative instruments are designated as hedges at inception and evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly throughout the hedge period 
these derivatives are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows to be 
table of contents received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
paetec formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
paetec discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative or hedged item expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that it is no longer appropriate to designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
legal and contingency reserves 
paetec accounts for legal and other contingencies in accordance with asc  contingencies 
loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met information before issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the foregoing list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of paetec s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for paetec to judge their application 
there are also areas in which paetec s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
in addition to reviewing the foregoing list  paetec encourages you to review carefully the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  where you will find a more comprehensive description of the company s accounting policies and additional disclosures that are required by generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital resources paetec finances its operations and growth primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under credit facilities  issuances of debt securities  operating leases and normal trade credit terms 
to fund its recent expansion through significant acquisitions  beginning in february with the us lec merger and including the acquisition of mcleodusa in february  paetec has increased its borrowings under a variety of debt arrangements 
sources and uses of cash 
paetec s cash flows for  and were as follows in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities for were consistent with those for  with a million increase in net income adjusted for non cash items being offset by a million decrease in working capital 
the million increase in cash flows from operating activities for over was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income adjusted for non cash items and a million increase in working capital 

table of contents paetec s investing activities for consisted primarily of activities related to the purchase and installation of property and equipment 
paetec s investing activities for consisted primarily of activities related to the mcleodusa merger and the purchase and installation of property and equipment 
paetec s investing activities for consisted primarily of activities related to the us lec merger  the acquisition of allworx corp  and the purchase and installation of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities of million for was primarily related to the repayment of million principal amount of borrowings under paetec s senior secured credit facilities with the proceeds of an offering of million principal amount of its senior secured notes due  which we refer to as the senior secured notes  the payment of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with paetec s issuance and sale of the senior secured notes  and the repayment of million in aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under paetec s revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for of million was primarily related to million of borrowings incurred under paetec s incremental term loan facility  a portion of which was applied toward the redemption of mcleodusa s outstanding senior secured notes in connection with the mcleodusa acquisition and million of borrowings under paetec s revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million and primarily reflected paetec s borrowings of billion to finance the us lec merger  the effect of which was offset in part by the early retirement of us lec s debt 
contractual obligations and commitments 
paetec has various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
paetec does not have off balance sheet financing arrangements other than its letters of credit and operating leases 
as of december   paetec was party to letters of credit totaling million 
paetec does not expect any material losses from their resolution since performance under these letters of credit is not likely to be required 
the following table sets forth paetec s future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the long term debt obligations in the table above reflect the senior credit facilities and note issues outstanding at december  and do not reflect the issuance of additional senior secured notes in january and the application of the proceeds of that sale except as described below 
on january   paetec issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of its senior secured notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of june   as supplemented as of january   under which paetec had issued million in aggregate principal amount of its senior secured notes on june  paetec applied a portion of the proceeds from the january sale of the senior secured notes to repay million in aggregate principal amount of term loans and million in aggregate principal of revolving loans outstanding under its senior secured credit facilities 
as a result of the issuance of the additional senior secured notes in january and in accordance with asc topic  debt  paetec has presented million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under its senior secured credit facilities as maturing in in the table above as of december  
table of contents the long term debt obligations in the table above also do not include scheduled interest payments on paetec s variable rate senior secured credit facilities outstanding at december   which are generally based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  and fixed rate senior notes

if paetec s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient 
in addition  if paetec seeks to acquire other businesses or to accelerate the expansion of its business  it may be required to seek additional capital 
additional sources may include equity and debt financing and other financing arrangements  such as vendor financing 
in addition  if paetec believes it can obtain additional debt financing on advantageous terms  paetec may seek such financing at any time  to the extent that market conditions and other factors permit it to do so 
the debt financing paetec may seek could be in the form of additional term loans under its senior secured credit facilities or additional debt securities having substantially the same terms as  or different terms from  paetec s outstanding senior notes and senior secured notes 
any inability of paetec to generate the sufficient funds that it may require or to obtain such funds under reasonable terms could limit its ability to increase its revenue or to operate profitably 
paetec s ability to raise any required funds is subject to restrictions imposed by covenants contained in its existing debt agreements and could be negatively affected by a continuation of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk paetec is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
paetec manages the sensitivity of its results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of short term  interest bearing securities and by entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate pricing and terms 
paetec does not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading 
table of contents purposes  although at december  the company held some derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
paetec does not have any material foreign currency exposure 
paetec s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates associated with borrowings the company used to fund the expansion of its business and to support its acquisition activities 
the interest rates that paetec is able to obtain on this debt financing depend on market conditions 
paetec s policy is to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate swap contracts to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
as of december   million of paetec s long term debt consisted of variable rate instruments that accrue interest at floating rates 
as of the same date  through an interest rate swap contract  paetec had capped its interest rate exposure through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to paetec s million of variable rate debt subject to an interest rate swap contract as of december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in the company s annual interest expense in the absence of the interest rate swap contracts 
all foregoing variable rate debt was repaid in january with the proceeds of the offering of million principal amount of paetec s senior secured notes  as described in note and note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report
