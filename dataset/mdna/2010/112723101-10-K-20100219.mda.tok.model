overview during the year ended december   selling communities have seen an increased number of homebuyers take advantage of improved affordability  low interest rates  declining home prices and government stimulus programs 
while the united states homebuilding industry continues to face a number of challenges with home foreclosures and tight credit standards continuing to have an effect on inventory and new home sale rates and prices  homebuyer confidence has improved as homebuyers appear to have recognized that home prices have begun to stabilize 
despite the challenging conditions still faced by the homebuilding market  we believe the risk is mitigated by our assets which are largely located in geographic areas with a constrained supply of lots and which have demonstrated strong economic characteristics over the long term 
through the activities of our operating subsidiaries  we entitle and develop land for our own communities and sell lots to third parties 
we also design  construct and market single and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers 
we operate in the following geographic regions  which are presented as our reportable segments northern california san francisco bay area and sacramento  southland los angeles  san diego riverside and the washington dc area 
our other operations that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate segment disclosure are included in corporate and other 
for the five year period to  cash provided from operations was million  which was used primarily to return cash to stockholders through the repurchase of shares and to repay debt 
despite the continuing challenges of the united states housing market  we believe our business is positioned to create further stockholder value over the long term through the selective control of a number of strategic projects and the overall level of lots controlled 
the  lots that we control   of which we own directly  are held through unconsolidated entities or consolidated inventory not owned  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow 
we believe we add value to the lots we control through entitlements  development and the construction of homes 
in allocating capital to our operations  we generally limit our risk on unentitled land by optioning such land positions in all our markets thereby mitigating our capital at risk 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control lots for an extended period of time 
homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented approximately of our total revenue since operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price 
we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders  generally on an opportunistic basis where we can reduce our risk in a market or redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns 
in  we sold lots to homebuilders 
the number of lots we sell may vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and nature of such sales which are also affected by local market conditions 
our housing and land inventory  investments in unconsolidated entities  and consolidated land inventory not owned together comprised of our total assets as of december  in addition  we had million in other assets 
other assets consist of restricted cash of million  income taxes receivable of million  deferred taxes of million  and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes 
as at december   the market capitalization of our common stock was million  compared to our book value of million 
market capitalization will vary depending on market sentiment and may not have a relationship to the underlying value of a share of our common stock over the longer term

cash flow our principal uses of working capital include home construction  purchases of land and land development

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents carrying values in accordance with the asc topic property  plant and equipment formerly statement of financial accounting standard sfas  housing and land assets we own directly and through unconsolidated entities are reviewed for recoverability on a regular basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at the estimated fair value of housing and land inventory impaired  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
specifically  on a housing project  we evaluate the margins on homes that have been closed  margins on sales contracts which are in backlog and estimated margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the project 
on a land project  we estimate the timing of future land sales  the estimated revenue per lot  as well as estimated margins with respect to future land sales 
for the housing and land inventory  we continuously evaluate projects where inventory is turning over slower than expected or whose average sales price and margins are declining and are expected to continue to decline 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project and management s best estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
such projections generally assume current home selling prices  cost estimates and sales rates for short term projects are consistent with recent sales activity 
for longer term projects  planned sales rates for and assume recent sales activity and normalized sales rates beyond we identify potentially impaired housing and land projects based on these quantitative factors as well as qualitative factors obtained from the local market areas 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered to be impaired and is then written down to fair value less estimated selling costs using a discounted cash flow methodology which incorporates market participant assumptions 
we have also entered into a number of option contracts to acquire land or lots in the future in accordance with specific terms and conditions 
a majority of the option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the property 
the option contracts are recorded at cost 
in determining whether to pursue an option contract  we estimate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the optioned property 
if the intent is to no longer pursue an option contract  we record a charge to earnings of the deposit amounts and any other related pre acquisition entitlement costs in the period the decision is made 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
direct costs are capitalized to individual homes and lots and other costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and lots sold are recorded at the time of closing 
these estimates are prepared on an individual home and lot basis and take into account the specific cost components of each individual home and lot 
the estimation process to allocate costs to homes and lots is dependent on project budgets that are based on various assumptions  including construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
these estimates are reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing and adjustments are made if necessary 
if the estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of homes are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  wherein all proceeds are received or collectability is evident 
land sales are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  all material conditions of the sales contract have been met and a significant cash down payment or appropriate security is received  and collectability is evident 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc topic income taxes formerly sfas 
under asc topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured by using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse 
in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  we assess  on a quarterly basis  our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we consider the following significant factors an assessment of recent years profitability and losses which considers the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses adjusted to reflect the effects of changes to our capital structure that have resulted in a 
table of contents significant reduction in the amount of interest bearing debt  our forecasts or expectation of profits based on margins and volumes expected to be realized which are based on current pricing and volume trends and including the effects of reduced interest expense  the financial support of our largest stockholder as evidenced by the revolving credit facilities  the long duration of ten to twenty years or more in all significant operating jurisdictions before the expiry of net operating losses  and we take into consideration that a substantial portion of the deferred tax asset is composed of deductible temporary differences that are not subject to an expiry period until realized under tax law 
however  the recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon assumptions about the future including an estimate of future results  and differences between the expected and actual financial performance could require all or a portion of the deferred tax assets to be derecognized 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
at december  and  our deferred tax asset was million and million  respectively 
based on the more likely than not standard in the guidance and the weight of available evidence  we do not believe a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset at december  is necessary

seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year
