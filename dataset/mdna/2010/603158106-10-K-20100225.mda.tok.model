these economic conditions caused a significant decrease in the demand for our products  as volumes declined in all businesses 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company responded quickly to the downturn in economic activity by establishing additional procedures to generate and conserve its cash and reduce costs by curtailing production through shortened work schedules  continuing its intensive expense control initiatives  and suspending its stock buyback program 
in the second quarter of  as a result of the continuation of the severe downturn in the worldwide steel industry  the company initiated a restructuring program to improve efficiencies through the consolidation and rationalization of certain manufacturing operations and through a further reduction of overhead costs 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment of assets charge of million  restructuring charges of million related to this realignment and pension settlement charges of million in the second half of volume declines as compared with prior year  however  more than offset the benefits derived from our announced restructuring programs and overall expense reduction initiatives 
as part of the restructuring program  the company will consolidate its old bridge  new jersey  operation into bryan  ohio  and baton rouge  louisiana  in order to improve operational efficiencies and reduce logistics for key raw materials  resulting in an impairment of assets charge of million  rationalize its north american specialty shapes product line resulting in an impairment of assets charge of million  rationalize some of its european operations resulting in an impairment of assets charge of million  record further impairment charges of million related to its asian refractory operations and actively seek a regional alliance to aid in marketing its high value product 
in addition  we recognized impairment charges for refractory application equipment in north america of million and europe of million due to customer underutilized assets under depressed volume conditions  an impairment of million related to the company s pcc facility in millinocket  maine  which has been idle since september and where the start up of the satellite facility became unlikely 
the company will also reduce its current workforce by approximately employees related to the plant consolidations as well as the streamlining of corporate and divisional management structures to operate more efficiently through the current economic environment 
this realignment allowed the company to better position itself strategically for improved profitability as the economy recovers 
in october  domtar corporation announced its intention to cease production of paper grades requiring pcc at its plymouth  north carolina  paper mill and international paper announced the closure of its franklin  virginia  mill 
the company has satellite pcc facilities at these paper mills and we expect these satellites to cease production in the second quarter of as a result  an impairment of assets charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
we expect that these events will have a negative impact on our operating performance in combined sales for these facilities in were million 
worldwide net sales for were million  a decline of from sales of billion 
foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately million  or percentage points of the decline 
loss from operations was million in as compared with income from operations of million in the prior year 
included in the operating loss in were restructuring charges of million and impairment charges of million  respectively 
included in the operating income of the prior year were restructuring costs of million and an impairment of assets charge of million 

table of contents loss from continuing operations was million as compared with income of million in the prior year due to the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as the impact of the downturn in the economy 
loss from discontinued operations was million in as compared with income from discontinued operations of million in the previous year 
in  an impairment of assets charge was recorded in discontinued operations to reflect the lower market value of the mt 
vernon  indiana  facility 
in  the company recorded gains of million from the sale of four idle facilities previously written down 
net loss for the year was million as compared with net income of million in the prior year 
the company s balance sheet as of december  continues to be very strong 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were more than million 
in addition  we have available lines of credit of million  our debt to equity ratio was very low at  and our current ratio was our cash flows from operations were in excess of million in the company  and each of its reporting segments  achieved a dramatically improved performance in the second half of versus the first half of as the industries we serve continued to contract in the first half but began to stabilize and even increase slightly in the second half 
in addition to an increase in volumes from improved market conditions in the second half  the company also began to realize the benefits of the restructuring program initiated in the second quarter of the company s production margin increased from million in the first half of to million in the second half  an improvement of 
sales increased million in the second half  an improvement of  due to higher volumes 
the specialty minerals segment production margin improved from million in the first half to million in the second half  an increase of on a increase in sales 
the refractories segment production margin improved from million in the first half to million in the second half  an increase of as sales increased million or 
although there have been signs of economic recovery beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into the fourth quarter  there remains uncertainty as to the long term sustainability of this market upturn and of the health of the overall economy 
the company feels  however  that due to our strong balance sheet  cash flow  and benefits derived as a result of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in and  coupled with the realignment of our operations in the second quarter of  the company is well positioned to achieve sustainable profitable growth as and when the economy recovers 
we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our global business could continue to be adversely affected by decreases in economic activity 
north american and european steel production in was approximately below production levels in in the paper industry  production levels for printing and writing papers within north america and europe  our two largest markets  were down as compared with prior year 
housing starts in were at a rate of approximately thousand units  down from prior year 
housing starts were at a peak rate of million units in in the automotive industry  north american car and truck production was down in as compared with the availability of credit in the financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and or our suppliers to obtain financing 
the industries we serve  primarily paper  steel  construction and automotive  have been adversely affected by the global economic climate 
some of our customers may experience further consolidations and shutdowns or may face increased liquidity issues  which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable  increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses 
consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
our filler fiber composite technology continues in development through customer trials  but has yet to be proven on a long term commercial scale 
we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line 
our ability to recover increased costs is uncertain and may become more difficult in this economic environment 
we continue to rely on china for a significant portion of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment which may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost 
fluctuations in energy costs have an impact on all of our businesses 
changes in the fair market value of our pension assets  rates of return on assets  and discount rates could have a significant impact on our net periodic pension costs as well as our funding requirements 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
the company s operations  particularly in the mining and environmental areas discharges  emissions and greenhouse gases  are subject to regulation by federal  state and foreign authorities and may be subject to  and presumably will be required to comply with  additional laws  regulations and guidelines which may be adopted in the future 

table of contents the company will continue to focus on innovation and new product development and other opportunities for continued growth as follows development of the filler fiber composite program  which continues to undergo large scale paper machine trials  to increase the fill rate for uncoated freesheet paper 
increasing our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  particularly in emerging markets 
further growth of the company s pcc coating product line using the satellite model 
leverage the company s expertise in crystal engineering  especially in helping papermakers customize pcc morphologies for specific paper applications 
development of unique calcium carbonates used in the manufacture of novel biopolymers  a new market opportunity 
rapid deployment of value added formulations of refractory materials that not only reduce costs but improve performance 
continuing our penetration in emerging markets 
further growth of pcc produced for paper filling applications by working with industry partners to develop new methods to increase the ratio of pcc for fiber substitutions 
further proliferation of operational excellence principles into all aspects of the organization  including system infrastructure and lean principles 
explore selective acquisitions to fit our core competencies in minerals and fine particle technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities

the tax benefit on the restructuring and impairments charge was million  or  an effective tax benefit of on such charge 
the factors having the most significant impact on our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion  restructuring and impairments  and the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested 
percentage depletion allowances tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves are available to us under the income tax laws of the united states for operations conducted in the united states 
the tax benefits from percentage depletion were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in compared to primarily is due to a decrease in mining sales

the effect on the company of this new law was to recognize an additional million in income tax expense 
we operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws  tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the united states 
many of these differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the united states statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the united states 
the effects of foreign earnings and the related foreign rate differentials resulted in an increase in income tax expense of million in and a decrease of income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the difference between and relates primarily to a restructuring of operations 
the decrease of income tax benefits in as compared to results from the restructuring losses in foreign jurisdictions and the income tax rate differential in the foreign jurisdictions 
during  tax expense increased by million due to the establishment of valuation allowances 
the valuation allowances were established primarily as a result of the restructuring as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be recognized as they relate to the restructured entities

our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially about ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  generally in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future sales growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate and  if not renewed  could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures and to repay short term and long term debt of million

in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 

table of contents property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  market capitalization below invested capital 
the company conducts its goodwill impairment testing for each reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter with the assistance of valuation specialists 
there is a two step process for testing of goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any impairment 
step one involves a developing the fair value of total invested capital of each reporting unit in which goodwill is assigned  and b comparing the fair value of total invested capital for each reporting unit to its carrying amount  to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value  then the step one test is failed  and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under step two 
the amount of impairment loss is determined in step two by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  pcc  processed minerals and refractories 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units in the fourth quarter of the fair value of each reporting unit materially exceeded the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the refractories reporting unit incurred an operating loss during the second quarter due to low sales volumes associated with weak steel industry market conditions and high raw material costs consumed from inventory  which were purchased in the summer of during the peak of the demand cycle for chinese sourced materials 
we have implemented a restructuring program for this reporting unit designed to improve profitability in and beyond by rationalizing certain manufacturing facilities to reach break even levels during low volume cycles and improve profitability at higher volumes 
in our valuation of the refractories reporting unit  we assumed minimal sales improvement for the remainder of our sales growth volume assumptions over the next five years range from to from the very low levels experienced in  utilizing several volume assumptions and sensitivity analyses 
in our assumptions  by  we only expect sales volumes to achieve on average of annualized sales volume levels achieved in the third quarter of as a result of some forecasted volume improvement from present levels  coupled with cost and expense savings associated with the restructuring program  the fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value and resulted in no impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill balance for each reporting unit as of december  was as follows in millions december  pcc processed minerals refractories total 
table of contents the invested capital and estimated fair value fv  excluding cash  for the refractories reporting unit as of october  were as follows in millions invested capital est 
fv refractories the invested capital  excluding cash  for the pcc and processed minerals reporting units as of october  were as follows in millions invested capital pcc processed minerals the fair value of the pcc and processed minerals product lines were materially in excess of the carrying value 
the company had approximately million in cash and short term investments as of october   which would increase both the invested capital and estimated fair values by the same amounts 
we estimate fair value of our reporting units by applying information available at the time of the valuation to industry accepted models using an income approach and market approach 
the income approach incorporates the discounted cash flow method and focuses on the expected cash flow of the reporting unit 
the market approach utilizes two methodologies  the guideline company method and the similar transactions method 
the guideline company method focuses on comparing the reporting units risk profile and growth prospects to selected similar publicly traded companies 
the similar transactions method considers prices paid in recent transactions in the reporting unit s industry or related industries 
we believe the income and market approaches are equally relevant to the determination of reporting unit fair value and therefore assigned equal weighting to each method 
the key assumptions we used in the income approach included revenue growth rates and profit margins based upon forecasts derived from available industry market data  a terminal growth rate and estimated weighted average cost of capital based on market participants for which the discount rates were determined 
for the refractories reporting unit  we assumed that revenues would decline approximately for the full year compared to the rate of sales decline would reduce in the fourth quarter of when compared with the fourth quarter of  which was the beginning of the effects of the recession in our markets 
our compound annual sales growth assumption from to is negative 
revenue growth was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our gross profit margin is forecast at between and over the next five years and had ranged between and over the last three years 
the terminal growth rates were projected at after five years  which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth 
we utilized discount rates of and in the valuation and  in addition  incorporated a company specific risk premium 
for the pcc and processed minerals reporting units  we assumed that revenues would decline approximately for the full year compared to the rate of sales decline would reduce in the fourth quarter of when compared with the fourth quarter of  which was the beginning of the effects of the recession in our markets 
our compound annual sales growth assumptions from to are less than for both the pcc and processed minerals product lines 
revenue growth was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our gross profit margin is forecast at between and over the next five years and had ranged between and over the last three years 
the terminal growth rates were projected at after five years  which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth 
we utilized discount rates of and in the valuation and  in addition  incorporated a company specific risk premium 
the key assumptions we used in the market approach represent multiples of sales and ebitda and were derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating characteristics as the reporting units 
the market multiples used in our assumptions ranged from to times forecasted sales and ranged from to times forecasted ebitda 
the impairment testing involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
actual results different from such estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences and forecasted operating earnings 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and business forecasts to provide insight 
amounts recorded for deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
such year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects 
effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of an average long term rate of return of 
while we believe we can achieve a long term average rate of return of  we can not be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations 
from inception through october   assets were strategically allocated among equity  debt and other investments to achieve a diversification level that dampens fluctuations in investment returns 
the company s long term investment strategy had an investment portfolio mix of approximately in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
the company s year average rate of return on assets through december  was over on its investment assets despite the significant losses realized in during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a capital conservation strategy as a result of the severe market volatility experienced in the latter part of as part of this strategy  the company temporarily invested its pension assets 
table of contents in fixed income securities due to the uncertainty in the markets but has not changed its long term investment strategy 
as of the end of the year  the company had approximately of its pension assets in fixed income securities 
during the first half of  we analyzed data provided by investment consultants who indicated the likely returns from a move to equities at that time were not significantly better than the expected returns from the capital conservation strategy and that such a change involved significantly more risk 
during the third quarter  we began a program of systematically moving funds back into equities 
the company intends to rebalance its investment portfolio and re evaluate to its long term investment strategy over the next twelve months as the markets continue to stabilize 
asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical and implied volatility of the company s stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility assumption of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life assumption 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set our anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and the accuracy of assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions in item a  risk factors 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 

table of contents cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires new disclosures  and clarifies existing disclosure requirements  about fair value measurements 
the clarifications and the requirement to separately disclose transfers of instruments between level and level of the fair value hierarchy are effective for interim reporting periods beginning after december   however  the requirement to provide purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level rollforward on a gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of the guidance is permitted 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
these amendments  effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non software deliverable 
the implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb implemented the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification simplifies the classification of accounting standards into one online database under a common referencing system  organized into eight areas  ranging from industry specific to general financial statement matters 
use of the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the company began to use the codification on the effective date  and it had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  throughout this annual report  all references to prior fasb  aicpa and eitf accounting pronouncements have been removed  and all non sec accounting guidance is referred to in terms of the applicable subject matter 
in may  new guidance was issued on subsequent events 
the standard provided guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
this standard is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after june  this implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
in december  a standard was issued which will require more detailed disclosures about employers pension plan assets 
the new disclosure requirement will require additional information regarding investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
this new standard amends disclosure requirements for periods ending after december  the company adopted this pronouncement as of december  in march  a statement was issued which amends the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires companies with derivative instruments to provide enhanced disclosures that would enable financial statement users to understand how derivative instruments affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after november   with early adoption encouraged 
the company adopted this pronouncement as of january  in february  a statement was issued which excludes fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification 
in addition  the effective date of fair value measurement requirements for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities was deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  in december  a statement was issued that changed the requirements for an acquirer s recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination 
this statement is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively for all business combinations entered into after the date of adoption 
in december  a statement was issued on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of this statement require i that noncontrolling minority interests be reported as a component of shareholders equity  ii that net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations  iii that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions  iv that any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value  and v that sufficient disclosures are provided that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this statement is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
however  the presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of the provisions of this statement has not materially impacted the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between january and july of the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was a liability of million and million  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward contracts to purchase million euros as a hedge of its net investment in europe 
these contracts mature in october the fair value of these instruments at december  was a liability of million 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million
