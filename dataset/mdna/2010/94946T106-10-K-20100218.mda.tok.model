item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
services coverage medicaid the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve effectively our constituencies in the communities in which we operate 
although our medicaid contracts determine  to a large extent  the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs 
in addition  members generally must receive a referral from their primary care physician pcp in order to receive health care from a specialist  such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicare we also cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our ma plans 
we provide additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our ma plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ma ccps are required to use our network of providers except in specific cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs 
ma ccp members may see an out of network specialist if they receive a referral from their pcp and may pay incremental cost sharing 
we have some flexibility in designing benefit packages and we offer benefits that original medicare fee for service coverage does not offer 
we also offer special needs plans for those who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid d snps  in most of our markets 
d snps are ma ccps designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries with frailties or serious chronic conditions 
we believe that our 
table of contents d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
another type of medicare plan is the pffs plan 
pffs plans are open access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the medicare program  is willing to bill the plan for reimbursement and accepts the plan s terms and conditions 
we ceased offering pffs plans as of january  the medicare part d prescription drug benefit is available to ma enrollees as well as original medicare enrollees 
we offer part d coverage through stand alone pdps and as a component of many of our ma plans 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
pffs beneficiaries can join a pffs plan that has part d drug coverage or join a plan without such coverage and choose either to obtain a drug benefit from a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ma ccps can join a plan with part d coverage or forego part d coverage 
provider networks we contract with a wide variety of health care providers to provide our members with access to medically necessary services 
our contracted providers deliver a variety of services to our members  including primary and specialty physician care  laboratory and imaging  inpatient  outpatient  home health and skilled facility care  medication and injectable drug therapy  ancillary services  durable medical equipment and related services  mental health and chemical dependency counseling and treatment  transportation  and dental  hearing and vision care 
the following are the types of providers in our medicaid and ma ccp contracted networks professionals such as pcps  specialty care physicians  psychologists and licensed master social workers  facilities such as hospitals with inpatient  outpatient and emergency services  skilled nursing facilities  outpatient surgical facilities  diagnostic imaging centers and laboratory providers  ancillary providers such as home health  physical therapy  speech therapy  occupational therapy  ambulance providers and transportation providers  and pharmacies  including retail pharmacies  mail order pharmacies and specialty pharmacies 
these providers are contracted through a variety of mechanisms  including agreements with individual providers  groups of providers  independent provider associations  integrated delivery systems and local and national provider chains such as hospitals  surgical centers and ancillary providers 
we also contract with other companies who provide access to contracted providers  such as pharmacy  dental  hearing  vision  transportation and mental health benefit managers 
pcps play an important role in coordinating and managing the care of our medicaid and ma ccp products 
this coordination includes delivering preventive services as well as referring members to other providers for medically necessary services 
pcps are typically trained in internal medicine  pediatrics  family practice  general practice and  in some markets  obstetrics and gynecology 
in rare instances  a physician trained in sub specialty care will perform primary care services for a member with a chronic condition 
to help ensure quality of care  we credential and recredential all professional providers with whom we contract  including physicians  psychologists  licensed master social workers  certified nurse midwives  advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide care under the supervision of a physician  directly or through delegated arrangements 
this credentialing and recredentialing is performed in accordance with standards required by cms and consistent with the standards of the national committee for quality assurance ncqa 
our typical professional and ancillary agreements provide for coverage of medically necessary care and have terms of one year 
these contracts automatically renew for successive one year periods unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
these contracts typically can be cancelled by either party  without cause  upon days written notice 
facility  pharmacy  dental  vision and behavioral health contracts cover medically necessary services and  under some of our plans  enhanced benefits 
these contracts typically have terms of one to four years 
these agreements may also automatically renew at the end of the contract period unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
during the contract period  these agreements typically can be terminated without cause upon written notice by either party  but the notification period may range from to days and early termination may impose financial penalties on the terminating party 

table of contents the contract terms require providers to participate fully with our quality improvement and utilization review programs  which we may modify from time to time  as well as applicable state and federal regulations 
provider reimbursement methods physicians and provider groups we reimburse some of our pcps on a fixed fee per member per month pmpm basis 
this type of reimbursement methodology is commonly referred to as capitation 
the reimbursement covers care provided directly by the pcp as well as coordination of care from other providers as described above 
in certain markets  services such as vaccinations and laboratory or screening services delivered by the pcp may warrant reimbursement in addition to the capitation payment 
further  in some markets  pcps may also be eligible for incentive payments for achieving certain measurable levels of compliance with our clinical guidelines covering prevention and health maintenance 
these incentive payments may be paid as a periodic bonus or when submitting documentation of a member s receipt of services 
in all instances  we require providers to submit data reporting all direct encounters with members 
this data helps us to monitor the amount and level of medical treatment provided to our members to help improve the quality of care being provided and improve our compliance with regulatory reporting requirements 
our regulators use the encounter data that we submit  as well as data submitted by other health plans  to set reimbursement rates  assign membership  assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance 
we are reviewing our payment and data collection methods  particularly under capitated arrangements  to improve the accuracy and completeness of our encounter data 
pcps in our ma ccp products and  in limited instances  in our medicaid products  are eligible for a specialized risk arrangement to further align our interests with those of the pcps 
under these arrangements  we establish a risk fund for each provider based on a percentage of premium received 
we periodically evaluate and monitor this fund on an individual or group basis to determine whether these providers are eligible for additional payments or  in the alternative  whether they should reimburse us 
payments due to us are carried forward and offset against future payments 
specialty care providers and  in some cases  pcps  are typically reimbursed a specified fee for the service performed  which is known as fee for service 
the specified fee is set as a percentage of the amount medicaid or medicare would pay under the fee for service program 
in limited instances  specialty care provider groups in certain regions are paid a capitation rate to provide specialty care services to members in those regions 
for the year ended december   approximately of our payments to physicians serving our medicaid members were on a capitated basis and approximately were on a fee for service basis 
during the year ended december   approximately of our payments to physicians serving our medicare members in ma ccps were on a capitated basis and approximately were on a fee for service basis 
facilities inpatient services are typically reimbursed as a fixed global payment for an admission based on the associated diagnosis related group  or drg  as defined by cms 
in many instances  certain services  such as implantable devices or particularly expensive admissions  are reimbursed as a percentage of hospital charges either in addition to  or in lieu of  the drg payment 
certain facilities in our networks are reimbursed on a negotiated rate paid for each day of the member s admission  known as a per diem 
this payment varies based upon the intensity of services provided to the member during admission  such as intensive care  which is reimbursed at a higher rate than general medical services 
facility outpatient services facility outpatient services are reimbursed either as a percentage of charges or based on a fixed fee schedule for the services rendered  in accordance with ambulatory payment groups or ambulatory payment categories  both as defined by cms 
outpatient services for diagnostic imaging and laboratory services are reimbursed on a fixed fee schedule as a percentage of the applicable medicare or medicaid fee for service schedule or a capitation payment 

table of contents ancillary providers ancillary providers  who provide services such as home health  physical  speech and occupational therapy  and ambulance and transportation services  are reimbursed on a capitation or fee for service basis 
pharmacy services pharmacy services are reimbursed based on a fixed fee for dispensing medication and a separate payment for the ingredients 
ingredients produced by multiple manufacturers are reimbursed based on a maximum allowable cost for the ingredient 
ingredients produced by a single manufacturer are reimbursed as a percentage of the average wholesale price 
in certain instances  we contract directly with the sole source manufacturer of an ingredient to receive a rebate  which may vary based upon volumes dispensed during the year 
out of network providers when our members receive services for which we are responsible from a provider outside our network  such as in the case of emergency room services from non contracted hospitals  we generally attempt to negotiate a rate with that provider 
in most cases  when a member is treated by a non contracted provider  we are obligated to pay only the amount that the provider would have received from traditional medicaid or medicare 
sales and marketing programs as of december   our employed sales force consisted of approximately associates 
we have developed our sales and marketing programs on a localized basis with a focus on the communities in which our members reside 
we often conduct our sales programs in community settings and in coordination with government agencies 
we regularly participate in local events and organize community health fairs to promote our products and the benefits of preventive care 
we also utilize traditional marketing methods such as direct mail  mass media and cooperative advertising with participating medical groups to generate leads 
consistent with our community focused approach  we employ a culturally diverse sales staff  which allows us to better serve a broader set of beneficiaries  including markets requiring specific language skills and cultural knowledge 
in addition  we have fee for service relationships with independently licensed insurance agents to help us promote our medicare plans in some markets 
our medicaid marketing efforts are heavily regulated by the states in which we operate  each of which imposes different requirements for  or restrictions on  medicaid sales and marketing 
these requirements and restrictions can be revised from time to time 
in addition  local market program design and competitive dynamics affect our sales efforts 
for example  the state of georgia does not permit direct sales by medicaid health plans 
in georgia  we rely on member selection and auto assignment of medicaid members into our plans 
florida also auto assigns medicaid recipients into participating health plans  but historically also permitted direct sales of medicaid plans as well 
however  effective january   the florida agency for health care administration ahca  which oversees the florida medicaid program  prohibited direct sales to medicaid recipients for all plans participating in the florida medicaid program 
ahca changed its method of assigning beneficiaries to plans effective august previously  the assignment algorithm allocated beneficiaries among all individual plans to each of our two subsidiaries in counties in florida in which both subsidiaries operate 
the revised algorithm will provide for the auto assignment of members to only one of the two subsidiaries in these florida counties 
this change will reduce the number of beneficiaries auto assigned to our plans 
our medicare marketing and sales activities are also heavily regulated by cms and the states in which we operate 
cms has oversight over all  and in some cases has imposed advance approval requirements with respect to  marketing materials used by ma plans  and our sales activities are limited to activities such as conveying information regarding benefits  describing the operations of managed care plans and providing information about eligibility requirements 
the activities of our independently licensed insurance agents are also regulated by cms 
as stated above  we were sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to and enrollment of members into all lines of our medicare business from march until the sanction was released in november we were released from the sanction in time for us to begin enrolling beneficiaries for the contract year on november   which was the first day ma plans were permitted to begin enrolling participants 
enrollment into our pdp program is impacted by the auto assignment of members  which is subject to a bid process whereby we submit to cms our estimated costs to provide services in the next fiscal year 
for example  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the cms regions for plan year and are therefore ineligible to receive auto assigned members in these regions at any time during ordinarily we would have been eligible to receive auto assigned members in the remaining regions at the beginning of the plan year  which is when a large number of members are auto assigned into new plans as a result of the reallocation of members from those plans that bid above the benchmark to those plans that bid at or below the benchmark 
however  the marketing and enrollment sanction against us in prevented us from receiving any january  auto assignments in those regions 
we are eligible to receive and have received auto assigned members subsequent to the initial benchmark reassignment 
due to factors such as these  the number of members auto assigned to us has varied from year to year 

table of contents for further detail regarding restrictions on marketing and sales activities  particularly those to be implemented under mippa  see part i item business regulation 
quality improvement we continually seek to improve the quality of care delivered by our network providers to our members and our ability to measure the quality of care provided 
our quality improvement program provides the basis for our quality and utilization management functions and outlines ongoing processes designed to improve the delivery of quality health care services to our members  as well as to enhance compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards 
each of our health plans has a quality improvement committee  which is comprised of senior members of management  medical directors and other key associates of ours 
each of these committees report directly to the applicable health plan board of directors which has ultimate oversight responsibility for the quality of care rendered to our members 
the quality improvement committees also have a number of subcommittees that are charged with monitoring certain aspects of care and service  such as health care utilization  pharmacy services and provider credentialing and recredentialing 
several of these subcommittees include physicians as members 
elements of our quality improvement program include the following evaluation of the effects of particular preventive measures  member satisfaction surveys  grievance and appeals processes for members and providers  site audits of select providers  provider credentialing and recredentialing  ongoing member education programs  ongoing provider education programs  health plan accreditation  and medical record audits 
several of our health plans are also accredited by independent organizations that have been established to promote health care quality 
for example  our florida hmos are currently accredited by the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc and our georgia hmo is accredited by ncqa 
as part of our quality improvement program  at times we have implemented changes to our reimbursement methods to reward those providers who encourage preventive care  such as well child check ups  prenatal care and or adoption of evidence based guidelines for members with chronic conditions 
in addition  we have specialized systems to support our quality improvement activities 
we gather information from our systems to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the services provided to achieve those improvements 
some examples of our intervention programs include a prenatal case management program to help women with high risk pregnancies deliver full term  healthy infants  a program to reduce the number of inappropriate emergency room visits  and a disease management program to decrease the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations 
the principal purpose of the board s health care quality and access committee is to assist the board by providing general oversight of our policies and procedures governing health care quality and access for our members  which helps provide overall direction and guidance to our quality improvement committees 
competition competitive environment 
we operate in a highly competitive environment to manage the cost and quality of services that are delivered to government health care program beneficiaries 
we currently compete in this environment by offering medicaid and medicare health plans in which we accept all or nearly all of the financial risk for management of beneficiary care under these programs 
we typically must be awarded a contract by the government agency with responsibility for a program in order to offer our services in a particular location 
some government programs choose to limit the number of plans that may offer services to beneficiaries  while other agencies allow an unlimited number of plans to serve a program  subject to each plan meeting certain contract requirements 
when the number of plans participating in a program is limited  an agency generally employs a bidding process to select the participating plans 
as a result  the number of companies with whom we compete varies significantly depending on the geographic market  business segment and line of business 
for example  in florida  the medicaid program does not specifically restrict the number of participating plans 
in contrast  the georgia families and peachcare program awards contracts to just three plans 
we currently compete with one or two other plans in each of the six regions in georgia 
likewise  in our medicare business  the number of competitors varies significantly by geography 
in most cases  there are numerous other medicare plans and other competitors 
we believe a number of our competitors in both medicare and medicaid have strengths that may match or exceed our own with respect to one or more of the criteria on which we compete with them 
further  some of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression 

table of contents competitive factors program participation 
regardless of whether the number of health plans serving a program is limited  we believe government agencies determine program participation based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include the terms of the bids as well as the breadth and depth of a plan s provider network  quality and utilization management processes  responsiveness to member complaints and grievances  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  financial resources  historical contractual and regulatory compliance  references and accreditation  and other factors 
competitive factors network providers 
in addition  we compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals  physicians  pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries 
we believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include reimbursement rates  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  potential to deliver new patient volume and or retain existing patients  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
auto assignment 
when establishing a contract  the agency with responsibility for the program determines the approach by which a beneficiary becomes a member of one of the plans serving the program 
generally  a government program uses either automatic assignment of members or permits marketing to members by a plan  though some programs employ both approaches 
some programs assign members to a plan automatically based on predetermined criteria 
these criteria frequently are based on a plan s rates  the outcome of a bidding process  or similar factors 
for example  cms auto assigns pdp members based on whether a plan s bids during the annual renewal process are above or below the cms benchmark 
however  as a result of the marketing and enrollment sanction against us in  we were not eligible to receive auto assignments of lis dual eligible beneficiaries into our pdps in the month of january  which is the month in which most auto assignment occurs 
we are eligible to receive auto assigned members in subsequent months  although the level of auto assignment in subsequent months is typically well below january levels 
in most states  our medicaid health plans benefit from auto assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan upfront but for whom participation in managed care programs is mandatory 
each state differs in its approach to auto assignment  but one or more of the following criteria is typical in auto assignment algorithms a medicaid beneficiary s previous enrollment with a health plan or experience with a particular provider contracted with a health plan  enrolling family members in the same plan  a plan s quality or performance status  a plan s network and enrollment size  awarding all auto assignments to a plan with the lowest bid in a county or region  and equal assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan in a specified county or region 
ahca changed its method of assigning beneficiaries to plans effective august previously  the assignment algorithm allocated beneficiaries among all individual plans to each of our two subsidiaries in counties in florida in which both subsidiaries operate 
the revised algorithm will provide for the auto assignment of members to only one of the two subsidiaries in these florida counties 
this change will reduce the number of beneficiaries auto assigned to our plans 
for more information about how we obtain our members  see part i item business sales and marketing programs 
marketing 
some government programs permit plan sponsors to market their plans to beneficiaries  resulting in ongoing competition among the plans to enroll members 
we believe a beneficiary selects a plan for membership based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include a plan s premiums and cost sharing terms  provider network composition  benefits and medical services  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
medicaid segment competitors 
in the medicaid managed care market  our principal competitors for state contracts  members and providers include the following types of organizations mcos 
managed care organizations mcos that  like us  receive state funding to provide medicaid benefits to members 
many of these competitors operate in a single or small number of geographic locations 
there are a few multi state medicaid only organizations that tend to be larger in size and therefore are able to leverage their infrastructure over a larger membership base 
competitors include private and public companies  which can be either for profit or non profit organizations  with varying degrees of focus on serving medicaid populations 
medicaid fee for service 
traditional medicaid offered directly by the states or a modified version whereby the state administers a primary care case management model 

table of contents medicare segment competitors 
in the medicare market  our primary competitors for contracts  members and providers include the following types of competitors original fee for service medicare 
original medicare is available nationally and is a fee for service plan managed by the federal government 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can go to any doctor  supplier  hospital or other facility that accepts medicare and is accepting new medicare patients 
medicare advantage and prescription drug plans 
ma and stand alone part d plans are offered by national  regional and local mcos that serve medicare beneficiaries 
employer sponsored coverage 
employers and unions may subsidize medicare benefits for their retirees in their commercial group 
the group sponsor solicits proposals from ma plans and may select an hmo  preferred provider organization ppo  pffs and or pdp 
medicare supplements 
original medicare pays for many  but not all  health care services and supplies 
a medicare supplement policy is private health insurance designed to supplement original medicare by covering the cost of items such as co payments  coinsurance and deductibles 
some medicare supplements cover additional benefits for an additional cost 
medicare supplement plans can be used to cover costs not otherwise covered by original medicare  but cannot be used to supplement ma plans 
regulation our health care operations are highly regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws  statutes  regulations and rules occur frequently 
to offer medicare and medicaid hmo coverage  we must apply for and obtain a certificate of authority or license from each state in which we intend to operate 
as of december   our health plans were licensed to operate as hmos in florida  new york  connecticut  illinois  indiana  georgia  louisiana  missouri  new jersey  ohio and texas 
to offer medicare prescription drug coverage  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma generally requires a pdp sponsor to be licensed under state law as a risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which the sponsor wishes to offer a pdp 
however  cms has implemented a waiver process to allow pdp sponsors to operate prior to obtaining state licensure if  among other reasons  the state has not acted on a sponsor s application within a reasonable period of time or does not have a pdp licensing process available to a sponsor 
the entities through which we offer our pdps are currently licensed in states plus the district of columbia 
in the remaining states  we operate under one of the previously mentioned cms waivers or other arrangements  which are approved through december as hmos and insurance companies  our businesses are regulated by state insurance departments and  in the case of some of our hmos  another state agency with responsibility for oversight of hmos in addition to the insurance department 
generally  the licensing requirements are the same for us as they are for commercial managed health care organizations 
we generally must demonstrate to the state that  among other things we have an adequate provider network  our quality and utilization management processes comply with state requirements  we have procedures in place for responding to member and provider complaints and grievances  our systems are capable of processing providers claims in a timely fashion and for collecting and analyzing the information needed to manage our business  our management is competent and trustworthy  we comply with the state s sales and marketing regulations  and we have the financial resources necessary to pay our anticipated medical care expenses and the infrastructure needed to account for our costs 

table of contents state regulation and required statutory capital though generally governed by federal law  each of our regulated subsidiaries  including our hmo and insurance subsidiaries  is licensed in the markets in which it operates and is subject to the rules and regulations of  and oversight by  the applicable state department of insurance doi in the areas of licensing and solvency 
each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed 
these reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits  examinations or reviews by the applicable state to review our operational and financial assertions 
each of our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from  or provide notice to  the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds or paying dividends to a related party  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any other change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum statutory net worth in an amount determined by statute or regulation  and we may only invest in types of investments approved by the state 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  and are administered by the states 
as of december   our connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  ohio  texas and pffs operations were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized company action level  or cal  which represents the amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of the required cal or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum net worth changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  the state of new york has adopted regulations that increase the reserve requirement by over an eight year period 
in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members 
for instance  because the georgia medicaid managed care program is still relatively new  all plans operating in georgia are required to maintain statutory capital at an rbc level equal to of the applicable cal 
moreover  if we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
each of our operating subsidiaries is required to be licensed by each of the states in which it conducts business 
each insurance company is licensed and regulated by the doi in its domestic state as well as the doi in each other state  commonly referred to as foreign jurisdiction  in which it operates 
for example  one of our insurance companies that offers our pdp product is licensed as a domestic insurance company in florida and operates as a foreign insurer in other states plus the district of columbia 
further  each of our hmos is licensed by the doi in its domestic state as well as the department of health  or similar agency 
in addition  our medicaid and s chip activities are regulated by each state s medicaid  s chip or equivalent agency  and our medicare activities are regulated by cms 
these agencies typically require demonstration of the same capabilities mentioned above and perform periodic audits of performance  usually annually 
state enforcement authorities  including state attorneys general and medicaid fraud control units  have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry  including health insurers and managed care organizations 
we routinely respond to subpoenas and requests for information from these entities and  more generally  we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business 
for a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings  see part i item legal proceedings 

table of contents medicaid as previously described  medicaid  which was established under the us social security act of  is state operated and implemented  although it is funded by both the state and federal governments 
within broad guidelines established by the federal government  each state establishes its own eligibility standards  determines the type  amount  duration and scope of services  sets the rate of payment for services  and administers its own program 
some of the states in which we operate award contracts to applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the state s requirements 
other states engage in a competitive bidding process for all or certain programs 
we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the state medicaid program that we are able to meet the state s operational and financial requirements 
these requirements are in addition to those required for a license and are targeted to the specific needs of the medicaid population 
for example we must measure provider access and availability in terms of the time needed for a member to reach the doctor s office  our quality improvement programs must emphasize member education and outreach and include measures designed to promote utilization of preventive services  we must have linkages with schools  city or county health departments  and other community based providers of health care  in order to demonstrate our ability to coordinate all of the sources from which our members may receive care  we must have the capability to meet the needs of disabled members  our providers and member service representatives must be able to communicate with members who do not speak english or who are hearing impaired  and our member handbook  newsletters and other communications must be written at the prescribed reading level and must be available in languages other than english 
in addition  we must demonstrate that we have the systems required to process enrollment information  report on care and services provided and process claims for payment in a timely fashion 
we must also have adequate financial resources to protect the state  our providers and our members against the risk of our insolvency 
once awarded  our medicaid government contracts generally have terms of one to five years 
most of these contracts provide for renewal upon mutual agreement of the parties and both parties have certain early termination rights 
in addition to the operating requirements listed above  state contract requirements and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth detailed provisions relating to subcontractors  marketing  safeguarding of member information  fraud and abuse reporting and grievance procedures 
our medicaid plans are subject to periodic financial and informational reporting and comprehensive quality assurance evaluations 
we regularly submit periodic utilization reports  operations reports and other information to the appropriate medicaid program regulatory agencies 
medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits 
medicare beneficiaries have the option to enroll in a ma plan  such as a ccp  pffs or ppo benefit plan  in areas where such a plan is offered 
under ma  managed care plans contract with cms to provide benefits that are comparable to  or that may be more attractive to medicare beneficiaries than  original medicare in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member that varies based on the county in which a member resides  the demographics of the member and the member s health condition 

table of contents the mma made numerous changes to the medicare program  including expanding the medicare program to include a prescription drug benefit 
since  medicare beneficiaries have had the option of selecting a new prescription drug benefit from an existing ma plan that offers it an ma pd or through a stand alone pdp 
the drug benefit  available to beneficiaries for a monthly premium  is subject to certain cost sharing depending upon the specific benefit design of the selected plan 
plans are not required to offer the same benefits  but are required to provide coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to the standard drug coverage delineated in the mma 
along with other part d plans  both pdps and ma pds  we bid on providing part d benefits in june of each year 
based on the bids submitted  cms establishes a national benchmark 
cms pays the part d plans a percentage of the benchmark on a pmpm basis with the remaining portion of the premium being paid by the medicare member 
members whose income falls below of the federal poverty level qualify for the federal lis  through which the federal government helps pay the member s part d premium and certain other cost sharing expenses 
on july   mippa became law and  in september  cms promulgated implementing regulations 
mippa impacts a broad range of medicare activities and impacts all types of medicare managed care plans 
the following are some of the requirements under mippa that impact our business sales and marketing mippa and subsequent cms guidance place prohibitions and limitations on certain sales and marketing activities of ma and pdps 
among other things  ma and pdps are not permitted to make unsolicited outbound calls to potential members or engage in other forms of unsolicited contact  cross sell non medicare products to existing members during ma or part d sales interactions  establish appointments without documented consent from potential members  provide meals to potential enrollees at sales events  or conduct sales events in certain provider based settings 
in response  we have focused on more formal marketing methods eg  advertising and other media generated activity during the most recent medicare enrollment period  which has served to increase our acquisition costs and slowed our sales 
further  the new mippa guidelines  along with the rapid and rigorous requirements to implement them  resulted in the violations that were the subject of the cms sanction that suspended our marketing and selling ability noted earlier 
special needs plans a significant portion of our ma ccp membership is enrolled in our d snps 
under mippa and subsequent cms guidance  d snps such as ours are required to contract with state medicaid agencies to coordinate care 
the scope of the d snp contract with the state medicaid agency varies greatly based on what eligibility categories  cost sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan 
the contracting process under mippa provides an opportunity for d snps and states to improve the coordination of benefits  including defining the overlap between medicaid and medicare benefits  eligibility verification processes  payment and coverage responsibilities  marketing and enrollment standards  appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations 
collaboration between states and d snps is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes 
however  the requirement to contract with state medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for d snp providers such as us because mippa does not allow continued operation of a d snp after if a state and the d snp provider cannot come to agreement on terms 
currently we have contracted with of the states in which we currently offer d snps 
while we are pursuing contracts with the remaining states  we are unable to provide assurances that our efforts will be successful or will result in terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
compensation mippa also establishes restrictions on agent and broker compensation 
the cms implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years  thereby creating a six year commission cycle with respect to members moving from original medicare and a five year commission cycle with respect to members moving from another ma plan 
cms has established specific limits on agent and broker compensation  set forth in agency guidance documents 
s chip programs s chip is a health insurance program that is designed to help states expand health insurance coverage to children whose families earn too much to qualify for traditional medicaid  yet not enough to afford private health insurance 
it is funded jointly by the federal government and the states 
states have the option of administering s chip through their existing medicaid programs  creating separate programs  or combining both strategies 
currently  all states  the district of columbia and all us territories have approved s chip or similar plans  and many states continue to submit plan amendments to further expand coverage under s chip 

table of contents hipaa and state privacy laws in  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and thereafter  the secretary of health and human services issued regulations implementing hipaa 
hipaa is intended to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims and related transactions 
all health plans  including ours  are subject to hipaa 
hipaa generally requires health plans to protect the privacy and security of patient health information through the implementation of appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards  and establish the capability to receive and transmit electronically certain administrative health care transactions  such as claims payments  in a standardized format 
we are also subject to state laws that are not preempted by hipaa  including those that provide for greater privacy of individuals health information 
fraud and abuse laws federal and state enforcement authorities have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud  waste and abuse 
fraud  waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of operating activities  including kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan  billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider  improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights 
companies involved in public health care programs such as medicaid and medicare are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud  waste and abuse  and are often the subject of fraud  waste and abuse investigations and audits 
the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change 
although we have structured our compliance program with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements  we are continuing to improve our education and training programs and to review and update our policies and procedures 
we have invested significant resources to enhance our compliance efforts  and we expect to continue to do so 
federal and state laws and regulations governing submission of information and claims to agencies we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that apply to the submission of information and claims to various agencies 
for example  the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity who it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback statute may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim 
in addition  a special provision under the false claims act allows a private person for example  a whistleblower such as a disgruntled former associate  competitor or member to bring an action under the false claims act on behalf of the government alleging that an entity has defrauded the federal government and permits the private person to share in any settlement of  or judgment entered in  the lawsuit 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted false claims acts that are similar to the federal false claims act 
marketing our medicaid marketing efforts are highly regulated by both cms and the states in which we operate  each of which imposes different requirements and restrictions on medicaid marketing 
in general  the states can impose a variety of sanctions for marketing violations  including fines  a suspension of marketing and or a suspension of new enrollment 
for more information about our marketing programs  see part i item business sales and marketing programs 
the marketing activities of medicare managed care plans are strictly regulated by cms 
for example  cms must approve all marketing materials before they can be used 
other examples include mippa prohibiting medicare plans like ours from making unsolicited contact with potential members by way of outbound telemarketing and community marketing  offering other types of medicare products to existing members  providing meals to potential enrollees and approaching potential members in common or public areas 

table of contents technology a foundation of providing managed care services is the accurate and timely capture  processing and analysis of critical data

in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  targets  predicts  potential  continues or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
you are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may affect our business 
these forward looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances  as they are based on management s current expectations and beliefs about future events and circumstances 
we undertake no obligation beyond that required by law to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements as a result of various important factors including the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our state and federal contracts 
in addition  our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend  in large part  on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses 
a variety of factors  including competition  changes in health care practices  changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations  inflation  provider contract changes  changes in or terminations of our contracts with government agencies  new technologies  government imposed surcharges  taxes or assessments  reduction in provider payments by governmental payors  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of health care  such as major health care providers inability to maintain their operations  may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses 
governmental action or inaction could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs or other operating expenses 
once set  premiums are generally fixed for one year periods and  accordingly  unanticipated costs during such periods generally cannot be recovered through higher premiums 
furthermore  if we are unable to estimate accurately incurred but not reported medical costs in the current period  our future profitability may be affected 
due to these factors and risks  we cannot provide any assurance regarding our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 
from time to time  at the federal and state government levels  legislative and regulatory proposals have been made related to  or potentially affecting  the health care industry  including but not limited to limitations on managed care organizations  including benefit mandates  and reform of the medicaid and medicare programs 
any such legislative or regulatory action  including benefit mandates or reform of the medicaid and medicare programs  could have the effect of reducing the premiums paid to us by governmental programs  increasing our medical or administrative costs or requiring us to materially alter the manner in which we operate 
we are unable to predict the specific content of any future legislation  action or regulation that may be enacted or when any such future legislation or regulation will be adopted 
therefore  we cannot predict accurately the effect or ramifications of such future legislation  action or regulation on our business 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  together with all the other information included in this report  in evaluating our company and our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and the value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
as such  you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
in addition  although for ease of reading we have categorized our risk factors as relating to pending governmental investigations and litigation  business  being a regulated entity  and our common stock  it is important to recognize that as a regulated entity  many of these risks are necessarily related to each other and should not be viewed as separate and distinct 

table of contents risks related to pending governmental investigations and litigation any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement the dpa with the united states attorney s office for the middle district of florida the usao and the florida attorney general s office 
the dpa resolved previously disclosed investigations by those offices 
in we also consented to the entry of a final judgment against us in the us district court for the middle district of florida the consent and final judgment to resolve the previously disclosed informal investigation conducted by the sec 
however  we remain under investigation by the civil division of the us department of justice the civil division and the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services the oig 
for more information regarding the dpa and the consent and final judgment  please see part i item legal proceedings 
we remain engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the civil division and the oig 
any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by these agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as previously disclosed  we have paid the usao a total of million pursuant to the terms of the dpa 
pursuant to the consent and final judgment  we agreed to pay a penalty of million to the sec 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  management estimates that we have a liability of approximately million plus interest associated with the matters remaining under investigation 
we anticipate these amounts will be payable in installments over a period of four to five years 
in accordance with fair value accounting guidance  we discounted the liability and recorded it at its current fair value of approximately million 
this amount remains accrued in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  within the short and long term portions of amounts accrued related to investigation resolution line items 
the final timing  terms and conditions of a resolution of these matters may differ from those currently anticipated  which may result in an adjustment to our recorded amounts 
these adjustments may be material 
we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the civil division or the oig 
in addition  we have responded to subpoenas issued by the state of connecticut attorney general s office involving transactions between us and our affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of connecticut s medicaid program 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any pending investigations will result in the imposition of operating restrictions on our business 
if we were to plead guilty to or be convicted of a health care related charge  potential adverse consequences could include revocation of our licenses  termination of one or more of our contracts and or exclusion from further participation in medicare or medicaid programs 
in addition  we could be required to operate under a corporate integrity agreement  which could require us to operate under significant restrictions  place substantial burdens on our management  hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates and cause us to incur significant costs 
further  the majority of our contracts pursuant to which we provide medicare and medicaid services contain provisions that grant the regulator broad authority to terminate at will contracts with any entity affiliated with a convicted entity or for other reasons 
any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the pendency of these investigations as well as the litigation described below could also impair our ability to raise additional capital  which may be needed to pay any resulting interest  civil or criminal fines  penalties or other assessments 
the dpa requires us to retain an independent monitor at our expense for a period of months which could divert management s time from the operation of our business and which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we have retained an independent monitor the monitor  at our expense  for a period of months from his retention in august the monitor was selected by the usao after consultation with us 
operating under the oversight of the monitor may result in substantial burdens on our management  as well as hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates 
we currently cannot estimate the costs that we are likely to incur in connection with the retention of the monitor  including costs related to implementing any remedial measures recommended by the monitor 
in addition  the monitor may recommend significant changes to our policies and procedures  the consequences of which we are unable to predict 
our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any such costs  remedial measures and or changes to our policies and procedures 

table of contents if we commit a material breach of the dpa  we will likely be convicted of one or more criminal offenses  including health care fraud  which would cause us to be excluded from certain programs and would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and or licenses potentially having a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
pursuant to the dpa  the usao filed a one count criminal information the information in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the court  charging us with conspiracy to commit health care fraud against the florida medicaid program in connection with reporting of expenditures under certain community behavioral health contracts  and against the florida healthy kids programs  under certain contracts  in violation of usc section the usao recommended to the court that the prosecution of us be deferred during the duration of the dpa 
in the event of a knowing and willful material breach of a provision of the dpa  the usao has broad discretion to prosecute us through the filed information or otherwise 
we could also be prosecuted by the florida attorney general s office under such circumstances 
in light of the provisions of the dpa  any such proceeding would likely result in one or more criminal convictions  including for health care fraud  which  in turn  would cause us to be excluded from certain programs and could result in the revocation or termination of contracts and or licenses potentially having a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we and certain of our past officers and directors are defendants in litigation relating to our participation in federal health care programs  accounting practices and other related matters  and the outcome of these lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
putative class action complaints were filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors on october  and on november   alleging  among other things  numerous violations of securities laws 
subsequent developments in these cases are described below in part i item legal proceedings 
in addition  five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between october  and november  all five actions contend  among other things  that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused us to misrepresent our reported financial results  in amounts unspecified in the pleadings  and seek damages and equitable relief for  among other things  the defendants supposed breach of fiduciary duty  waste and unjust enrichment 
in april  the board formed a special litigation committee  comprised of a newly appointed independent director  to investigate the facts and circumstances underlying the claims asserted in the federal and state derivative cases and to take such action with respect to such claims as the special litigation committee determines to be in our best interests 
in november  the special litigation committee filed a report with the court finding  among other things  that we should pursue an action against three of our former officers 
additional information with respect to these cases is described below in part i item legal proceedings 
in addition  in a letter dated october   the civil division informed counsel to a special committee formed by the board the special committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
we are discussing with the civil division the allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  therefore  we do not know whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
at this time  we cannot predict the probable outcome of these claims 
these and other potential actions that may be filed against us  whether with or without merit  may divert the attention of management from our business  harm our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for a discussion of the aforementioned proceedings  see part i item legal proceedings 
our indemnification obligations and the limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
under delaware law  our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party  we have an obligation to indemnify  or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify  certain of our current and former directors  officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation  including the matters discussed in part i item legal proceedings 
in connection with some of these pending matters  we are required to  or we have otherwise agreed to  advance  and have advanced  significant legal fees and related expenses to several of our current and former directors  officers and associates and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending 
certain of these obligations may not be covered matters under our directors and officers liability insurance  or there may be insufficient coverage available 
further  in the event the directors  officers and associates are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification  we may not be able to recover the amounts we previously advanced to them 

table of contents in addition  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with the pending investigations and litigation 
we maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amounts of million for indemnifiable claims and million for non indemnifiable securities claims 
we have met the retention limits under these policies 
we also maintain insurance in the amount of million which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after january  for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after october we cannot provide any assurances that pending claims  or claims yet to arise  will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies  that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims 
due to these insurance coverage limitations  we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification and other obligations  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
as a result of the ongoing federal and state investigations  shareholder and derivative litigation  restatement during of our previously issued financial statements and related matters  we have been the subject of negative publicity 
this negative publicity may harm our relationships with current and future investors  government regulators  associates  members  vendors and providers 
for example  it is possible that the negative publicity and its effect on our work environment could cause our associates to terminate their employment or  if they remain employed by us  result in reduced morale that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and  therefore  associates and prospective associates may also consider our stability and the value of any equity incentives when making decisions regarding employment opportunities 
additionally  negative publicity may adversely affect our reputation  which could harm our ability to obtain new membership  build or maintain our network of providers  or business in the future 
for example  when making award determinations  states frequently consider the plan s historical regulatory compliance and reputation 
as a result  continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the investigations and related matters have diverted  and could divert in the future  management s attention  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition to the challenges of the various government investigations and extensive litigation we face  our management team has spent considerable time and effort with regard to internal and external investigations involving our historical accounting practices and internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
it is possible that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and general counsel  in particular  as well as senior members of our finance and legal departments  will spend considerable time and effort with regard to the investigations and related matters 
the significant time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted  and could divert in the future  its attention  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our business if our government contracts are not renewed or are renewed on substantially different terms  are terminated or become subject to an enrollment or marketing freeze  are canceled by the state due to  among other reasons  inadequate program funding contained within such state s budget  or are subjected to decreases or limited increases in premiums  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we provide our medicaid  medicare  s chip and other services through a limited number of contracts with state  federal or local government agencies 
these contracts generally have terms of one to five years and are subject to non renewal by the applicable government agency 
all of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
our federal and state government contracts are generally subject to cancellation  non renewal or a potential freeze on marketing or enrollment in the event of the unavailability of adequate program funding  compliance violations and for other reasons 
in some jurisdictions  a cancellation or enrollment freeze may be immediate  while in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
for example  during  cms imposed an immediate  nine month marketing sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of  and enrollment of members into  all lines of our medicare business 
this sanction reduced our revenue as we were unable to enroll new members during this period and the sanction has prevented us from receiving auto assigned membership in january  which is generally the month with the most auto assigned members as it is the start of the medicare plan year 
in addition  we incurred additional administrative costs to correct and remediate areas in which cms determined we were deficient 

table of contents the risk of program cancellation or decreases in premium is heightened during economic environments such as we are now experiencing as state governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their medicaid programs 
budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in premium rates that are inadequate to fund the required benefits 
states may also postpone payment until additional funding sources are available  which to the extent we have paid amounts to providers  would materially and adversely impact our liquidity 
in some jurisdictions cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
in the event a state imposes additional contract terms on us or otherwise makes changes to the contract that impact the economic feasibility of the contract  we may decide to terminate the contract 
for example  in january  we determined that it was economically infeasible for us to continue participating in the florida medicaid reform program after florida notified us that it was reducing our reimbursement rates 
consequently  we withdrew from the florida medicaid reform program effective july   which resulted in a loss of approximately  members 
however  we may not be able to terminate our state contracts without a lengthy notice period 
some of the states in which we operate have extended the period in which we are obligated to serve our members after we notify the state that we intend to exit 
for example  ohio has recently extended the required exit period in our contract from days to days 
if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  or amend the contract to our detriment  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability  cash available for operations and compliance with capital reserve requirements 
some of our contracts are also subject to termination or are only eligible for renewal through annual competitive bidding processes 
for example  renewal of our pdp business is subject to an annual bidding process 
for  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the cms regions and are ineligible to receive auto assigned members in these regions in as a comparison  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the regions in if we are unable to renew  re bid or compete successfully for any of our existing or potential government contracts  or if any of our contracts are terminated  or if any limitations or restrictions are imposed  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
to the extent that our encounter data is inaccurate or incomplete  we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct this data and have been and could be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties potentially including regulatory risk for noncompliance 
the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards  which are partly used by states to set premium rates 
in some instances  our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit 
on other occasions  there may be a period of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements 
in either case  it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data 
for example  the georgia department of community health dch requires all plans to satisfy specific requirements regarding the quality and volume of encounter data  including a requirement that all plans submit at least of their encounters based on value of claims paid 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  penalties or other operating restrictions until such time as all requirements have been met 
dch has engaged a third party to conduct an audit and reconciliation of our encounter submissions to determine our current and on going level of compliance with contractual encounter submission requirements 
during  dch fined our georgia plan an aggregate of million due to our continued failure to submit encounter data as required 
it is likely that our compliance will take additional time during which regulators may impose additional fines or penalties or take other action against us as a result of our lack of encounter data submission compliance 
as states increase their reliance on encounter data  challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data could affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and our ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the managed care industry historically has been subject to negative publicity 
this publicity may result in increased legislation  regulation and review of industry practices and  in some cases  litigation 
for example  the obama administration and certain members of congress have been questioning the profits of health insurance plans and the percentage of premiums paid that are going directly to health care benefits 
these inquiries have resulted in news reports that are generally negative to the health insurance industry 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and services  require us to change our products and services and increase regulatory or legal burdens under which we operate  further increasing the costs of doing business and materially adversely affecting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents cms will subject us to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight of all of our operational areas during the upcoming open enrollment periods  which could subject us to new sanctions or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us 
in connection with its removal of the marketing and enrollment sanction  cms informed us that it would subject us to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight of all of our operational areas during the open enrollment periods ie  the annual open election period aep and the medicare advantage open enrollment period oep 
in addition  cms stated that it will be frequently asking us for specific data to provide cms with assurance that the deficiencies that were the basis for the sanction are not likely to recur 
such surveillance  oversight and requests may impose additional administrative burdens on us to provide the information necessary to allow cms to evaluate our ongoing compliance  which could ultimately increase our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
if any of the underlying deficiencies that formed the basis for the cms sanction recur  including if we fail to be responsive to cms or to comply with cms timeliness requirements for responding to beneficiary complaints or cms identifies new deficiencies  we will be subject to the remedies available to cms under law  including the imposition of additional sanctions or penalties  contract nonrenewal or termination  as described in cfr parts and  subparts k and o  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  as a result of the cms sanction and its targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance of us  the recurrence of deficiencies that in prior periods resulted in fines or penalties to us that were not significant could result in increased fines and penalties and any such increases could be material 
because our medicaid premiums  which generate a significant portion of our total revenues  are fixed by contract  we are unable to increase our premiums during the contract term despite our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeding our estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
most of our medicaid revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these payments are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period  which is generally one to five years  to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by state and federal governments 
we have less control over costs related to the provision of health care services than we do over our selling  general and administrative expense 
historically  our medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band 
for example  our medical benefits expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
further  our regulators set premiums using actuarial methods based on historical data 
actual experience  however  could differ from those assumed in the premium setting process  which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense 
if our medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates or our regulators actuarial pricing assumptions  we will nonetheless be unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on ur results of operations 
relatively small changes in our medical benefits ratio mbr  can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
historically  our medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated 
factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies  including prescription drugs  whether as a result of inflation or otherwise  higher than expected utilization of healthcare services  particularly in patient hospital services  or unexpected utilization patterns  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician  and other provider contracts  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  new mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws  regulations  and practices  
table of contents new treatments and technologies  and contractual disputes with providers  hospitals  or other service providers 
we attempt to control these costs through a variety of techniques  including capitation and other risk sharing payment methods  collaborative relationships with pcps and other providers  case and disease management and quality assurance programs  and preventive and wellness visits for members 
despite our efforts and programs to manage our medical expenses  we may not be able to continue to manage these expenses effectively in the future 
if our medical expenses increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
changes in our member mix may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
our revenues  costs and margins vary based on changes to our membership mix  product mix and the demographics of our membership 
our revenues are generally comprised of fixed payments that are determined by the type of member in our plans 
the payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs required to serve members with various demographic and health risk profiles 
as such  there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our medicaid and medicare lines of business 
for instance  the rates we receive for an ssi member are generally significantly higher than for a non ssi member who is otherwise similarly situated 
as the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic  competitive  regulatory  benefit design  economic or other changes  there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue  costs and margins  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
reduction  delay or the inability of federal or state funding for health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability  cash flows and results of operations 
the federal government and many states from time to time consider reducing the level of funding for government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
for example  the deficit reduction act of the dra  signed into law on february   includes reductions in federal medicaid spending by approximately billion and reductions to medicare spending by approximately billion over a period of five years  according to the congressional budget office 
the dra reduces spending by cutting medicaid payments for prescription drugs and gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits 
this law may also lead to lower medicaid reimbursements in some states 
states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid and other programs 
in recent years  the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid and other health care programs costs and eligibility 
changes to medicaid and other health care programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs  all of which could have a negative impact on our business 
we believe that reductions in medicaid and other health care program payments could substantially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds  such cancellations could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
stimulus funds for medicaid in arra are anticipated to end in leaving certain states with sizable projected budget gaps in their medicaid programs 
absent additional federal assistance  these states may be under pressure to raise revenue  reduce provider payments  and reduce benefits or a combination of the above 
we continue to evaluate the impact proposed alternatives could have on our business and will take action as appropriate 
for example  one state that might be affected is florida 
according to the state of florida s long range financial outlook fiscal year through report  the state anticipates a number of budget challenges in the coming years 
this report notes that  overall  the general revenue fund is solvent for fiscal year  but has projected shortfalls in each of the three planning years despite the significant revenue growth projected for those years 
florida is one of our two largest medicaid customers 
although premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members  we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states of up to five months 
given the budget shortfalls in many states that we contract with  payment delays may reoccur in the future 
for example  the state of hawaii s department of human services hawaii dhs recently announced that as a result of hawaii s budget shortfall during its current fiscal year  hawaii dhs intends to withhold payments to plans offering services under the quest and quest expanded access programs  including ours  for a period of approximately three to four months 
while we and other affected health plans are urging hawaii dhs to reconsider its intention to defer payment  we can offer no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that any such delay would not ultimately go beyond four months 
our monthly premium on the hawaii medicaid program averages approximatley million 

table of contents the inability or failure to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs could result in operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems  applications and operations 
the information gathered  processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  marketing and sales and membership tracking  underwriting  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical care cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis and e commerce 
these systems also support our customer service functions  provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data 
these systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand 
there can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future  and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
moreover  operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions  including  but not limited to  claims payment  customer service and accurate financial reporting 
there can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems  developing new systems to support our operations and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our systems  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
additionally  events outside our control  including acts of nature such as hurricanes  earthquakes  fires or terrorism  could significantly impair our information systems and applications 
to help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary data center operations are rendered inoperable  we have a disaster recovery plan to recover business functionality within stated timelines 
our disaster plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations could be disrupted  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  fines and penalties  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if such breaches are not prevented 
we rely on a number of vendors  and failure of any one of the key vendors to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have contracted with a number of vendors to provide significant assistance in our operational support including  but not limited to  certain enrollment  billing  call center  benefit administration  claims processing functions  sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management 
our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under our contracts with them 
significant failure by a vendor to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  due to business changes or legal proceedings  our ability to manage these vendors may be impacted 
in addition  due to these factors  our vendors may request changes in pricing  payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we encounter significant competition for program participation  network providers and members  and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve  which may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes due to business consolidations  changes in regulation that could affect competitors differently  increased regulatory scrutiny  strategic alliances and growing revenue and cost pressures 
we compete principally on the basis of premiums and cost sharing terms  provider network composition  benefits and medical services provided  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate  see part i item business competition 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent on  and can be positively affected by  financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
competitors with greater financial resources than us may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression 
further  we operate in  or may attempt to acquire business in  programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process 
in these programs or markets  funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures  target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively impact our ability to maintain or acquire profitable business which could hurt our results of operations 
in addition  regulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets 
failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
we may not be able to retain or effectively replace our executive officers  other members of management or associates  and the loss of any one or more members of management and their managed care expertise  or large numbers of associates  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of the leadership  knowledge and experience of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business 
replacing one or more of the members of our management team might be difficult or take an extended period of time 
in addition  we may not be able to hire and retain our executive officers  other members of management or associates for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to the uncertainty about government health care policies and funding and the potential impact on us  uncertainty about potential future regulatory actions similar to the cms sanction  uncertainty surrounding ongoing governmental and company investigations and litigation  and decline of our stock price in light of the importance of equity in many of our compensation packages 
accordingly  all of these factors may impair our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our providers  we may be precluded from operating in some markets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 
our profitability depends  in large part  on our ability to enter into cost effective contracts with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers in appropriate numbers and at locations convenient for our members in each of the markets in which we operate 
in any particular market  however  providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical benefits expense 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions 
if such a provider or any of our other providers refused to contract with us or used their market position to negotiate contracts that might not be cost effective or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage  those activities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in that market 
also  in some rural areas  it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements 
in the long term  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating satisfactory contracts with our network providers  it could preclude us from renewing our medicaid or medicare contracts in those markets  from being able to enroll new members or from entering into new markets 
also  in situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network  regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out of network providers at no additional cost  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage expenses 

table of contents our provider contracts with network pcp and specialists generally have terms of one to four years  with automatic renewal for successive one year terms 
we may be unable to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to serve our members profitably 
we are also required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
finally  we may be unable to maintain our relationships with our network providers or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our results of operations and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans or enforce such rights may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to market our health plans under our brand names  including wellcare  healthease  staywell  and harmony 
we hold federal trademark registrations for the wellcare  healthease and harmony trademarks  and we are pursuing an application with the us patent and trademark office to register ohana health plan  inc design 
we use the staywell trademark only in the state of florida  and  pursuant to an agreement in august with the staywell company  a health education company based in st 
paul  minnesota  we will co exist with their use of that term for very different kinds of services and will not pursue a federal registration of that trademark 
it is possible that other businesses may have actual or purported rights in the same names or similar names to those under which we market our health plans  which could limit or prevent our ability to use these names  or our ability to prevent others from using these names 
if we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names  if others prohibit us from using such names or if we incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property rights in such brand names  our business  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
several members of our management team have been recently appointed to their positions  and a lack of familiarity with our company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
during the past year  our management team has undergone a number of changes  including the resignation of our chief executive officer  the elimination of the position of president of national medicare and the appointment of several members of senior management  some of whom have limited prior experience with our company or our industry 
our operations are highly dependent on the experience and skills of our management team 
the lack of familiarity and experience with us or our industry by some members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure of our state regulators to approve payments of dividends and or distributions from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non regulated subsidiaries may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  non regulated cash flows  business and financial condition 
in most states  we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or  in some states  any amount 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend or intercompany transaction is often not clearly defined 
health plans that declare ordinary dividends usually must provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date of such dividend 
extraordinary dividends require approval by state regulators prior to declaration 
if our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non regulated subsidiaries  our liquidity  non regulated cash flows  business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
our providers involved in medical care decisions and associates involved in coverage decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
some states have passed or are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations  or eliminates the requirement that providers carry a minimum amount of professional liability insurance 
this kind of legislation has the effect of shifting the liability for medical decisions or adverse outcomes to the managed care organization 
this could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or could cause us to pay additional premiums to increase our insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our associates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time  we are party to various other litigation matters including the matters discussed in part i item legal proceedings  some of which seek monetary damages 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation  and we may incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we maintain errors and omissions policies as well as other insurance coverage 
however  potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations  or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future or that insurance will continue to be available to us on a cost effective basis 
moreover  even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
risks related to our financial condition we may be unable to raise additional unregulated cash  if needed  in the current economic environment 
although  from time to time  we have maintained a line of credit to facilitate unregulated cash flows  we currently do not have a loan facility in place 
continued turmoil in the financial markets and general adverse economic conditions make it more difficult  and perhaps prohibitively costly  for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt  publicly or privately 
if we are unable to raise additional unregulated cash when needed  our unregulated cash balances will deteriorate  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  business condition and results of operations 
an intercompany loan arrangement currently in place could be terminated by insurance regulators  which would have a material adverse effect on our unregulated cash position and liquidity 
two of our regulated florida subsidiaries currently have intercompany loan arrangements in place lending a total of million to one of our non regulated subsidiaries 
the intercompany loan arrangement was for the purpose of commencing a new business that ultimately did not occur 
the loan arrangements require repayment in september and we do not intend to repay the loan until that time 
however  the florida regulators could require the regulated subsidiaries to terminate the intercompany loan arrangements before the due date  necessitating the borrowing subsidiary to repay in full the amount owed to the regulated florida subsidiaries 
if the borrowing subsidiary were required to repay the intercompany loans  or other restrictions were placed on the use of the loan proceeds  our unregulated cash balance could be reduced by up to million plus any accrued interest 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
as of december    our long term investments had an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million  and were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually anywhere from seven to days 
auctions for these auction rate securities have continued to fail and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the near future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven   or days  as the case may be  until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 

table of contents risks related to being a regulated entity cms s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and results of operations difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
cms has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms s risk adjustment model bases its reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors including hospital inpatient diagnoses  diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings  including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits  gender  age  and medicare eligibility 
cms requires all managed care companies to capture  collect  and report the necessary diagnosis code information to cms 
because of medicare advantage premiums are now risk based  it is more difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue and results of operations 
in addition  cms establishes premium payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions during the year on a retroactive basis 
the first such adjustment updates the risk scores for the current year based on prior year s dates of service 
the second such adjustment is a final retroactive risk premium settlement for the prior year 
as a result of the variability of factors  including plan risk scores  that determine such estimates  the actual amount of cms s retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and our accrual of premiums related thereto may result in adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the data provided to cms to determine the risk score is subject to audit by cms even after the annual settlements occur 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to cms previously received by us 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund  this refund could be significant in the future  which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that cms requires repayment 
in february  cms published preliminary results of a study designed to assess the degree of coding pattern differences between original medicare and medicare advantage and the extent to which any such differences could be appropriately addressed by an adjustment to risk scores 
cms s study of risk scores for medicare populations from through found that medicare advantage member risk scores increased substantially more than the risk scores for the general medicare fee for service population 
cms found that the overall risk scores of stayers a cms term referring to those persons who were enrolled either in the same medicare advantage plan or in original medicare during the study periods in medicare advantage increased more than those of original medicare stayers 
accordingly  in the advance notice of methodological changes for calendar year for medicare advantage capitation rates and part d payment policies  cms summarized findings from its analysis of risk scores over the time period and proposed to apply a coding intensity adjustment to contracts whose disease scores for stayers exceeded fee for service by twice the industry average 
the agency proposed to apply an adjustment that was calculated based on those contracts that fell above the threshold 
in response to the advance notice  cms received a significant number of comments on the proposed adjustment for medicare advantage coding differences  most of which disagreed with the view that cms had identified differences in coding patterns between medicare advantage and fee for service medicare 
cms then decided not to make a coding intensity adjustment for for calendar year  a negative coding intensity adjustment factor of will apply to all managed care plans 
the coding intensity adjustment factor would be applied to beneficiaries and risk scores  resulting in a decrease in our medicare revenue 
cms has begun a program to perform audits of selected ma plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each ma member 
our florida hmo contract has been selected by cms for audit for the contract year and we anticipate that cms will conduct additional audits of other contracts and contract years on an ongoing basis 
the cms audit of this data involves a review of a sample of provider medical records for the contract under audit 
we are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audit that is underway or that may be conducted in the future 
we are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that cms may make  based on the audit of our plan and others  will cause us to change our revenue estimation process 
at this time  we do not know whether cms will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of original medicare and other ma plan providers  and how  if at all  cms will extrapolate its findings to the entire contract 
however  it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur  and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows  possibly in and beyond 
reductions in funding for government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
all of the health care services we offer are through government sponsored programs  such as medicaid and medicare 
as a result  our profitability is dependent  in large part  on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels 
for example  the premium rates paid by each state to health plans like ours differ depending on a combination of factors such as upper payment limits established by the state and federal governments  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member 
table of contents eligibility categories 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints 
some of the states in which we operate have experienced fiscal challenges leading to significant budget deficits 
according to the national association of state budget officers  medicaid spending consumes a significant portion of the average state s budget 
health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past  as states continue to look at medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to medicaid health plans 
changes in medicaid funding may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for medicaid  reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits such as pharmacy  behavioral health or other benefits 
in some cases  changes in funding could be made retroactive  in which case we may be required to return premiums already received or receive reduced future payments 
in the recent past  all of the states in which we operate have implemented or considered legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement rates  payment levels  benefits covered or the number of persons eligible for medicaid 
reductions in medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate 
further  continued economic slowdowns in our markets have negatively impacted state revenues 
the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline more rapidly or in tandem with declining or stagnating economic conditions 
for example  the governments that oversee the medicaid programs could choose to limit program eligibility in an effort to reduce the portion of their respective state budgets attributable to medicaid  which would cause our membership and revenues to decrease 
therefore  declining or stagnating general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease even further  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
conversely  this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease  thereby causing our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to suffer  which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 
in addition  the states may also develop future medicaid capitation rates that  while actuarially sound  are insufficient to keep pace with medical trends or inflation  therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations 
we are experiencing pressure in many states and specifically on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
in  florida implemented medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to participate in the medicaid reform programs 
as a result  we withdrew from these programs effective july   which resulted in a loss of approximately  members 
current regulation in georgia related to payment of claims  eligibility determination and provider contracting  has negatively impacted expenses for the plan in and this may continue in the future 
further  continued economic slowdowns in florida and georgia  as well as other states  could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues 
similar to medicaid  reductions in payments under medicare or the other programs under which we offer health plans could likewise reduce our profitability 
the mma permits premium levels for certain medicare plans to be established through competitive bidding  with congress retaining the ability to limit increases in premium levels established through bidding from year to year 
the federal government also has passed legislation that phases out medicare advantage budget neutrality payments through  which impacts premium increases over that timeframe 
congress is considering other reductions to rates or other changes to medicare part d which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
legislation has been enacted to postpone a planned reduction in the physician fee schedule until february  we expect that the physician fee schedule cut implicit in the premium rates will not be enacted in and that the following are among the events that are likely to occur member benefits will be reduced  member premiums will be increased  and margins will decline 
these events are likely to have a negative affect on our operating results and membership 
in january  the obama administration took office 
although the new administration and congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system  the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed  in part  by reductions in the payments made under medicare and other government programs 
similarly  although congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  increases federal funding to s chip and president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act that provides funding for  among other things  state medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts  because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives  the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how medicaid and s chip funds will be used  we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business 

table of contents we are subject to extensive government regulation  and any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with our members  providers and the public 
any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to periodic reviews and audits under our contracts with state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties  fines or other sanctions on us and or our key associates  loss of our right to participate in government sponsored programs  including medicaid and medicare  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in marketing our products and services  inability to obtain approval for future service or geographic expansion  and suspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer  hmo or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service 
we are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several departments of insurance and cms to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
see cms s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and results of operations difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional risks associated with a current cms audit of one of our plans 
we are subject to laws and government regulations that may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to shareholders 
we are subject to state laws regarding insurers and hmos that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an hmo or insurance subsidiary 
for purposes of these laws  in most states control is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity  subject to certain exceptions 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular through unsolicited transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our shareholders find favorable 
we are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws which may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us  the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies  we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as fraud and abuse laws  including the federal false claims act  which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and  in some cases  to seek treble damages  penalties and assessments 
liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know  or it is found that we should have known  that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent  and some courts have permitted false claims act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements 
qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government 
qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years  causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action  pay fines or be excluded from the medicare  medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 
many states  including states where we currently operate  have enacted parallel legislation 

table of contents in a letter dated october   the civil division informed counsel to the special committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
we are discussing with the civil division the allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  therefore  we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
we can give no assurances that we will not be subject to civil actions and enforcement proceedings under these federal and state statutes and regulations in the future 
any such claims  proceedings or violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if state regulatory agencies require a higher statutory capital level for our existing operations or if we become subject to additional capital requirements  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries  which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity 
our operations are conducted through licensed hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined by each state 
one or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity 
for example  new york state adopted regulations that increase the capital reserve requirement by over an eight year period that will be fully implemented in the phased in increase in reserve requirements to which our new york plan is subject has  over time  materially increased our reserve requirements in one of our subsidiaries domiciled in new york 
other states may elect to adopt risk based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the naic 
as of december   our hmo operations in connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri and ohio  and our pffs operations  were subject to such guidelines 
our subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory net worth due to the adoption of risk based capital requirements by other states in which we operate 
our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators general oversight powers 
regardless of whether a state adopts the risk based capital requirements  the state s regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members 
for example  if premium rates are inadequate  reduced profits or losses in our regulated subsidiaries may cause regulators to increase the amount of capital required 
any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows and growth potential 
in addition  increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue to be profitable 
for example  we have decided to exit the medicare pdp program in wisconsin for due to that state s capital requirements  and auto assigned pdp membership in wisconsin will be re assigned to other plans 
several changes to the medicare program resulting from the mippa legislation could increase competition for our existing and prospective members and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
mippa was enacted in and impacts a broad range of medicare activities and all types of medicare managed care plans 
all of the changes imposed on us by mippa  including those discussed below  have the potential to cause us to incur additional administrative expense  lose membership and ultimately reduce our medicare revenues  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations sales and marketing mippa and subsequent cms guidance place prohibitions and limitations on certain sales and marketing activities of ma and pdps 
among other things  ma and pdps are not permitted to make unsolicited outbound calls to potential members or engage in other forms of unsolicited contact  cross sell non medicare products to existing members during ma or part d sales interactions  establish appointments without documented consent from potential members  provide meals to potential enrollees at 
table of contents sales events  or conduct sales events in certain provider based settings 
in response  we have focused on more formal marketing methods eg  advertising and other media generated activity during the most recent medicare enrollment period  which has served to increase our acquisition costs and slowed our sales 
further  the new mippa guidelines  along with the rapid and rigorous requirements to implement them  contributed to the violations that resulted in cms sanction that suspended our marketing and selling ability noted earlier 
special needs plans a significant portion of our ma ccp membership is enrolled in our d snps 
under mippa and subsequent cms guidance  d snps such as ours are required to contract with state medicaid agencies to coordinate care 
the scope of the d snp contract with the state medicaid agency varies greatly based on what eligibility categories  cost sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan 
the contracting process under mippa provides an opportunity for d snps and states to improve the coordination of benefits  including defining the overlap between medicaid and medicare benefits  eligibility verification processes  payment and coverage responsibilities  marketing and enrollment standards  appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations 
collaboration between states and d snps is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes 
however  the requirement to contract with state medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for d snp providers such as us because mippa does not allow continued operation of a d snp after if a state and the d snp provider cannot come to agreement on terms 
currently we have contracted with of the states in which we currently offer d snps 
while we are pursuing contracts with the remaining states  we are unable to provide assurances that our efforts will be successful or will result in terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
compensation mippa also establishes limits on agent and broker compensation 
the cms implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years  thereby creating a six year commission cycle with respect to members moving from original medicare and a five year commission cycle with respect to members moving from another medicare advantage plan 
we are required to comply with laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of health information  and we have not yet determined what our total compliance costs will be  however  such costs  when determined  could be more than anticipated  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
enacted into law in february  arra expanded and strengthened privacy and security requirements under hipaa  which applies to us 
arra imposes many hipaa security and privacy requirements directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to health plans  certain providers and healthcare clearinghouses 
in addition  arra further limits our use and disclosure of protected health information phi 
among other things  these limitations include prohibitions on exchanging phi for remuneration  restrictions on marketing to individuals  and the promise of new standards for the de identification of data 
arra also imposed new obligations on us to provide individuals with electronic copies of their health information  to agree to certain restrictions requested by individuals and eventually to provide individuals an accounting of virtually all disclosures of their health information 
most of these provisions became effective in february and many will be further clarified by regulations promulgated by the department of health and human services hhs 
the earliest compliance date for limitations on exchanging phi for remuneration and providing expanded accounting to individuals is in civil penalties for violations by either covered entities or business associates are increased up to an annual maximum of million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect 
imposition of these penalties is more likely because arra strengthens enforcement 
for example  commencing february  hhs is required to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance 
investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect  for which penalties are mandatory beginning in february  are statutorily required 
in addition  state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents 
initially monies collected will be transferred to a division of hhs for further enforcement  and within three years  a methodology will be adopted for distributing a percentage of those monies to affected individuals to fund enforcement and provide incentive for individuals to report violations 
in addition  commencing september  arra requires us to notify affected individuals  hhs  and in some cases the media when unsecured personal health information is subject to a security breach 
arra also contains a number of provisions that provide incentives for states to initiate certain programs related to health care and health care technology  such as electronic health records 
while provisions such as these do not apply to us directly  states wishing to apply for grants under arra  or otherwise participating in such programs  may impose new health care technology requirements on us through our contracts with state medicaid agencies 
we are unable to predict what such requirements may entail or what their effect on our business may be 

table of contents we are currently evaluating arra for its specific impact on us and our customers 
we will continue to assess our compliance obligations as regulations under arra are promulgated and more information becomes available from hhs and other federal agencies 
the new privacy and security requirements  however  may require substantial operational and systems changes  employee education and resources and there is no guarantee that we be able to implement them adequately or prior to their compliance date 
given hipaa s complexity and the anticipated new regulations  which may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation  our ongoing ability to comply with any of the hipaa requirement is uncertain  which may expose us to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under arra and may require us to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements 
future changes in health care law may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity 
health care laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our profitability by  among other things imposing additional license  registration and or capital requirements  increasing our administrative and other costs  requiring us to undergo a corporate restructuring  increasing mandated benefits  limiting our ability to engage in intra company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries  requiring us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers  restricting our revenue and enrollment growth  requiring us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
changes in state law  regulations and rules also may materially adversely affect our profitability 
requirements relating to managed care consumer protection standards  including increased plan information disclosure  limits to premium increases  expedited appeals and grievance procedures  third party review of certain medical decisions  health plan liability  access to specialists  clean claim payment timing  physician collective bargaining rights and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or continue to be under discussion 
new health care reform legislation may require us to change the way we operate our business  which may be costly 
further  although we strive to exercise care in structuring our operations to attempt to comply in all material respects with the laws and regulations applicable to us  government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing such laws and or regulations have in the past asserted and may in the future assert that we or transactions in which we are involved are in violation of these laws  or courts may ultimately interpret such laws in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation 
therefore  it is possible that future legislation and regulation and the interpretation of laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate under the medicaid  medicare and s chip programs and to continue to serve our members and attract new members  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
state regulatory restrictions on our marketing activities may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues  which could have a material adverse effect in our results of operations 
although we rely on direct marketing and sales efforts in a few of our states  the majority of our new members are obtained through voluntary selection and automatic enrollment programs 
all of the states in which we currently operate permit advertising and  in most cases  direct sales but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that are permitted 
for example  the state of georgia does not permit direct sales by medicaid health plans 
in georgia  we advertise our plans  but we rely on member selection and auto assignment of medicaid members into our plans 
similarly  plans participating in the florida medicaid program are prohibited from directly selling their plans to medicaid recipients 
in circumstances where our marketing efforts are prohibited or curtailed  we may incur additional administrative expense in trying to obtain members and our ability to increase or sustain membership could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a significant percentage of our medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory medicaid enrollment in managed care plans 
states may mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care through cms approved plan amendments or  for certain groups  through federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two to five year periods  and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by cms 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver  our membership would likely decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the government to collect premiums  and any inaccuracies in those lists cause states to recoup premium payments from us  which could materially reduce our revenues and results of operations 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our government clients 
a state will require us to reimburse it for premiums that we received from the state based on an eligibility list that it later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program  have been enrolled twice in the same program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
for example  in july  we continued to receive premiums from the state of florida for members that had become eligible for both medicaid and medicare benefits 
once recipients become dually eligible  their premiums are primarily remitted by cms rather than the state 
in this case  the state of florida had not properly reduced the amount of premium it paid to us to reflect that cms was now the primary payor 
our review of all remittance files to identify potential duplicate members  members that should be terminated or members for which we have been paid an incorrect rate may not identify all such members and could result in repayment of premiums in years subsequent to the year in which the revenue was recovered 
in addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid  we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our results of operations would be reduced as a result of the state s failure to pay us for related payments to providers we made and we were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 
we have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums  but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount  if any  of recoupments 
if the amount of any recoupment exceeds our reserves  our revenues could be materially reduced and it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our failure to maintain accreditations could disqualify us from participation in certain state medicaid programs  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of our medicaid contracts require that our plans or subcontracted providers be accredited by independent accrediting organizations that are focused on improving the quality of health care services 
accreditation by aaahc or comparable accreditation is a requirement for participation in the florida medicaid program 
further  florida medicaid plans can only subcontract behavioral health services to a urac accredited organization 
accreditation by ncqa is a requirement for participation in the georgia medicaid managed care program and the hawaii medicaid program requires that participating plans be either ncqa or urac accredited 
our florida health plans are accredited by the aaahc and our georgia health plan is accredited by ncqa 
under the terms of our medicaid contract  we have until january  to obtain ncqa accreditation in hawaii 
failure to maintain our aaahc or urac accreditations in florida or ncqa accreditation in georgia could disqualify us from participation in the florida and georgia medicaid businesses  respectively 
similarly  failure to obtain ncqa accreditation in hawaii by january  could disqualify us from participation in the hawaii medicaid program 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain  or obtain  our ncqa  urac or aaahc accreditations  and the loss of  or failure to obtain  these accreditations could adversely our ability to participate in certain medicaid programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales  or the availability for sale  of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock  of which  were exercisable  at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  as of december   we had outstanding  restricted stock units  which will vest at various times over approximately the next four years 
from time to time  we may issue additional options and restricted stock units to associates  non employee directors  consultants and others pursuant to our equity incentive plans 
provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for a stockholder to elect directors of its choosing the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of applicable delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests  make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that stockholders may consider unfavorable

our corporate headquarters is used in all of our lines of business 
we also lease office space for the administration of our health plans in connecticut  florida  georgia  hawaii  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  new jersey  new york  ohio and texas 
these properties are all in good condition and are well maintained 
we believe these facilities are suitable and provide the appropriate level of capacity for our current operations 
item legal proceedings set forth below is a description of the current status of the investigations  actions and lawsuits arising from or consequential to the restatement and special committee investigation government investigations as previously disclosed  in may  we entered into the dpa with the usao and the florida attorney general s office  resolving previously disclosed investigations by those offices 
under the information filed with the court by the usao pursuant to the dpa  we were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud against the florida medicaid program in connection with reporting of expenditures under certain community behavioral health contracts  and against the florida healthy kids programs  under certain contracts  in violation of usc section the usao recommended to the court that the prosecution of us be deferred for the duration of the dpa 
within five days of the expiration of the dpa the usao will seek dismissal with prejudice of the information  provided we have complied with the dpa 
the term of the dpa is thirty six months  but such term may be reduced by the usao to twenty four months upon consideration of certain factors set forth in the dpa  including our continued remedial actions and compliance with all federal and state health care laws and regulations 

table of contents in accordance with the dpa  the usao has filed with the court a statement of facts relating to this matter 
as a part of the dpa  we have retained a monitor for a period of months from his retention in august the monitor was selected by the usao after consultation with us and is retained at our expense 
in addition  we agreed to continue undertaking remedial measures to ensure full compliance with all federal and state health care laws 
among other things  the monitor will review our compliance with the dpa and all applicable federal and state health care laws  regulations and programs 
the monitor also will review  evaluate and  as necessary  make written recommendations concerning certain of our policies and procedures 
the dpa provides that the monitor will undertake to avoid the disruption of our ordinary business operations or the imposition of unnecessary costs or expenses 
the dpa does not  nor should it be construed to  operate as a settlement or release of any civil or administrative claims for monetary  injunctive or other relief against us  whether under federal  state or local statutes  regulations or common law 
furthermore  the dpa does not operate  nor should it be construed  as a concession that we are entitled to any limitation of our potential federal  state or local civil or administrative liability 
pursuant to the terms of the dpa  we have paid the usao a total of million 
in may  we resolved the previously disclosed investigation by the sec 
under the terms of the consent and final judgment  without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed by the sec  we consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against any future violations of certain specified provisions of the federal securities laws 
in addition  we agreed to pay  in four quarterly installments  a civil penalty in the aggregate amount of million and disgorgement in the amount of one dollar plus post judgment interest  of which the first three payments have been made 
as previously disclosed  we remain engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the civil division and the oig 
management currently estimates that the remaining liability associated with these matters is approximately million  plus interest 
we anticipate these amounts will be payable in installments over a period of four to five years 
in october  the civil division informed us that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
in connection with the ongoing resolution discussions with the civil division  we are addressing the allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  therefore  we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
in addition  we are responding to subpoenas issued by the state of connecticut attorney general s office involving transactions between us and our affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of connecticut s medicaid program 
we have communicated with regulators in states in which our health maintenance organization and insurance operating subsidiaries are domiciled regarding the investigations  and we are cooperating with federal and state regulators and enforcement officials in all of these matters 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any pending investigations might lead to the payment of fines or penalties  the imposition of injunctive relief and or operating restrictions 
class action and derivative lawsuits putative class action complaints were filed in october and in november these putative class actions  entitled eastwood enterprises  llc v 
farha  et al 
and hutton v 
wellcare health plans  inc et al  respectively  were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against us  todd farha  our former chairman and chief executive officer  and paul behrens  our former senior vice president and chief financial officer 
messrs 
farha and behrens were also officers of various subsidiaries of ours 
the eastwood enterprises complaint alleges that the defendants materially misstated our reported financial condition by  among other things  purportedly overstating revenue and understating expenses in amounts unspecified in the pleading in violation of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the hutton complaint alleges that various public statements supposedly issued by defendants were materially misleading because they failed to disclose that we were purportedly operating our business in a potentially illegal and improper manner in violation of applicable federal guidelines and regulations 
the complaint asserts claims under the exchange act 
both complaints seek  among other things  certification as a class action and damages 
the two actions were consolidated  and various parties and law firms filed motions seeking to be designated as lead plaintiff and lead counsel 
in an order issued in march  the court appointed a group of five public pension funds from new mexico  louisiana and chicago the public pension fund group as lead plaintiffs 
in october  an amended consolidated complaint was filed in this class action against us  messrs 
farha and behrens  and adding thaddeus bereday  our former senior vice president and general counsel  as a defendant 
in january  we and certain other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint  arguing  
table of contents among other things  that the complaint failed to allege a material misstatement by defendants with respect to our compliance with marketing and other health care regulations and failed to plead facts raising a strong inference of scienter with respect to all aspects of the purported fraud claim 
the court denied the motion in september and we and the other defendants filed our answer to the amended consolidated complaint in november  and discovery is ongoing 
separately  in october  an action was filed against us in the court of chancery of the state of delaware entitled behrens  et al 
v 
wellcare health plans  inc in which the plaintiffs  messrs 
behrens  bereday  and farha  seek an order requiring us to pay their respective expenses  including attorney fees  in connection with litigation and investigations in which the plaintiffs are involved by reason of their service as our directors and officers 
plaintiffs further challenge our right  prior to advancing such expenses  to first submit their expense invoices to our directors and officers insurance carrier for their preliminary review and evaluation of the adequacy of the description of services in the invoices and of the reasonableness of those expenses 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these claims 
at this time  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries can predict the probable outcome of these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements in respect to these matters 
five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between october and november the first two of these putative shareholder derivative actions  entitled rosky v 
farha  et al 
and rooney v 
farha  et al  respectively  are supposedly brought on behalf of us and were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida 
two additional actions  entitled intermountain ironworkers trust fund v 
farha  et al  and myra kahn trust v 
farha  et al  were filed in circuit court for hillsborough county  florida 
all four of these actions are asserted against all of our directors and former director todd farha except for charles berg  david gallitano  d 
robert graham and glenn d 
steele  jr 
and also name us as a nominal defendant 
a fifth action  entitled irvin v 
behrens  et al  was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida and asserts claims against all of our directors and former director todd farha except charles berg  david gallitano and glenn d 
steele  jr 
and against two of our former officers  paul behrens and thaddeus bereday 
all five actions contend  among other things  that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused us to misrepresent our reported financial results  in amounts unspecified in the pleadings  and seek damages and equitable relief for  among other things  the defendants supposed breach of fiduciary duty  waste and unjust enrichment 
the three actions in federal court have been consolidated 
subsequent to that consolidation  an additional derivative complaint entitled city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement fund v 
farha  et al 
was filed in the same federal court  but thereafter was consolidated with the existing consolidated action 
a motion to consolidate the two state court actions  to which all parties consented  was granted  and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in april in october  amended complaints were filed in the federal court and the state court derivative actions 
in december  we filed substantially similar motions to dismiss both actions  contesting  among other things  the standing of the plaintiffs in each of these derivative actions to prosecute the purported claims in our name 
in an order entered in march in the consolidated federal action  the court denied the motions to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint 
in april  in the consolidated state action  the court denied the motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint 
in april  upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board  the board adopted a resolution forming a special litigation committee  comprised of a newly appointed independent director  to investigate the facts and circumstances underlying the claims asserted in the federal and state derivative cases and to take such action with respect to such claims as the special litigation committee determines to be in our best interests 
in may  the special litigation committee filed in the consolidated federal action a motion to stay the matter until november to allow the special litigation committee to complete its investigation  and following a hearing in may  the court granted that motion and stayed the federal action 
the special litigation committee filed a substantially identical motion in the consolidated state action  and the plaintiffs in that action withdrew their request for a hearing to contest that motion 
also  in october  the judge overseeing the consolidated federal action granted a motion that had been filed by several of the individual defendants to transfer responsibility for the case to the judge within the same court who is overseeing the class action case described in the preceding paragraph 
in november  the special litigation committee filed a report with the court determining  among other things  that we should pursue an action against three of our former officers 
in december  the special litigation committee filed a motion to dismiss the claims against the director defendants  and to realign us as a plaintiff for purposes of pursuing claims against the three former officers 
that motion remains pending 
at this time  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries can predict the probable outcome of these claims 
in addition  derivative actions  by their nature  do not seek to recover damages from the companies on whose behalf the plaintiff shareholders are purporting to act 
other lawsuits and claims separate and apart from the legal matters described above  we are also involved in other legal actions that are in the normal course of our business  some of which seek monetary damages  including claims for punitive damages  which are not covered by insurance 
we currently believe that none of these actions  when finally concluded and determined  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

as a result of the restatement and investigation  we were delayed in filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the form k 
due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k 
we have determined that the claims information that has become available provides additional evidence about conditions that existed with respect to medical benefits payable at the december  balance sheet date and has been considered in accordance with gaap 
consequently  the amounts we recorded for medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense for the year ended december  were based on actual claims paid 
the difference between our actual claims paid for the period and the amount that would have resulted from using our original actuarially determined estimate is approximately million  or a decrease of in the mbr 
thus  medical benefits expense  medical benefits payable and the mbr for the year ended december  include the effect of using actual claims paid

the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements  business and elsewhere in this form k 
overview current financial condition financial impact of government investigations and litigation we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any investigations that remain unresolved and any investigation related litigation or any of the class actions discussed above under part i item legal proceedings will result in our payment of additional fines  penalties or damages  any of which would require us to incur additional expenses and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
furthermore  if as a result of the resolution of the investigations we are subject to operating restrictions  revocation of our licenses  termination of one or more of our contracts and or exclusion from further participation in medicare or medicaid programs  our revenues and net income could be adversely affected 

table of contents as discussed above  we have resolved our previously disclosed matters under investigation by the usao and the state of florida but remain in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the civil division and the oig 
any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by these agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as previously disclosed  we have paid the usao a total of million pursuant to the terms of the dpa 
pursuant to the consent and final judgment  we agreed to pay a penalty of million to the sec  of which million remains to be paid during the first quarter of based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  management estimates that we have a liability of approximately million plus interest associated with the matters remaining under investigation 
we anticipate these amounts will be payable in installments over a period of four to five years 
in accordance with fair value accounting guidance  we discounted the liability and recorded it at its current fair value of approximately million 
this amount remains accrued in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  within the short and long term portions of amounts accrued related to investigation resolution line items 
the final timing  terms and conditions of a resolution of these matters may differ from those currently anticipated  which may result in an adjustment to our recorded amounts 
these adjustments may be material 
we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the civil division or the oig 
we have expended significant financial resources in connection with the investigations and related matters 
since the inception of these investigations through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million for administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  these governmental and company investigations for legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses 
approximately million of these investigation related costs were incurred in  approximately million were incurred in and approximately million were incurred in we expect to continue incurring additional costs in connection with the governmental and company investigations  compliance with the dpa and related matters during its term 
although investigation related costs overall have gradually declined  we can provide no assurance that such costs will not be significant or increase in the future 
these include  among others  anticipated costs associated with the retention of the monitor and implementation of any recommendations  as discussed above  as well as anticipated costs related to the class action lawsuit and efforts of the special litigation committee in connection with the ongoing shareholder derivative actions 
current cash position as of december   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were approximately  million 
as of december   our consolidated investments were approximately million 
as of december   we had unregulated cash of approximately million and unregulated investments of approximately million 
business and financial outlook general economic  political and financial market conditions as a result of economic uncertainty  the states in which we operate are experiencing significant fiscal challenges  which are likely to result in budget deficits 
in light of these budgetary challenges  the medicaid segment premiums we receive likely will not keep pace with anticipated medical expense increases 
while the economic downturn may increase the number of medicaid recipients under current eligibility criteria  states may revise the eligibility criteria to reduce the number of people who are eligible for our plans 
in february  cms published preliminary results of a study designed to assess the degree of coding pattern differences between original medicare and medicare advantage and the extent to which any such differences could be appropriately addressed by an adjustment to risk scores 
cms s study of risk scores for medicare populations from through found that medicare advantage member risk scores increased substantially more than the risk scores for the general medicare fee for service population 
cms found that the overall risk scores of stayers a cms term referring to those persons who were enrolled either in the same medicare advantage plan or in original medicare during the study periods in medicare advantage increased more than those of original medicare stayers 
accordingly  in the advance notice of methodological changes for calendar year for medicare advantage capitation rates and part d payment policies  cms summarized findings from its analysis of risk scores over the time period and proposed to apply a coding intensity adjustment to contracts whose disease scores for stayers exceeded fee for service by twice the industry average 
cms proposed to apply an adjustment that was calculated based on those contracts that fell above this threshold 
in response to the advance notice  cms received a significant number of comments on the proposed adjustment for medicare advantage coding differences  most of which expressed disagreement with the view that cms had identified differences in coding patterns between medicare advantage and fee for service medicare 
cms then decided not to make a coding intensity adjustment for for calendar year  a negative coding intensity adjustment factor of will apply to all managed care plans 
the coding intensity adjustment factor would be applied to beneficiaries and risk scores  resulting in a decrease in our medicare revenue and membership 
furthermore  federal budgetary challenges or policy changes could result in rates that do not keep pace with anticipated medical expense increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our performance in the medicaid or medicare segments 

table of contents in addition  increasing market volatility and the tightening of the credit markets have significantly limited our ability to access external capital  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy 
however  we continue to pursue financing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash  including seeking dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries and accessing the public and private equity and debt markets 
government funding continues to be a significant challenge to our business  particularly in light of the current economic conditions 
because the health care services we offer are through government sponsored programs  our profitability is largely dependent on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints 
health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past as states continue to look at medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings  and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to medicaid health plans 
in particular  we are experiencing pressure on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
in  florida implemented medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to provide services in certain counties and programs 
as a result  we withdrew from the medicaid reform programs effective july   which resulted in a loss of approximately  members 
new or proposed legislation in georgia related to payment of claims  program design  eligibility determination and provider contracting may negatively impact revenues and administrative expenses for the plan in and beyond 
further  continued economic slowdowns in florida and georgia  as well as other states  could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues 
in january  the obama administration took office 
although the obama administration and congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system  the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed  in part  by reductions in the payments made to medicare advantage and other government programs 
similarly  although congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  increases federal funding to the s chip and president obama signed the arra that provides funding for  among other things  state medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts  because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives  the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how medicaid and s chip funds will be used  we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business 
it is possible that the ultimate impact of these initiatives could be negative 
execution of business strategy to achieve our business strategy  we continue to look for economically viable opportunities to expand our business within our existing markets  expand our current service territory and develop new product initiatives 
we also are  however  evaluating various strategic alternatives  which may include entering new lines of business or markets  exiting existing lines of business or markets and or disposing of assets depending on various factors  including changes in our business and regulatory environment  competitive position and financial resources 
we also continue to rationalize our operations to enhance the likelihood that our ongoing business is profitable 
to the extent that we expand our current service territory or product offerings  we expect to generate additional revenues 
on the other hand  if we decide to exit certain markets  such as our exit from certain florida counties in and the exit from pffs  our revenues and net income could decrease 
we currently do not foresee large  one time opportunities to expand our business  such as prior efforts like the launch of pdps in and the privatization of georgia medicaid in we continue to focus our resources on strengthening compliance and operating capabilities 
these factors  when combined with the rationalization of our operations and the operational challenges we face  will cause us to be unable to sustain the rapid growth we have achieved in the recent past 
membership and trends we provide managed care services targeted exclusively to government sponsored health care programs  focused on medicaid and medicare  including prescription drug plans and health plans for families  children  and the aged  blind and disabled 
as of december   we served approximately  members 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 

table of contents we currently anticipate that our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal years will be lower than in prior periods due to the previously discussed exit from our ma pffs business and certain florida counties 
as the composition of our membership base continues to change as the result of programmatic  competitive  regulatory  benefit design  economic or other changes  we expect a corresponding change to our premium revenue  costs and margins  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  profitability and results of operations 
during  cms imposed a marketing sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of  and enrollment into  all lines of our medicare business from march until the sanction was released in november 
cms released us from the sanction in november  in time to begin enrolling beneficiaries for the contract year on november   which is the first day that plans may begin enrolling participants 
however  as a result of the sanction  we were not eligible to receive auto assignments of lis dual eligible beneficiaries into our pdp program  for january enrollment 
we are eligible to receive auto assignments of these members in subsequent months  although such assignments are expected to be at levels well below the level we typically experience in the month of january 
we did not renew our contracts to participate in the ma pffs program in or beyond 
our ma pffs business represents approximately of our medicare segment revenue and of our total premium revenue for the year ended december   accordingly our exit of this line of business will cause our medicare revenue and consolidated net income to decline in we anticipate that the withdrawal from the ma pffs business may provide approximately million to million of excess capital in the insurance companies that underwrite this line of business  which we may be able to dividend to our unregulated subsidiaries 
however  we currently believe we will not have the benefit of these dividends prior to  if at all 
any dividend of surplus capital of our applicable insurance subsidiaries  including the timing and amount of any dividend  would be subject to a variety of factors  which could materially change the aforementioned timing and amount 
those factors include the ultimate financial performance of the ma pffs business as well as the financial performance of other lines of business that operate in those insurance subsidiaries  approval from regulatory agencies and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements 
for example  our current estimate of million to million has declined from previous estimates of million to million  because the financial performance of these insurance subsidiaries worsened during in  we will continue to serve our current members in our pdp program in states and the district of columbia  and our ma ccp in states 
for  we will be below the cms benchmarks in regions  including the following eight new regions arizona  central new england connecticut  massachusetts  rhode island and vermont  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  new york  oklahoma and virginia 
as mentioned previously  during the cms sanction period  we were precluded from marketing our plans and enrolling new members  including low income subsidy auto assignments  into our stand alone pdps 
in addition  as a result of the sanction  we were not eligible to be auto assigned lis dual eligible beneficiaries for january membership 
accordingly  our revenues generated from our stand alone pdps may decrease significantly in with the sanctions resolved  we became eligible for new voluntary enrollment for january  and we became eligible for lis auto assigned membership beginning in february unrelated to the cms sanctions  we decided to exit the medicare pdp program in wisconsin for  and auto assigned pdp membership in wisconsin will be re assigned to other plans 
basis of presentation the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows include accounts of ours and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
segments we have two reportable business segments medicaid and medicare 
medicaid medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons  and is state operated and implemented  although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments 
for a more detailed description of our medicaid segment  please see item business our segments 
as of december   we had approximately  medicaid members 
the following table summarizes our medicaid segment membership by line of business as of december  and 
table of contents medicaid membership as of december  medicaid tanf s chip ssi and abd fhp total for purposes of our medicaid segment  we define our customer as the state and related governmental agencies that have common control over the contracts under which we operate in that particular state 
in and  we had two customers  the states of florida and georgia  from which we received or more of our medicaid segment premiums revenues 
medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits  and is funded by congress and administered by cms 
for a more detailed description of our medicare segment  please see item business our segments 
as of december   we had approximately  medicare members 
medicare membership as of december  medicare pdp medicare advantage total in our medicare segment  we have just one customer  cms  from which we receive substantially all of our medicare segment premium revenue 
health and prescription drug plans premiums we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare 
the premiums we receive for each member varies according to the specific government program and may vary according to many other factors  including the member s geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
the premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period 
these premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period 
the premium payments we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
from time to time  our regulators require us to reimburse them for premiums we received based on an eligibility list that the regulator later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
cms employs a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all medicare plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for medicare members with predictably higher costs 
we collect claim and encounter data from providers  who we rely on to properly code and document this data  and submit the necessary diagnosis data and coding to cms within the prescribed deadlines and cms determines the final risk score based on its interpretation and acceptance of the data we provided 
the claims and encounter data provided to determine the risk score are subject to subsequent audit by cms 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to cms that were previously received by us 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund  this refund could be significant in the future  which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that cms requires repayment from us 
see risk factors cms s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and results of operations difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional risks associated with a current cms audit of one of our plans 
these periodic premium rate adjustments  risk adjusted premiums and member eligibility determinations  adversely impact our ability to predict what our future revenues will be under each of our government contracts even when we believe membership will remain constant 
for further detail about the cms reimbursement methodology under the pdp program  see critical accounting policies below 

table of contents services coverage medicaid the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve our various constituencies effectively in the communities we serve 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs  and generally must receive a referral from their pcp in order to receive health care from a specialist  such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicare through our medicare advantage plans  we also cover a wide spectrum of medical services 
we provide additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our medicare advantage plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ma ccps are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs 
ma ccp members may see an out of network specialist if they receive a referral from their pcp and may pay incremental cost sharing 
ma pffs plans are open access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the medicare program  is willing to bill us for reimbursement and accepts our terms and conditions 
we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid  or d snps  in most of our markets 
d snps are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
the medicare part d benefit  which provides prescription drug benefits  is available to medicare advantage enrollees as well as original medicare enrollees 
we offer part d coverage as stand alone pdps and as a component of many of our medicare advantage plans 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
ma pffs beneficiaries can join a ma pffs plan that has part d drug coverage or join a plan without such coverage and choose either to obtain a drug benefit from a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ma ccps can join a plan with part d coverage or forego part d coverage 
medical benefits expense our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide  which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members 
our profitability depends on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive 
our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee for service as well as risk sharing arrangements  pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided 
capitation payments represented  and of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 

table of contents we use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense  including payment methods to providers  referral requirements  quality and disease management programs  reinsurance and member co payments and premiums for some of our medicare plans 
national health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate  however  relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  levels of use of health care services  competitive pressures  hospital costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively 
one of our primary tools for measuring profitability is our mbr  the ratio of our medical benefits expense to the premiums we receive 
changes in the mbr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims ibnr 
estimation of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable is our most significant critical accounting estimate 
see critical accounting policies below 
we use mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what health care plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of health care providers 
although mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may  for example  be willing to enter into new geographical markets and or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs and for other reasons 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable  and goodwill and intangible assets are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
our medicare advantage and pdp contracts with cms generally have terms of one year 
we recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible or that will be returned based on historical trends  anticipated or actual mbrs  and other factors 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned 
historically  the allowance has not been significant relative to premium revenue 
the payment we receive monthly from cms for our pdp program generally represents our bid amount for providing prescription drug insurance coverage 
we recognize premium revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as unearned premiums in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amounts that have not been received by the end of the period remain on the balance sheet classified as premium receivables 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our customers 
from time to time  the states or cms require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state or cms later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category  different program  or belong to a different plan other than ours 
we record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity  if deemed material 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number of and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate  the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
changes to member retroactivity adjustment estimates had a minimal impact on adjustments recorded during the periods presented 
our government contracts establish monthly rates per member  but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age  working status or medical history 
cms employs a risk adjustment model to determine the premium amount for each member 
this model apportions premiums paid to all ma plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
under the risk adjustment model  the settlement payment is based on each member s preceding year s medical diagnosis data 
the final settlement payment amount under the risk adjustment model is made in august of the following year  allowing for the majority of medical claim run out 
as a result of this process  our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 

table of contents the cms risk adjustment model pays more for medicare members with predictably higher costs 
diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us 
we collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustments to revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms  and record such adjustments in our results of operations 
however  due to the variability of the assumptions that we use in our estimates  the actual results may differ from the amounts that management estimated 
if our estimates are materially incorrect  it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between the amounts that we have recorded and the revenues that we actually received 
the claims and encounter data submitted to cms to determine our risk adjusted premium are subject to audit by cms subsequent to the annual settlement 
cms has begun a program to perform audits of selected ma plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each ma member 
our florida hmo contract has been selected by cms for audit for the contract year and we anticipate that cms will conduct additional audits of other contract and contract years on an ongoing basis 
the cms audit of this data involves a review of a sample of provider medical records for the contract under audit 
we are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audit that is underway or that may be conducted in the future 
we are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that cms may make  based on the audit of our plan and others  will cause us to change our revenue estimation process 
at this time  we do not know whether cms will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of original medicare and other ma plan providers  and how  if at all  cms will extrapolate its findings to the entire contract 
however  it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur  and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows  possibly in and beyond 
other amounts included in this balance as a reduction of premium revenue represent the return of premium associated with certain of our medicaid contracts 
these contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense  and to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense  we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense 
we estimate the amounts due to the state as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contract with the applicable state agency 
estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the ibnr cost of medical benefits 
we contract with various health care providers for the provision of certain medical care services to our members and generally compensate those providers on a fee for service or capitated basis or pursuant to certain risk sharing arrangements 
capitation represents fixed payments generally on a pmpm basis to participating physicians and other medical specialists as compensation for providing comprehensive health care services 
generally  by the terms of most of our capitation agreements  capitation payments we make to capitated providers alleviate any further obligation we have to pay the capitated provider for the actual medical expenses of the member 
participating physician capitation payments for the years ended december   and were approximately  and of total medical benefits expense  respectively 
medical benefits expense has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratory and pharmacy 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated awaiting payment disbursement and estimates for ibnr 
the medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be the most significant estimate included in our financial statements 
we historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
our policy is to record management s best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time 
this estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  which vary by business segment 
these standard actuarial methodologies include using  among other factors  contractual requirements  historic utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefits changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns  maturity of lines of business and changes in membership 
the factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies  discussed above  would allow for this inherent variability  which could result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
conversely  during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature  we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience 
with more reliable data  we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts  therefore  we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid 

table of contents in developing our estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our membership in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee for service basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the trend in medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
also included in medical benefits payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
we record reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 
changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the total medical benefits payable balances as of december   and as of december  of total of total of total dollars in thousands claims adjudicated  but not yet paid ibnr total medical benefits payable 
table of contents medical benefits payable includes reserves for claims adjudicated  but not yet paid  an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  reserves for medically related administrative costs and other liabilities  including estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable for the following periods year ended december  dollars in thousands balances as of beginning of period medical benefits incurred related to current period prior periods total medical benefits paid related to current period prior periods total balances as of end of period changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods 
medical benefits payable recorded at december   and developed favorably by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these prior period developments were primarily attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  which is included as part of the assumptions  and favorable variances between actual experience and key assumptions relating to trend factors and completion factors for claims incurred in prior years 
the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year 
accordingly  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period 
we consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate medical benefits payable within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the medical benefits payable be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
as we establish the liability for each year  we ensure that our assumptions appropriately consider moderately adverse conditions 
when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined appropriate to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims  we do not consider that offset amount as having any impact on net income during the period 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
intangible assets include provider networks  membership contracts  trademarks  non compete agreements  state contracts  licenses and permits 
our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to years 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks 
we evaluate the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets using both the income and market approach 
in doing so  we must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
an impairment loss is recognized for goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of such costs exceeds its fair value 
we select the second quarter of each year for our annual impairment test  which generally coincides with the finalization of state and federal contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process 
accordingly  we have assessed the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets and believe that such assets have not been impaired as of december  
table of contents based on the general economic conditions and outlook during  we performed a similar analysis of the underlying valuation of goodwill at december  based on the valuation performed  we determined that the goodwill associated with our medicare reporting unit was impaired 
the impairment to our medicare reporting unit was due to  among other things  the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation  and the resulting effects on our future membership trends 
in  we recorded an expense of million to goodwill impairment  and a corresponding amount to goodwill to reflect its fair value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we have evaluated the intangible assets in connection with the pffs exit in  which primarily consisted of state licenses for the insurance companies 
as we continue to use these company licenses for other lines of business and the licenses have a market value  we determined that these assets have not been impaired as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data  expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each period indicated

the increase in medicaid segment revenue is primarily due to the inclusion of operations for the hawaii abd program  which was not present for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of a loss of membership in florida and the ohio abd program  with the remaining change due to a change in the demographic mix of our members

the medicaid mbr for the twelve months ended december   was compared to as adjusted for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in mbr is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the hawaii business as well as premium rate increases during the past year that were below our medical cost trend  or in some cases  rate decreases

net loss income for the year ended december  in millions  except per share data net loss income net loss income per diluted share liquidity and capital resources overview cash generating activities our business consists of operations conducted by our regulated subsidiaries  including hmos and insurance subsidiaries  and our non regulated subsidiaries 
the primary sources of cash for our regulated subsidiaries include premium revenue  investment income and capital contributions made by us to our regulated subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus 
our regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of medical expenses  management fees to our non regulated third party administrator subsidiary the tpa and direct administrative costs  which are not covered by the agreement with the tpa  such as selling expenses and legal costs 
we refer collectively to the cash and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and regulated investments  respectively 
the primary sources of cash for our non regulated subsidiaries are management fees received from our regulated subsidiaries  investment income and dividends from our regulated subsidiaries 
our non regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of administrative costs not charged to our regulated subsidiaries for corporate functions  including administrative services related to claims payment  member and provider services and information technology 
other primary uses include capital contributions made by our non regulated subsidiaries to our regulated subsidiaries and the repayment of our credit facility 
we refer collectively to the cash and investment balances available in our non regulated subsidiaries as unregulated cash and unregulated investments  respectively 
cash positions at december  and  cash and cash equivalents were  million and  million  respectively 
we also had short term investments of million and million at december  and  respectively

table of contents during  three of our florida regulated subsidiaries declared and paid dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million 
on december   the same three florida regulated subsidiaries of ours  declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  of which two dividends were paid in december and one dividend which was paid in january initiatives to increase our unregulated cash we are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash 
some of these initiatives include  but are not limited to  consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and accessing the credit markets 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for dividends to our non regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries 
in addition to dividends  our strategies include accessing the public and private debt and equity markets and potentially selling assets 
our ability to obtain financing has been and continues to be materially and negatively affected by a number of factors 
the recent turmoil in the credit markets  market volatility  the deterioration in the soundness of certain financial institutions and general adverse economic conditions have caused the cost of prospective debt financings to increase considerably 
these circumstances have materially adversely affected liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings unattractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
we also believe the uncertainty created by the ongoing state and federal investigations is affecting our ability to obtain financing 
in light of the current and evolving credit market crisis and the uncertainty created by the ongoing investigations  we may not be able to obtain financing 
even if we are able to obtain financing under these circumstances  the cost to us likely will be high and the terms and conditions likely will be onerous 
auction rate securities as of december   all of our long term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven   or days 
as of the date of this form k  auctions have failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven   or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities without significant loss  and we currently believe these securities are not impaired  primarily due to government guarantees or municipal bond insurance  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our auction rate securities until market stability is restored with respect to these securities 
investigation and litigation related costs we have expended significant financial resources in connection with the ongoing investigations and related matters 
since the inception of the investigations through december   we have incurred approximately million for administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  these governmental and company investigations for legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses 
approximately million and million were incurred in the three months and year ended december   respectively 
in addition  we have paid million to resolve matters with certain government agencies  of which million was paid during we currently estimate that we will pay approximately million in installments over a period of four to five years to resolve matters with the civil division and the oig 
the final timing  terms and conditions of a civil resolution may differ from those current anticipated  which may results in an adjustment to our recorded amounts 
these adjustments may be material 

table of contents we may be required to pay significant damages or other amounts in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of the shareholder actions against us 
a substantial amount of these costs will not be covered by  or may exceed the limits of  our insurance 
we are unable to provide an estimate or range of amounts that we may pay  if any  to resolve the outstanding shareholder actions 
if we were required to pay a significant amount to resolves these matters  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect to continue incurring additional administrative costs in connection with the governmental and company investigations  defending the class action lawsuits against us  compliance with the dpa and other related matters into although costs related to the investigations have declined in recent periods  we can provide no assurance that such costs will not be significant or increase in the future 
these costs include  among others  costs associated with the retention of the monitor and implementation of any recommendations as well as costs related to the class action lawsuit and efforts of the special litigation committee in connection with the ongoing shareholder derivative actions 
regulatory capital and restrictions on dividends and management fees each of our hmo and insurance company subsidiaries is licensed in the markets in which it operates and is subject to the rules  regulations and oversight by the applicable state doi in the areas of licensing and solvency 
each of our health and prescription drug plans is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed  which describes our hmo s and insurance companies capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  each of our subsidiaries is selected to undergo periodic examinations and reviews by the applicable state to review our operational and financial assertions 
the plans that we operate generally must obtain approval from or provide notice to the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions  such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds or paying dividends to a related party  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any other change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum statutory net worth in an amount determined by statute or regulation and we may only invest in types of investments approved by the state 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum  or rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic and are administered by the states 
as of december   our connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  ohio  texas and pffs operations are subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized company action level  or cal  which represents the amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of the required cal or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum net worth may change over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  new york enacted regulations that increase the reserve requirement by over an eight year period 
in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members 
for example  our ohio hmo is required to maintain required statutory capital at an rbc level of of cal 
moreover  as we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
at december   our consolidated rbc ratio for these states is estimated to be over which is in excess of the required cal of 
however  two of our subsidiaries were individually below the required cal at december  these two subsidiaries underwrote our pffs product and one also underwrote our products in hawaii 
as we are no longer offering pffs plans  the amount of rbc required is substantially reduced in and we anticipate that these two subsidiaries will be in compliance in 
table of contents in addition  our medicaid and s chip activities are regulated by each state s department of health or equivalent agency  and our medicare activities are regulated by cms 
these agencies typically require demonstration of the same capabilities mentioned above and perform periodic audits of performance  usually annually 
state enforcement authorities  including state attorneys general and medicaid fraud control units  have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry  including health insurers and managed care organizations 
we routinely respond to requests for information from these entities and  more generally  we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business 
for a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings  see part item legal proceedings 
at december  and  all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents  money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and us government securities 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
overview of cash flow activities for the years ended december   and our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operations net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operations the net cash inflow from operations for the years ended december   and was primarily due to increased revenues from increased membership and changes in the receivables and liabilities due to timing of cash receipts and payments 
because we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment for the related medical care costs  our cash typically has increased during periods of premium revenue growth

commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations 
payments due to period contractual obligations at december  total less than year years years more than years in millions operating leases purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefit total we have resolved our matters under investigation by the usao and the state of florida but remain in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the civil division and the oig 
pursuant to the consent and final judgment  we agreed to pay a penalty of million to the sec  of which million remains to be paid 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  management estimates that we have a liability of approximately million plus interest associated with the matters remaining under investigation 
we anticipate these amounts will be payable in installments over a period of four to five years 
in accordance with fair value accounting guidance  we discounted the liability and recorded it at its current fair value of approximately million 
this amount is accrued in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  within the short and long term portions of amounts accrued related to investigation resolution line items 
the final timing  terms and conditions of a resolution of these matters may differ from those currently anticipated  which may result in a material adjustment to our recorded amounts 
we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the civil division or the oig 
in addition  putative class action complaints were filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors in october and november  alleging  among other things  numerous violations of securities laws 
at this time  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries can predict the probable outcome of these claims 
in addition  derivative actions  by their nature  do not seek to recover damages from the companies on whose behalf the plaintiff shareholders are purporting to act 
we are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party  however  we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance related to improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements

table of contents in december  the fasb issued an update to codify standards in the authoritative guidance it previously issued in june  which addressed the modification of financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities vie 
this update requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessments of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie

in august  the fasb issued authoritative guidance surrounding the fair value measurements and disclosures of liabilities 
this guidance provides clarification in circumstances where a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure the fair value of the liability using either the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique  such as a present value calculation or the amount that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability

in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to modify financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities by addressing the effects on certain provisions of previously issued guidance on the consolidation of a vie  as a result of eliminating the qualifying special purpose entity spe concept in accounting for transfers of financial assets  and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of previously issued guidance on vies  including those in which the accounting and disclosures do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
this guidance shall be effective as of january   our first annual reporting period beginning after november  earlier application is prohibited 
the adoption of this guidance is not currently expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance modifying the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
the fasb undertook this project to address practices that have developed since the issuance of previous guidance concerning the accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  that are not consistent with the original intent and key requirements of that statement and concerns of financial statement users that many of the financial assets and related obligations that have been derecognized should continue to be reported in the financial statements of transferors 
this guidance must be applied as of january   the beginning of our first annual reporting period after november  earlier application is prohibited 
this guidance must also be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
additionally  on and after the effective date  the concept of a qualifying spe is no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  a formerly qualifying spe should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
if the evaluation on the effective date results in consolidation  the reporting entity should apply the transition guidance provided in the pronouncement that requires consolidation

table of contents in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments otti modifying previous otti guidance for debt securities through increased consistency in the timing of impairment recognition and enhanced disclosures related to the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold 
in addition  increased disclosures are required for both debt and equity securities regarding expected cash flows  credit losses  and an aging of securities with unrealized losses 
we adopted this guidance during the second quarter of  as required 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires fair value disclosures for financial instruments that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
prior to the issuance of this guidance  the fair values of those assets and liabilities were disclosed only once each year 
we now disclose this information on a quarterly basis  providing quantitative and qualitative information about fair value estimates for all financial instruments not measured in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
we adopted this guidance during the second quarter of  as required 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance in regard to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are considered not orderly 
this guidance specifically clarifies the methodology used to determine fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
the guidance also reaffirms the objective of a fair value measurement  which is to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction 
it also reaffirms the need to use judgment to determine if a formerly active market has become inactive  as well as to determine fair values when markets have become inactive 
this guidance was adopted and applied prospectively during the second quarter of  as required

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had investments classified as long term in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we also had restricted investments of million and million  at december  and  respectively  which consist principally of restricted deposits in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months as well as longer term bonds with floating interest rates that are considered available for sale 
restricted assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury instruments deposited or pledged to state agencies in accordance with state rules and regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of their short term nature  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by less than million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million
