overview in  we maintained solid profitability and high cash generation despite uncertain and challenging economic conditions 
additionally  the january amendments to our napm contracts for telephone number portability services in the united states provided us with enhanced visibility and reliability for a substantial portion of our total revenue through june during  we further positioned ourselves for growth through innovation  especially in the world of internet protocol  or ip 
for example  our amended contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states allow for increased use of our innovative services  and enable us to help the telecommunications industry meet its emerging needs for ip functionality 
to this end  in may  as contemplated by our amended contracts to provide telephone number portability services  our customers adopted and implemented certain ip fields and functionality for voice  short messaging service  or sms  and multi media messaging service  or mms 
in addition  we strengthened our sales and distribution capabilities in our ultra services  which furthers our global market reach 
we continued to experience increased demand for our telephone portability services in the united states and our internet domain name services during our total revenue for was million  a slight decrease of as compared to our revenue reflects an increase of from services provided outside of our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states 
this increase was driven by increased internet traffic and increased demand for our secure  reliable and scalable ultra services  which grew over however  this increase was offset by our anticipated decrease in annual revenue due to the january amended pricing terms under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states 
under these contracts  our revenue decreased despite a growth in transaction volume of over during  the effective price per transaction was  compared to for in our ngm business and areas of our clearinghouse business  we have continued to drive cost efficiencies 
during  we extended our ngm restructuring plan first announced in december to more appropriately allocate resources to our key mobile instant messaging initiatives 
we plan to relocate some of our operations and support functions to more cost effective geographies while maintaining access to skilled labor pools 
the growing demand for our services  the recurring nature of our revenue streams and our strategic cost management efforts facilitated our profitability and strong cash flows in as a result of the increased demand for our services and our focus on cost management  our cash flows from operations for the year ended december  were million 
this resulted in total cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of million as of december  our company we provide the communications industry and enterprise customers with critical technology services that solve their addressing  interoperability and infrastructure needs 
these services are used by csps and enterprise customers to manage a range of their technical and operating requirements  including addressing 
we enable csps and enterprises to use critical  shared addressing resources  such as telephone numbers  internet top level domain names  and us common short codes 
interoperability 
we enable csps to exchange and share critical operating data so that communications originating on one provider s network can be delivered and received on the network of another csp 
we also facilitate order management and work flow processing among csps 
infrastructure and other 
we enable csps to more efficiently manage changes in their own networks by centrally managing certain critical data they use to route communications over their own networks 
we derive a substantial portion of our annual revenue on a transaction basis  most of which is derived from long term contracts 
our costs and expenses consist of cost of revenue  sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization  and restructuring charges 
cost of revenue includes all direct materials  direct labor  and those indirect costs related to the generation of revenue such as indirect labor  outsourced services  materials and supplies and facilities cost 
our primary cost of revenue is related to personnel costs associated with service implementation  product maintenance  customer deployment and customer care  including salaries  stock based compensation and other personnel related expense 
in addition  cost of revenue includes costs relating to developing modifications and enhancements of our existing technology and services  as well as royalties paid related to our us common short code services and registry gateway services 
cost of revenue also includes our information technology and systems department  including network costs  data center maintenance  database management  data processing costs and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs  such as salaries  sales commissions  travel  stock based compensation  and other personnel related expense  costs associated with attending and sponsoring trade shows  facilities costs  professional fees  costs of marketing programs  such as internet and print  including product branding  market analysis and forecasting  and customer relationship management 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  stock based compensation and other personnel related expense  contractor costs  and the costs of facilities  computer and support services used in service and technology development 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  stock based compensation  and other personnel related expense  for our executive  administrative  legal  finance and human resources functions 
general and administrative expense also includes facilities  support services and professional services fees 
depreciation and amortization relates to amortization of identifiable intangibles  and the depreciation of our property and equipment  including our network infrastructure and facilities related to our services 
restructuring charges relate to the termination of certain employees and reduction in or closure of leased facilities in some of our international locations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation could be materially affected 
see item a of this report  risk factors  for certain matters that may bear on our results of operations 
revenue recognition we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with napm  an industry group that represents all telecommunications service providers in the united states 
in and  we recognized revenue under our contracts with napm primarily on a per transaction basis 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under these contracts were determined by the total number of transactions  and these fees were billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share was based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenues of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
under our contracts  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
in january  we amended our seven regional contracts with napm under which we provide telephone number portability and other clearinghouse services to csps in the united states 
these amendments provide for an annual fixed fee pricing model under which the annual fixed fee  or base fee  was set at million in and is subject to an annual price escalator of in subsequent years 
the amendments also provide for a fixed credit of million in  million in and million in  which will be applied to reduce the base fee for the applicable year 
additional credits of up to million annually in  and may be triggered if the customers reach certain levels of aggregate telephone number inventories and adopt and implement certain internet protocol  or ip  fields and functionality 
to the extent any available additional credits expire unused  they will be recognized in revenue at that time 
during  our customers adopted and implemented the ip fields and functionality  and earned million of the additional credits as a result 
however  our customers did not reach the levels of aggregate telephone number inventories required to earn additional credits and as a result  million of additional revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of the amendments also enable our customers to earn credits if volume of transactions in a given year is above or below the contractually established volume range for that year 
the determination of credits earned based on transaction volume is done annually at the end of the year and these credits are applied to the following year s invoices 
there were no credits earned in by our customers for transaction volumes above or below the contractually established volume range for we determine the fixed and determinable fee under the amended contracts on an annual basis and recognize such fee on a straight line basis over twelve months 
for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represents the base fee of million reduced by the million fixed credit and million of available additional credits 
we record the fixed and determinable fee amongst addressing  interoperability and infrastructure based on the relative volume of transactions in each of these service offerings processed during the applicable period 
in  pricing under our contracts with napm was per transaction regardless of transaction volume 
during  per transaction pricing under the contracts with napm was derived on a straight line basis using an effective rate calculation formula based on annualized transaction volume between million and million 
for annualized transaction volumes less than or equal to million  the price per transaction was equal to a flat rate of per transaction 
for annualized volumes greater than or equal to million  the price per transaction was equal to a flat rate of per transaction 
for the year ended december   the weighted average per transaction price was 
during  the effective price per transaction was calculated by dividing the ratable portion of the fixed and determinable fee by the number of transactions during the corresponding period 
for the year ended december   the effective price per transaction under the contracts with napm was 
for more information regarding how we recognize revenue for each of our service categories  please see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
service level standards pursuant to certain of our private commercial contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that required service levels that would trigger such a penalty have not been met  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
restructuring in december  we announced a restructuring plan for our ngm business segment  involving the termination of certain employees and reduction in or closure of leased facilities in some of our international locations 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs and million in lease and facilities exit costs for the year ended december  in august  we announced the extension of the restructuring plan to include further headcount reductions and the closure of certain facilities 
we anticipate that the restructuring plan will be completed by the end of the second quarter of we recognized a charge of million in severance and related costs and million in lease and facility exit costs in the year ended december  in connection with this plan 
in addition to the restructuring charges recorded in and  we expect to incur additional pre tax cash restructuring charges of approximately million to million  consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs of approximately million to million  and lease and facility exit costs of approximately million 
these restructuring costs include estimated costs for leased facilities that are no longer being used 
this accrual is equal to the present value of the minimum future lease payments under our contractual lease obligations  offset by the present value of the estimated sublease income  whether or not we intend to sublease the facility 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we may be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
in october  we adopted a plan to relocate certain operations and support functions to louisville  kentucky 
we estimate we will incur approximately million to million of employee severance and related costs through the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to severance and related costs under this plan 
as of december   our accrued restructuring liability was million  including million and million of liabilities relating to our clearinghouse and ngm segments  respectively 
as of december   our total accrued restructuring liability associated with severance and related costs was million  including million and million of liabilities related to our clearinghouse and ngm segments  respectively 
the total minimum lease payments attributable to our vacated facilities were million  net of anticipated sublease payments  and include million and million relating to our clearinghouse and ngm segments  respectively 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of the relevant leases  which range from three months to four years 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions 
in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may have occurred 
for purposes of our annual impairment test  we have identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units  our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit 
fair value of each reporting unit is determined using both an income approach and market approach 
to assist in the process of determining whether a goodwill impairment exists  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
we also may obtain appraisals from external advisors 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value include market penetration  anticipated growth rates  and risk adjusted discount rates for the income approach  as well as the selection of comparable companies and comparable transactions for the market approach 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for each of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
specifically  for our ngm reporting unit as of october   the annual testing date  the estimated fair value exceeded our carrying value by approximately 
the assumptions and estimates used by management to value the ngm reporting unit have a high degree of subjectivity due to the early stage of operations and the emerging nature of mobile instant messaging technology  and are thus more likely to change over time 
in addition  because relatively few carriers control a substantial portion of the end users who will drive the success of mobile instant messaging  the activities of ngm s largest customers could have a significant impact on these assumptions and estimates 
our assumptions and estimates regarding our ngm reporting unit could change due to further delays resulting from changes in strategy by participants in the mobile instant messaging market  lack of effective marketing efforts to promote mobile instant messaging to end users  unforeseen changes in the market or other factors 
the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of our ngm reporting unit included a cash flow projections  which include growth assumptions for forecasted revenue and expenses  b a terminal multiple of times based upon the expected proceeds resulting from a sale of the ngm business unit at the end of the cash flow projection period  c a discount rate of  which was based upon the ngm business unit s weighted cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the annual goodwill impairment test  d selection of comparable companies and transactions used in the market approach  and e our assumptions in weighting the results of the income approach and market approach valuation techniques 
a change in these assumptions would have had a significant effect on the determined fair value of our ngm reporting unit and could have resulted in an estimated fair value of our ngm reporting unit that was less than our ngm reporting unit s carrying value 
if we had performed the second step of comparing the carrying value of our ngm s reporting unit s assigned goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill  using a theoretical purchase price allocation  the outcome of our analysis might have resulted in a material goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of one of our reporting units to fall below that of its carrying value  resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million and million  respectively  in goodwill for our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit 
in  changes to our key assumptions in determining the fair value of our ngm reporting unit resulted in two goodwill impairment charges 
specifically  late in the first quarter of  there were changes in the market and identified customer related events that caused us to change certain of our assumptions underlying the financial forecast relating to ngm  most notably our assumptions about end user adoption rates 
projections of future cash flows for the ngm business are particularly sensitive to these assumptions 
as a result  when the events of the first quarter caused us to reduce our projections relating to the rate at which new end users would begin using mobile instant messaging  those changed assumptions had a dramatic impact on our financial forecast for that business and the estimated fair value of our ngm business 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to lower than anticipated adoption rates and the resulting underperformance of our ngm business  as well as the manner in which the mobile data market had evolved and was evolving  we added new leadership and conducted a strategic evaluation of our ngm business 
the goal of this strategic evaluation was to position ngm for future long term success in the mobile instant messaging market 
during the course of this evaluation  we conducted a thorough review of the ngm business  including our experience in the mobile instant messaging market since our acquisition of followap inc in november  the current state of the mobile instant messaging market and related markets  the performance of our competitors for these services and consumer demand 
following this evaluation  we decided to change the direction of our ngm business to offer enhanced end user experiences  faster deployments  and greater operator control  all of which would be delivered from a common infrastructure 
associated with this decision  we began to realign the ngm organization  and we announced a restructuring plan in december to leverage our existing operational resources to support our ngm initiatives 
in addition  consistent with our new strategic direction  we began development of a new technology platform that would serve as the common infrastructure for each of our ngm customers 
this repositioning of our ngm business has resulted in a delay in market penetration and delayed growth in end user adoption rates 
the ngm business will require continued investment and we will continue to experience net cash outflows until that market penetration and growth occurs 
the revisions to the financial forecast to reflect this new strategic direction resulted in a decline in the estimated fair value of the ngm business in as a result  we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if such assets fail the recoverability test  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
management must exercise judgment in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of the long lived assets 
factors that could indicate that impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to a plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
during the fourth quarter of  we made the determination that our strategic decision to reposition the ngm business and the resulting change in our projected results served as an indicator of impairment for long lived assets in our ngm reporting unit 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million impairment charge for impairment of long lived assets in our ngm reporting unit  the largest component of which consisted of technology and customer relationships 
in august  we announced the extension of the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of to include further headcount reductions and the closure of certain facilities 
due to our extension of our ngm restructuring plan and the resulting change in our projected results  we performed a recoverability test of our long lived assets in the ngm asset group and determined that the assets were recoverable from the undiscounted cash flows 
as of december   we had million and million  respectively  in long lived assets for our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with napm  we bill a rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
beginning july   the rrc fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to 
any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
investments we have approximately million par value in investments related to auction rate securities  or ars  all of which are classified as current as of december  in november  we accepted a settlement offer in the form of a rights offering  or ars rights  from the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of the ars  which provides us with the right to sell these securities at par value to the investment firm during a period beginning on june  as of december   the ars and ars rights are recorded at fair value of million in our financial statements 
changes in the fair value of the ars and the ars rights are recognized as gains or losses in our current period earnings until settlement under the rights offering 
for each of our ars and the associated ars rights  we determined the fair value using discounted cash flow methods 
the discounted cash flow valuation methods involved management s judgment and assumptions regarding discount rates  coupon rates  estimated maturity for each of the ars  and judgment regarding the selection of comparable securities 
we determined the fair value of the ars rights using a discounted cash flow method which involves judgment and assumptions regarding the timing of cash flows under the ars rights  fair value of the underlying ars and the ability of the investment firm to disburse the cash anticipated under the terms of the rights offering 
changes in our assumptions used to determine the fair value each period  particularly the ability of the investment firm to disburse the cash anticipated at the time we expect to exercise our ars rights in june  could have a material impact on results of our operations 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets  including valuation allowances  and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
our income tax provision includes us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes and was based on pre tax income or loss 
in determining the annual effective income tax rate  we analyzed various factors  including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess uncertain tax positions and recognize income tax benefits when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  we believe that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and were taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the internal revenue service  or irs  has completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years and the audit resulted in no material adjustments 
stock based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in accordance with the compensation stock compensation topic of the fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures at the time of grant  which estimate may be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense was million  which relates to unvested stock options  unvested restricted stock units  unvested restricted stock and unvested performance vested restricted stock units  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of specific financial targets at the end of the specified performance period and the employee s continued employment 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of stock based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
based upon our assessment in the fourth quarter of of the probability of achieving specific financial targets related to our performance vested restricted stock units granted during and  we revised our estimate of achievement from of target to of target 
in the third quarter of  we revised our estimate of achievement of the performance targets related to the performance vested restricted stock units granted during from of target to 
the change in this assumption resulted in a reduction of approximately million in compensation expense in the year ended our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million and diluted earnings per share was per share 
if we had continued to use the previous estimate of achievement of of the performance target related to the performance vested restricted stock units granted during  our as adjusted net income would have been approximately million and the as adjusted diluted earnings per share would have had been approximately per share 
we currently estimate achievement of of target and of target related to our performance vested restricted stock units granted during and  respectively 
further changes in our assumptions regarding the achievement of specific financial targets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

total revenue decreased million primarily due to a decrease of million in revenue as a result of a reduction in the effective price per transaction under our seven regional contracts in the united states with napm effective as of january the pricing model for the use of existing telephone number portability services under the napm contracts changed from a transaction based model in effect in to an annual fixed fee with price escalators 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in revenue from services provided outside of our napm contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states as a result of increased internet traffic and increased demand for our secure  reliable and scalable ultra services 
addressing 
addressing revenue increased million due to the expanded range of dns services  consisting of a million increase in revenue from our ultra services resulting from an increase in demand from customers who rely on us to meet their increasingly complex dns requirements and a million increase in revenue from an increased number of domain names under management

the decrease in our clearinghouse revenue of million was driven by a decrease in revenue of million as a result of a lower effective price per transaction under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in other revenue comprised of revenue from on going support services for telephone number portability solutions outside of the united states and one time functionality improvements requested by our customers 
the decrease in ngm revenue of million was due to a decrease in the intra carrier mobile messaging services our customers are utilizing 
expense cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million due to a million increase in cost of revenue of our clearinghouse business segment  partially offset by a million decrease in cost of revenue of our ngm business segment 
the increase in clearinghouse cost of revenue of million was primarily driven by an increase of million in personnel and personnel related expense and an increase of million due to outsourced services 
in addition  royalty expense related to us common short code services increased million 
the million decrease in ngm cost of revenue was due primarily to a decrease of million in personnel and personnel related expense primarily as a result of headcount reductions related to our ngm restructuring 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million 
our clearinghouse business segment sales and marketing expense increased million  partially offset by an million decrease attributable to our ngm business segment 
the increase in clearinghouse sales and marketing expense of million was primarily driven by an increase of million in personnel and personnel related expense and a million increase in professional fees  both primarily related to our focus on branding and our expanded service offerings

the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total some of our commercial commitments are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment date as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years in thousands standby letters of credit the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates affects the value of our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against such risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest in securities of highly rated issuers and follow investment policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  our exposure to this risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  our interest income on our short term investments for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately  we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services 
as of december   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we do not expect that an increase or decrease of in foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on our financial position 
because our sales and expense are primarily denominated in local currency  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales and expenses has not been material  and we do not employ measures intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk
