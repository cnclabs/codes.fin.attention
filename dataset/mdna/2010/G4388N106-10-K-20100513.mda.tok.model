item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on licensed trademarks  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we are materially dependent on our licensed trademarks as a substantial portion of our sales revenue comes from selling products under licensed trademarks 
as a result  we are materially dependent upon the continued use of such trademarks  particularly the vidal sassoon and revlon trademarks 
actions taken by licensors and other third parties could diminish greatly the value of any of our licensed trademarks 
if we were unable to sell products under these licensed trademarks or the value of the trademarks were diminished by the licensor due to any inability to perform under the terms of the agreements or other reasons  or due to the actions of third parties  the effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could be both negative and material 

table of contents we are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies and may be vulnerable in the event of a prolonged economic downturn 
our business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world  primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe and latin america 
these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry  which  in turn  are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters  terrorist attacks and political unrest 
consumer spending in any geographic region is generally affected by a number of factors  including local economic conditions  government actions  inflation  interest rates  energy costs  gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally  all of which are beyond our control 
consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods  when disposable income is lower  and may impact sales of our products 
as a result of the global recession  consumers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses  foreclosures  bankruptcies  reduced access to credit  and sharply falling asset prices  among other things 
a prolonged economic downturn or recession in the united states  united kingdom  canada  mexico or any of the other countries in which we conduct significant business may cause significant readjustments in both the volume and mix of our product sales  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these external factors and the extent to which they may continue is difficult to predict  and one or more of the factors could adversely impact our business 
in recent years  the retail industry in the us and  increasingly elsewhere  has been characterized by intense competition among retailers 
because such competition  particularly in weak retail economies  can cause retailers to struggle or fail  we must continuously monitor  and adapt to changes in  the profitability  creditworthiness and pricing policies of our customers 
a continued weakening of retail economies  as we have seen during fiscal and  could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to compete successfully  we must develop and introduce a continuing stream of innovative new products to meet changing consumer preferences 
our long term success in the competitive retail environment depends on our ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that meet changing consumer preferences and take advantage of opportunities sooner than our competition 
we face the risk that our competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with our products 
our core initiatives include fostering our culture of innovation and new product development  enhancing and extending our existing product categories and developing new allied product categories 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 
if we are unable to develop and introduce a continuing stream of new products  it may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further disruptions in us and international credit markets may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
disruptions in national and international credit markets have led to limitations on credit availability  tighter lending standards  higher interest rates on consumer and business loans  and higher fees associated with obtaining and maintaining credit availability 
additional and continued disruptions may materially limit consumer credit availability and restrict credit availability to our customer base and the company 
effective december   we amended our revolving credit agreement rca dated june  between helen of troy  lp  as borrower  and bank of america na and other lenders 
the amendment extended the maturity date until december  and modified certain terms and covenants 
for additional information regarding the amendment  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the amendment to the rca increased our borrowing costs and adjusted the limitations on our ability to incur additional debt 
in addition  in the event of new disruptions in the financial markets and an increased level of recent banking failures  current or future lenders may become unwilling or unable to continue to advance funds under any agreements in place  increase their commitments under existing credit arrangements or enter into new financing arrangements 
the failure of our lenders to provide 
table of contents sufficient financing may constrain our ability to operate or grow the business and to make complementary strategic business and or brand acquisitions 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
changes in the relation of other foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our sales and profitability and can result in exchange losses because the company has operations and assets located outside the united states 
the company transacts a significant portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar foreign currencies 
such transactions include sales  certain inventory purchases and operating expenses 
as a result  portions of our cash  trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  foreign operations will continue to expose us to foreign currency fluctuations  both for purposes of actual conversion and financial reporting purposes 
additionally  we purchase a substantial amount of our products from chinese manufacturers 
while the chinese renminbi remained relatively stable against the us dollar during fiscal  it appreciated significantly against the us dollar in fiscal and and some news reports suggest future appreciation is likely during fiscal although our purchases are in us dollars  if the chinese renminbi were to resume its rise against the us dollar  the costs of our products would likely rise over time because of the impact the fluctuations will have on our suppliers  and we may not be able to pass any or all of these price increases on to our customers 
where operating conditions permit  we seek to reduce foreign currency risk by purchasing most of our inventory with us dollars and by converting cash balances denominated in foreign currencies to us dollars 
we have historically hedged against certain foreign currency exchange rate risk by using a series of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in these transactions  we execute a forward currency contract that will settle at the end of a forecasted period 
because the size and terms of the forward contract are designed so that its fair market value will move in the opposite direction and approximate magnitude of the underlying foreign currency s forecasted exchange gain or loss during the forecasted period  a hedging relationship is created 
to the extent we forecast the expected foreign currency cash flows from the period the forward contract is entered into until the date it will settle with reasonable accuracy  we significantly lower or materially eliminate a particular currency s exchange risk exposure over the life of the related forward contract 
we enter into these types of agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and the hedge pricing appears reasonable 
it is not practical for us to hedge all our exposures  nor are we able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect and interplay of all foreign currency fluctuations on translated amounts or future net income 
this is due to our constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that each foreign currency reacts differently to the us dollar and the significant number of currencies involved 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us dollar foreign exchange rates will be stable in the future or that fluctuations in foreign currency markets will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents acquisitions may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated or we may not be able to identify suitable new acquisition opportunities  which may constrain our prospects for future growth and profitability and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we are constantly looking for opportunities to make complementary strategic business and or brand acquisitions 
these acquisitions  if not favorably received by consumers  shareholders  analysts  and others in the investment community  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in addition  any acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel associated with the acquisitions  difficulties in integrating distribution channels  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in transitioning and preserving customer  contractor  supplier and other important third party relationships  difficulties realizing anticipated cost savings  synergies and other benefits related to an acquisition  risks associated with subsequent operating asset write offs  contingent liabilities  and impairment of related acquired intangible assets  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited experience  and potential loss of key employees associated with the acquisitions 
any difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may incur debt to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  which could have an adverse impact on our business and profitability 
our debt could adversely affect our financial condition and can add constraints on our ability to operate our business 
our indebtedness can  among other things increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain necessary financing and to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures  and for other general corporate purposes  subject us to a higher interest expense a significant portion of our debt is fixed or effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swaps and these rates may produce higher interest expense than would be available with floating rate debt  as is currently the case with decreased market interest rates  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  
table of contents limit our ability to pursue acquisitions or sell assets  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our debt agreements contain restrictive financial and operational covenants 
significant restrictive covenants include limitations on  among other things  our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional debt  including guarantees  grant certain types of liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  pay dividends on our common stock  repurchase our common stock  enter into substantial new lines of business  and enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates 
our failure to comply with these and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we rely on our central global enterprise resource planning systems and other peripheral information systems 
obsolescence or interruptions in the operation of our computerized systems or other information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we conduct most of our businesses under one integrated global enterprise resource planning system erp  which we originally implemented in september most of our operations are dependent on this system 
we continuously make adjustments to improve the effectiveness of the erp and other peripheral information systems 
any failures or disruptions in the erp and other information systems or any complications resulting from adjustments could cause interruption or loss of data in our information or logistical systems that could materially impact our ability to procure products from our factories and suppliers  transport them to our distribution centers  and store and deliver them to our customers on time and in the correct amounts 
in addition  natural disasters or other extraordinary events may disrupt our information systems and other infrastructure  and our data recovery processes may not be sufficient to protect against loss 
furthermore  application program bugs  system conflict crashes  user error  data integrity issues  customer data conflicts and integration issues all pose significant risks 
we rely on certain outside vendors to assist us with implementation of  and enhancements to  our information systems and other vendors to assist us in maintaining some of our infrastructure 
should any of these vendors fail to perform as expected  it could adversely affect our service levels and threaten our ability to conduct business 
in addition  at the end of fiscal  we have not completed the migration of our core software to newer versions because of the degree of customization it underwent upon its initial installation 
this places our software vendor s ability to continue to provide the appropriate level of support for these systems at risk 
these factors described above could cause significant disruptions to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents audits and related disputes with taxing authorities could have an adverse impact on our business 
from time to time  we are involved in tax audits and related disputes with various taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that we have complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations and in the past have disagreed with taxing authority positions on various issues 
historically  we have vigorously defended our tax positions through available administrative and judicial avenues 
based on currently available information  we have established reserves for our best estimate of the probable tax liabilities 
future actions by taxing authorities may result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established  which could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
for more information about tax audits and related disputes  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
potential changes in laws  including tax laws  and the costs and complexities of compliance with such laws could have an adverse impact on our business 
the impact of future legislation in the us or abroad  including such things as climate change related legislation  tax legislation  regulations or treaties  including any that would affect the companies or subsidiaries that comprise our consolidated group is always uncertain 
the us congress continues to consider certain proposed changes in the tax laws  and new energy and environmental legislation that  if enacted  may increase our costs of doing business 
our ability to respond to such changes  the cost and complexity of compliance with new law changes  and their impact on our ability to operate economically and effectively in jurisdictions always presents a risk 
under current tax law  favorable tax treatment of our non us net income is dependent on our ability to avoid classification as a controlled foreign corporation 
changes in the composition of our stock ownership could have an impact on our classification 
if our classification were to change  it could have a material adverse effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn  on the company s business 
a non us corporation  such as ours  will constitute a controlled foreign corporation or cfc for us federal income tax purposes if its largest us shareholders us  those owning percent or more of its shares together own more than percent of the stock outstanding 
if the irs or a court determined that we were a cfc  then each of our us shareholders who own directly  indirectly  or constructively percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the last day of our taxable year would be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our subpart f income and the subpart f income of any our subsidiaries determined to be a cfc for the period during which we and our non us subsidiaries were a cfc 
in addition  any gain on the sale of our shares realized by such a shareholder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s proportionate share of our and our cfc subsidiaries undistributed earnings and profits accumulated during the shareholder s holding period of the shares while we are a cfc
