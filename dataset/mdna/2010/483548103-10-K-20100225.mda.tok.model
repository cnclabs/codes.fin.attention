overview of business kaman corporation is composed of two business segments industrial distribution  the third largest power transmission motion control industrial distributor in north america 
aerospace  a manufacturer and subcontractor in the international  commercial and military aerospace and defense markets 
the following is a summary of key events our net sales from continuing operations decreased in compared to our earnings from continuing operations decreased in compared to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to in  a decrease of compared to on february   we completed the transfer of title to the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopters  including related inventory and equipment  from the commonwealth of australia to the company 
we entered into a contract modification with the united states government usg for the award of options  and under the multi option joint programmable fuze jpf contract 
the total value of the option award is approximately million and deliveries are expected to begin in the second quarter of upon exercise  the value of options and will depend on the quantity selected by the usg  add ons  foreign military orders and future funding 
we replaced our five year million revolving credit facility with a new three year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the new facility includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase the aggregate amount available to million with additional commitments from lenders 
we were awarded a five year contract with a potential value of million to build composite helicopter blade skins and skin core assemblies for bell helicopters 
we were awarded a million contract from the us marine corps on behalf of team k max  which includes lockheed martin  to demonstrate the ability of the unmanned k max helicopter to deliver cargo to troops in extreme environments and at high altitudes 
in the last week of january  the unmanned k max helicopter successfully completed the demonstration 
results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales in thousands industrial distribution aerospace total change change the decrease in net sales for as compared to was attributable to a decline in organic sales at our industrial distribution segment 
this decrease was partially offset by sales growth in our aerospace segment and the full year effect of sales from the acquisition of industrial supply corp isc in march  the acquisition of uk composites in june  and the acquisition of industrial rubber mechanics incorporated inrumec in october foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of million on sales for the increase in net sales for compared to was attributable to organic growth at both our segments  as well as the addition of sales related to the acquired businesses 
the aerospace segment s net sales increased due to the acquisition of uk composites  as well as organic sales growth resulting mainly from increased shipments for the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit program and the jpf fuze program 
the industrial distribution segment s net sales increased for compared to due to several new large national accounts  as well as the acquisitions of isc and inrumec 
gross profit in thousands gross profit change change of net sales gross profit decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in gross profit at our industrial distribution segment  partially offset by an increase at our aerospace segment and the full year effect on gross profit from the acquisitions of isc  uk composites and inrumec 
the decrease in gross profit at industrial distribution was a result of lower sales volume  while the increase at aerospace was driven by increased shipments on the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit and jpf fuze programs and increased sales of bearing products for the military markets 
these increases were slightly offset by the absence of gross profit previously generated from the now terminated australian helicopter support program and decreased sales volume related to our bearing product lines for the commercial and regional business jet markets 
gross profit in increased primarily due to the increased sales volume at the industrial distribution segment  higher shipments to the commercial aerospace industry and the absence of australia sh g a program charges  which amounted to million in these positive results were partially offset by a less favorable product mix for the jpf fuze program and the charges  excluding goodwill  recorded by the aerospace segment due to issues encountered by aerospace wichita  as discussed more fully below 
gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin decreased due to the aforementioned product mix changes for the jpf fuze program and the impact of the charges recorded by the aerospace segment due to issues encountered by aerospace wichita 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a in thousands s  g a change change of net sales the decrease in s  g a for as compared to is primarily due to tighter cost control leading to expense reductions at both our segments and our corporate office and reduction in expense for our supplemental employees retirement plan serp 
the expense reductions included furloughs and a reduction in other employee benefit expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisitions of isc  uk composites and inrumec during and an increase of million in pension expense 
furloughs were taken by our corporate officers and employees at our industrial distribution segment and select operations of our aerospace segment 
the increase in s  g a for compared to is primarily due to the three acquisitions made during  increases related to higher personnel costs as well as increased bid and proposal activity at our aerospace segment 
these increases were partially offset by lower expenses related to fringe benefits  incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights 
goodwill impairment in thousands goodwill impairment during the second quarter of  the aerospace wichita facility lost two of its major contracts and experienced continuing production and quality issues 
as a result  we performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment and recorded a non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million 
this represented the entire goodwill balance for the reporting unit 
we performed our annual test of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of and no impairment charge was required for the year ended december  operating income in thousands operating income change change of net sales the decrease in operating income in compared to was primarily driven by a decrease in operating income at our industrial distribution segment and an increase in pension expense offset in part by the absence of the million non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge taken in  a slight increase in aerospace segment organic operating income and the addition of operating income associated with the acquisition of uk composites 
the increase in operating income in compared to was due to an increase in operating income at our industrial distribution segment and a decrease in corporate expenses  offset by a lower operating income at our aerospace segment 
the increase in operating income at our industrial distribution segment was primarily a result of the new national accounts 
the lower operating income at our aerospace segment was primarily driven by the charges associated with aerospace wichita and lower foreign military sales under the jpf fuze program 
these reductions were offset by the absence of million in charges related to the australia sh g a program recorded in please refer to the individual segment discussions for details on their operating income 
interest expense  net in thousands interest expense  net net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and other borrowings offset by interest income 
the increase in net interest expense for compared to was primarily due to higher total average bank borrowings and lower interest income  partially offset by lower interest rates in the higher average bank borrowings for was the result of progressively higher borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement as we funded the three acquisitions completed in the decrease in net interest expense for compared to was primarily due to the repayment of a significant portion of our revolving credit line as of december   using the proceeds from the sale of the music segment  as well as the redemption of all outstanding convertible debentures in late in the second quarter of  we borrowed against our revolving credit line again to fund working capital requirements and the uk composites acquisition 
effective income tax rate effective income tax rate the effective tax rate represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared to is primarily due to a one time tax benefit for foreign exchange losses incurred as part of an international recapitalization  and from a discrete benefit due to certain foreign tax incentives  as well as the million non tax deductible non cash goodwill impairment charge taken during the second quarter of we anticipate the full year effective tax rate for to be approximately 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to is due to the non tax deductible non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the second quarter of by the aerospace segment 
other matters moosup the ctdep has given us approval for reclassification of groundwater in the vicinity of the moosup  ct facility consistent with the character of the area 
this facility is currently being held for disposal 
we have completed the process of connecting neighboring properties to public drinking water in accordance with such approval and in coordination with the ctdep and local authorities 
site characterization of the environmental condition of the property  which began in  is continuing 
the total anticipated cost of the environmental remediation activities associated with the moosup property is million  all of which has been accrued 
the total amount paid to date in connection with these environmental remediation activities is million 
a portion million of the accrual related to this property is included in other accruals and payables and the balance is included in other long term liabilities 
the remaining balance of the accrual reflects the total anticipated cost of completing these environmental remediation activities 
although it is reasonably possible that additional costs will be paid in connection with the resolution of this matter  we are unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs  if any  at this time 
new hartford in connection with the sale of the music segment in  we assumed responsibility for meeting certain requirements of the transfer act that applied to our transfer of ovation 
under the transfer act  those responsibilities essentially consist of assessing the site s environmental conditions and remediating environmental impairments  if any  caused by ovation s operations prior to the sale 
the site is a multi tenant industrial park  in which ovation and other unrelated entities lease space 
the environmental assessment process  which began in  is still in process 
we estimate our portion of the cost to assess the environmental conditions and remediate this site is million  unchanged from previously reported estimates  all of which has been accrued 
the total amount paid to date in connection with these environmental remediation activities is million 
a portion million of the accrual related to this property is included in other accruals and payables and the balance is included in other long term liabilities 
the remaining balance of the accrual reflects the total anticipated cost of completing these environmental remediation activities 
although it is reasonably possible that additional costs will be paid in connection with the resolution of this matter  we are unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs  if any  at this time 
bloomfield in connection with the purchase of the portion of the bloomfield campus that kaman aerospace corporation had leased from navair  we have assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the facility as may be required under the transfer act and we continue the effort to define the scope of the remediation that will be required by the ctdep 
the assumed environmental liability of million was determined by taking the undiscounted remediation liability of million and discounting it at a rate of 
the total amount paid to date in connection with these environmental remediation activities is million 
a portion million of the accrual related to this property is included in other accruals and payables and the balance is included in other long term liabilities 
this remediation process will take many years to complete 
although it is reasonably possible that additional costs will be paid in connection with the resolution of this matter  we are unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs  if any  at this time 
united kingdom in connection with the purchase of uk composites  we accrued  at the time of acquisition  million for environmental compliance at their facilities 
the total amount paid to date in connection with these environmental remediation activities is million 
the us dollar equivalent of the remaining environmental compliance liability as of december  is million  which is included in other accruals and payables 
we continue to assess the work that may be required  which may result in a change to this accrual 
although it is reasonably possible that additional costs will be paid in connection with the resolution of this matter  we are unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs  if any  at this time 
in december  a workplace accident occurred at our uk composites facility in darwen in which one employee died and another was seriously injured 
in accordance with uk law  the matter has been the subject of an investigation carried out jointly by lancashire police and the health and safety executive hse to determine whether criminal charges are appropriate in this case 
although we have not received official notification that the police investigation has ended with no recommendation of criminal charges  we believe that this is the case because the matter has been transferred to the regional coroner to conduct an inquest  which is customary in cases where the local police have not sought prosecution 
the inquest is scheduled for april following the inquest  we expect that the hse will conduct proceedings under uk health and safety legislation 
we currently estimate that the total potential financial exposure of the uk composites operation with respect to these government proceedings is not likely to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
segment results of operations and financial condition industrial distribution segment outlook because of our diverse customer base  our performance tends to track the us industrial production index 
this index is impacted by the broader economic environment  which will  from time to time  experience periods of downturn 
although these periods of downturn have historically not lasted for an extended duration  they do have an impact on the near term performance of our business 
we are therefore affected  to a large extent  by the overall business climate for our customer industries and their plant capacity utilization levels  and the effect of pricing spikes and or supply interruptions for basic commodities such as steel and oil 
during  we continued to experience weakness in certain markets and industries that we first encountered late in while certain markets and products  such as food and beverage processing and power generation  have been less impacted  other industries have experienced significant declines  including non metallic mineral products  metal mining  machinery and fabricated metals 
this downturn has had a significant impact on our results and we took actions to mitigate these negative trends through measured and appropriate cost reduction activities  continued focus on pursuit of additional national account business and initiatives aimed at improving both our gross profit rates and operating margins 
we continue to focus on the underlying fundamentals of our business with an emphasis on cost reduction  margin improvements  and adding market share 
for we expect sales growth to be and further improvements in gross margin rates 
we anticipate operation margin to be up basis points 
our strategy the primary strategies for the industrial distribution segment are to expand our geographic footprint in major industrial markets to enhance our position in the competition for regional and national accounts 
in order to increase our geographic footprint  we continue to explore potential acquisition candidates that are consistent with our strategic objectives 
by so doing  we will more clearly establish our business as one that can provide comprehensive services to our customers who are continually looking to streamline their procurement operations and consolidate supplier relationships 
gain additional business from existing customers and new opportunities from a wider slice of the market 
in recent years  we have worked to increase market share in several less cyclical markets including the food and beverage  coal mining and energy industries 
we are also expanding our presence in the power generation and utilities markets  two other less cyclical industries 
we have been successful in this endeavor  as evidenced by our national account wins  and continue to target these industries 
we also continued to build our government business group to service our year contract with the general services administration center for facilities maintenance and hardware gsa which allows us to supply government agencies with maintenance  repair and operations mro organizations products from our major product categories 
the first of these contracts was awarded to us during results of operations in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales net sales the decrease in net sales for as compared to is due to a decline of in organic sales when measured on a same day sales basis 
this decrease in organic sales was due to a significant decrease in sales to oems and reduced capital spending by mro customers and changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had an unfavorable impact of million on sales 
the decrease was partially offset by the addition of sales resulting from the acquisitions of isc and inrumec 
by industry there were significant declines in sales in the non metallic mineral products  metal mining  machinery and fabricated metals industries which were partially offset by slight sales increases in the food and beverage and paper industries 
the increase in net sales during as compared to was due to a balance of organic growth and the contribution of million in sales from the two acquisitions during the year 
the remaining increase was due to higher sales to new national accounts  some of which were ramping up during this sales growth was partially offset by the slowing industrial market and an uncertain economy  particularly in the latter half of the fourth quarter of during  we continued to make investments in infrastructure and opened three new branches and one new distribution center in the united states 
as previously disclosed  these investments in infrastructure and personnel have had an impact on our operating income and it will take several years for the benefits of these investments to be fully realized 
operating income operating income decreased for as compared to primarily due to the decrease in organic sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs 
additionally  operating income was impacted by increases in pension plan expense  employee separation costs and insurance costs 
these factors were partially offset by improved gross margin rates and steps taken by management to reduce operating costs 
these steps included a business wide furlough and the consolidation of branches and the closure of underperforming branches  which resulted in a reduction in headcount 
additionally  we closed the us pension plan to new employees of the industrial distribution segment  effective june  the savings that resulted from the business wide furlough are nonrecurring and although the other actions have led to increased costs in the near term  management believes that the long term reduction in operating costs will assist the industrial distribution segment to manage through this economic downturn and emerge as an even more profitable business 
operating income increased for compared to primarily due to the increase in organic sales volume primarily in the first nine months of the year 
results for the fourth quarter of were significantly impacted by the rapid decline in sales to oems and deterioration in capital spending by mro organizations 
aerospace segment outlook although the military aerospace market remained relatively stable during  as a result of the downturn in the global economy the commercial markets  including regional business jets  did not perform at their levels 
the impact of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market upon the segment has been mitigated by our existing military work which represents approximately of total aerospace sales 
the segment performed well with operating profit return on net sales greater than despite the operating performance achievements we have seen in  we anticipate sales to be relatively flat and operating margin to be up basis points 
we continue to focus on gross profit improvements on our current programs with the potential for increased sales and profitability through sales of the sh g i inventory and related equipment 
we anticipate that our bearing product lines will continue to see weakness in the commercial markets with the military markets relatively consistent with our strategy our strategy for the aerospace segment is to expand our global market position in military and commercial markets  while maintaining leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support and continuing to concentrate on lean manufacturing techniques and lead time reduction 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for our aerospace segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract net sales net sales increased for as compared to due to increased sales on our military programs and the incremental contribution of million in sales from the acquisition of uk composites 
the increase in sales on our military programs was due to increased shipments to the united states government usg and foreign militaries fms on the jpf program  increased shipments on the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit program  additional upgrade work on the egypt sh g e helicopter fleet  sh g spare part sales to new zealand and increased sales of our bearing products for military platforms 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of sales related to the australian helicopter program support center  a decline in sales of our bearings products for business jet platforms  and an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rate 
the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates was million  primarily as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling which unfavorably impacted the current year sales of uk composites 
aerospace sales were lower than we had anticipated for  due primarily to the absence of jpf fuze sales to the usg and fms which were anticipated in the fourth quarter of the required number of fuzes were produced for shipment to the usg and fms  however  delivery was delayed due to an issue with a component supplied by a third party that had not been produced to usg specifications 
management has addressed this supplier issue and expects to ship fuzes during the growth in net sales for compared to was attributable to million of sales by uk composites  which was acquired in mid june  higher sales to the commercial aerospace market and increased production and shipments under the segment s military related programs 
the increase in the military related programs was due to increased production and shipments of the jpf fuze to the usg  higher shipments on several legacy fuze programs and higher production levels for the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter program 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales due to the production and operational issues experienced by aerospace wichita  the termination of the production and service contract related to the australian sh g a super seasprite program  as well as work performed for the egyptian sh g e in that was not repeated during operating income operating income increased for when compared to due to the absence of the million non cash  non tax deductible  goodwill impairment charge taken in  increased shipments of higher margin jpf fuzes  the addition of operating income from the acquisition of uk composites  increased sales on the egypt helicopter upgrade program  increased sales of spares to new zealand to support their helicopter fleet  higher production levels of the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit program and increased sales of bearing products for military platforms 
these increases were partially offset by reduced gross profit generated by our bearing products for commercial platforms resulting from the lower sales volume as noted above 
the aerospace segment has taken measures designed to reduce costs and improve operating performance  such as furloughs at certain operations 
these measures helped improve operating income for the segment  however  the effect of the furloughs in is nonrecurring in nature 
the decrease in operating income in as compared to is due to million in charges related to goodwill impairment and the write off of aerospace wichita inventory and tooling costs and lower foreign military sales under the jpf fuze program 
these decreases were partially offset by the absence of the million contract loss accrual recorded in related to the australian sh g a super seasprite program 
backlog the decrease in backlog in compared to is the result of the changes in the buying patterns of our customers during and the impact of certain new programs  a and bell helicopters  which are not fully included in backlog at december  due to the timing of order receipt 
the increase in backlog in compared to is due to new orders under the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter program and the addition of the uk composites backlog resulting from its acquisition in june  partially offset by a decrease in backlog resulting from the termination of the sh g a super seasprite program with the commonwealth of australia 
major programs product lines military markets a in  the segment signed a five year requirements contract with boeing for the production of wing control surfaces inboard and outboard flaps  slats and deceleron assemblies for the us air force s a fleet  with initial deliveries scheduled to begin in full rate production is expected to begin in with an average of approximately ship sets per year through this multiyear contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from the us air force usaf 
blackhawk the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter cockpit program involves the manufacture of cockpits including the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for most models of the blackhawk helicopter 
total orders placed to date for this program are cockpits 
the total potential value of this program is at least million  with deliveries on current orders continuing through through december   a total of cockpits have been delivered under this contract 
we currently expect production levels to be slightly lower than those experienced in due to a reduction in orders received from sikorsky 
the segment also performs additional subcontract work involving fuselage joining and installation tasks  blade erosion coating and the production of certain mechanical subassemblies for this helicopter program 
bearings our bearing products are included on military platforms manufactured in north america and europe 
these products are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by the manufacturers 
the most significant portion of our sales is derived from the us military platforms  such as the ah  c and f a aircraft  with additional sales in europe on the typhoon 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear and driveline couplings for helicopters 
c the segment continues production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c although recent press reports note that continued production of the c may be at risk  we received orders in for an additional ship sets which will extend our work on the program through egypt sh g e the segment continues work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine kaman sh g e helicopters originally delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
through december   we are on contract for million of work related to maintenance and upgrades 
this program has a current contract value of approximately million 
fmu joint programmable fuze jpf we manufacture the jpf fuze  an electro mechanical bomb safing and arming device  which allows the settings of a weapon to be programmed in flight 
during we entered into a contract modification with the usg for the award of options  and under the company s multi option jpf contract 
the modification provides increased unit prices and quantities for the next three option buys upon exercise and updates the original contract negotiated in the total value of the option award is approximately million and deliveries are expected to begin in the second quarter of upon exercise  the value of options and will depend on the quantity selected by the usaf  add ons  foreign military orders and future funding 
the total value of jpf contracts awarded by the usg from inception of the program through december  is million 
this value primarily consists of options through under the original contract and various contract modifications  including a two phase facilitization contract modification and additional foreign military sales facilitated by the usg  as well as a variety of development and engineering contracts  along with special tooling and test equipment 
we expect to continue production under the currently awarded options through the facilitization program at our middletown  ct facility has contributed to increased production capabilities and allowed us to improve our quality and efficiency on the jpf program 
the facilitization program provided us an opportunity to review production workflow to create greater efficiencies  qualify a second kaman site for full production and create an enhanced fuze design 
during  we passed the final testing and began production of the enhanced fuze 
mh the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program includes the manufacture and assembly of composite tail rotor pylons 
this program has undergone numerous customer directed design changes causing costs on this program to exceed the price for the contract 
management believes that the incremental costs related to customer directed design changes are recoverable 
at december   contract price negotiations for this program have not yet been finalized 
to date  we have recorded million in contract losses  with million and million recorded in and  respectively  for higher scrap  inefficiencies and tooling costs related to this program 
u 
s army in december  we signed a million dollar contract with the us army to perform blade erosion coating on up to helicopter blades  with initial deliveries scheduled to begin in the first quarter of commercial markets in late  we signed a seven year follow on contract with boeing for the production of fixed wing trailing edge assemblies for the boeing and aircraft 
during  on average we delivered ship sets per month on the boeing platform and ship set per month on the boeing for  we currently anticipate a reduction in the number of ship sets delivered per month to occur during the year 
this multiyear contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from its customers 
airbus our uk composites operations provide composite components for many airbus platforms 
the most significant of these are the a  a and a orders for these components are dependent on the build rate for these various platforms 
bearings our bearing products are included on commercial airliners and regional business jets manufactured in north and south america  europe and asia and are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear  and driveline couplings for helicopters 
the most significant portion of our commercial sales is derived from boeing and airbus platforms  such as the boeing   and and the airbus a  a and a bell helicopters in september  we were awarded a five year contract with a potential value of million to build composite helicopter blade skins and skin core assemblies for bell helicopters 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide different assemblies for h       and ba aircraft 
all work will be performed at our full service aerospace innovation and manufacturing support center in bloomfield  connecticut 
first article deliveries to bell s hurst  texas facility began in late annual quantities for this program will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders bell receives from its customers 
other matters sh g i as previously reported  we reached an agreement with the commonwealth of australia in providing for the termination of the sh g a super seasprite program 
pursuant to the agreement  the commonwealth transferred ownership of the sh g a super seasprite helicopters to the company  together with spare parts and associated equipment  in exchange for a release of any remaining payment obligation for net unbilled receivables totaling approximately million 
the transfer of ownership was completed on february  and we are actively engaged in efforts to resell the aircraft  spare parts and equipment to other potential customers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the commonwealth of australia  we have agreed to share all proceeds from the resale of the aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis  and total payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales  of which at least million aud must be paid by march to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud  additional payments of million aud each must be paid in march of and in late  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts that limit the foreign currency risks associated with these required payments to million 
see note  derivative financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these instruments 
in addition  to secure these payments the company has provided the commonwealth with a million aud unconditional letter of credit  which is being reduced as such payments are made 
at december   we had made required payments of million aud 
as of that date  the us dollar value of the remaining million aud required payment was million 
sales generated by the sh g a service center  which had been a meaningful portion of our aerospace segment s net sales in recent years  ended at the conclusion of the support center ramp down period  which occurred during the fourth quarter of since the successful transfer of the helicopters and related equipment  segment management has attended trade events to market the aircraft  obtained marketing licenses required by the usg  begun discussions with foreign governments regarding the sale of the helicopters and received small orders for the spare parts and related equipment 
warranty and contract related matters there continue to be two warranty related matters that impact the fmu program at the aerospace segment s orlando facility orlando facility 
the items involved are an impact switch embedded in certain bomb fuzes that was recalled by a supplier and an incorrect part  called a bellows motor  found to be contained in bomb fuzes manufactured for the us army utilizing systems which originated before we acquired the orlando facility 
the us army sustainment command usasc  the procurement agency that administers the fmu contract  had authorized warranty rework for the bellows motor matter in late early  however  we were not permitted to finish the rework due to issues raised by the usasc primarily related to administrative matters and requests for verification of the accuracy of test equipment which accuracy was subsequently verified 
in late  the usasc informed us that it was changing its remedy under the contract from performance of warranty rework to an equitable adjustment to the contract price 
we responded  explaining our view that we had complied with contract requirements 
in june  the usasc affirmed its position and gave instructions for disposition of the subject fuzes  including both the impact switch and bellows motor related items  to a navy facility and we complied with that direction 
in november  the united states government usg instituted suit  alleging liability associated with this matter and including specific claims of about million treble damages in connection with allegedly false claims by us for payment for fuzes containing the incorrect part and million in connection with rework 
by letter dated july   usasc informed us that it also demands payment of million under the contract related to warranty rework 
we believe that all these allegations are unfounded and we are defending ourselves vigorously 
at december   we had no amount accrued for this demand 
as reported previously  a separate contract dispute between the orlando facility and the usasc relative to the fmu fuze program is now in litigation 
the usasc has basically alleged the existence of latent defects in certain fuzes due to unauthorized rework during production and has sought to revoke their acceptance 
we believe that the orlando facility performed in accordance with the contract and it is the government that materially breached the contract terms in several ways 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we cancelled the contract and  in january  commenced litigation before the board requesting a declaratory judgment that the cancellation was proper 
shortly thereafter  the usasc notified us that it was terminating the contract for default  making the allegations noted above  and we filed a second complaint with the board appealing that termination decision 
the litigation process continues 
in the same letter of july   referenced above  usasc also demanded a repayment of million for these alleged latent defects 
we contest this demand and have filed an appeal of it before the board 
at december   we had no amount accrued for these matters as we believe that the likelihood of an adverse outcome to this litigation is remote 
liquidity and capital resources discussion and analysis of cash flows we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund working capital and investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from or used by operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in our business segments and their programs  acquisitions  divestitures  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and factors that might otherwise affect the company s business and operations generally  as described under the heading risk factors and forward looking statements in item a of part i of this form k 
we continue to rely upon bank financing as an important source of support for our business activities including acquisitions 
we believe this  when combined with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to support our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately million in  primarily related to information technology investments 
we anticipate a variety of items will have an impact on our liquidity during the next months  aside from our normal working capital requirements 
these may include the resolution of any of the matters described in md a  including the fmu litigation  the cost sharing arrangement with the commonwealth of australia  the cost of existing environmental remediation matters  the uk composites workplace accident and required pension contributions 
however  we do not believe any of these matters will lead to a shortage of capital resources or liquidity that would prevent us from continuing with our business operations as expected 
during  we successfully executed a million revolving credit agreement and  in late  a million term loan credit agreement  however  the current market may adversely affect the securing and or pricing of additional financing  if any  that might be necessary to continue with our growth strategy and finance working capital requirements 
we are watchful of the developments in the credit markets and continuously assess the impact that current economic conditions may have on our operations 
additionally  with the significant downturn in the financial markets in  the market value of our pension plan assets has significantly decreased  resulting in higher pension plan contributions and a significant increase in pension expense in management continuously monitors the assumptions used in the determination of our benefit obligation and compares them to actual performance 
during  our pension assets have recovered some of their lost value and we believe the assumptions selected are valid due to the long term nature of our benefit obligations 
on february   our board of directors authorized management to amend the pension plan 
the amendment will  among other things  close the pension plan to all new hires on or after march  and change the benefit calculation for existing employees related to pay and years of service 
specifically  changes in pay will be taken into account for benefit calculation purposes until the end of calendar year  the benefit formula will be improved to use the highest five years out of the last ten years of service up to december   whether consecutive or not  and years of service will continue to be added for purposes of the benefit calculations through december   with no further accumulation for service thereafter except for vesting purposes 
we estimate the changes to the pension plan will result in a net curtailment loss of approximately million 
in addition  we estimate that the projected benefit obligation will be reduced  and the pension plan s funded status would change by approximately million on march  based on the above action  we anticipate our pension expense to decrease by approximately million in as compared to on february   our board of directors also authorized certain enhancements to the defined contribution plan including  among other things  an increase in employer matching contributions made to the plan based on each participant s pre tax contributions 
the enhancements will become effective january  a summary of our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations is as follows vs 
vs 
in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activites financing activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to the following lower working capital requirements due to lower sales at our industrial distribution segment 
improvements in our inventory procurement and management processes

decreased payments of taxes  due to the absence of payments made in related to the sale of our music segment in the fourth quarter of decreased cash outflows associated with incentive compensation in compared to lower serp payments for retiring executives 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to cash used for acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million for compared to in we had a net repayment under the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement of million  compared to net proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and term loan of million received in the proceeds received in were used to fund our acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to this increase in cash used is primarily attributable to increased cash requirements to fund working capital needs in as compared to as specifically discussed below inventory levels increased in the aerospace segment  primarily due to the acquisition of a k max aircraft  higher amounts of inventory at aerospace wichita and higher jpf inventory 
higher payments of prior year accrued fringe benefits and incentive compensation during total cash payments for income taxes increased significantly  primarily due to the taxes paid on the gain resulting from the music segment sale 
the company paid out a significant amount of serp payments in compared to primarily attributable to the retirement of our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of uk composites and isc during the second quarter of and the acquisition of inrumec during the fourth quarter of  the absence of cash inflows from the sale of our former music segment in  and the increase in capital expenditures in both our segments 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared to we had net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of million for as compared to repayments of million for the significant change was driven by the issuance of long term debt in and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  offset partially by the payment of dividends 
financing arrangements on september   we entered into a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility with co lead arrangers bank of america  the bank of nova scotia  and rbs citizens and a syndicate of lenders revolving credit agreement  which replaced our then existing million senior revolving credit facility which was due to expire on august  the former revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase the aggregate amount available to million  subject to additional commitments from lenders 
the revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the lenders have been granted a security interest in substantially all of our domestic personal property and other assets excluding real estate and a pledge of of our equity interest in certain of our foreign subsidiaries and of our equity interest in our domestic subsidiaries  as collateral for our obligations under the revolving credit agreement 
interest rates on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are variable and are determined based on a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness as of the last day of the most recently ended measurement period to consolidated ebitda the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
at december   the interest rate for the outstanding amounts on the revolving credit agreement was 
in addition  we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment amount at a rate ranging from to per annum  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
fees for outstanding letters of credit range from to  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
we anticipate the interest expense to increase by approximately million compared to on october   we executed a term loan credit agreement with co lead arrangers bank of america and the bank of nova scotia and a syndicate of lenders term loan agreement 
the term loan agreement  which is in addition to our current revolving credit agreement  is a million facility with a four year term  requiring quarterly payments of principal at the rate of with of the initial aggregate principal payable in the final quarter 
we may increase the term loan  by up to an aggregate of million with additional commitments from the lenders or new commitments from acceptable financial institutions 
in conjunction with the entry into the revolving credit agreement on september   the term loan agreement was amended to allow for security interests and financial covenants consistent with those defined in the revolving credit agreement 
facility fees and interest rates under the term loan agreement are variable and are determined on the basis of our credit rating from standard poor s 
in april  standard poor s re affirmed our rating as investment grade bbb with an outlook of stable 
we believe this is a favorable rating for a company of our size 
under the terms of the current term loan agreement  if this rating should decrease  the effect would be to increase facility fees as well as the interest rates charged 
at december   the interest rate for the outstanding amounts on the term loan agreement was 
the financial covenants associated with the revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement include a requirement that i the ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  ii the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  and iii the ratio of ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  to the sum of i net interest expense  ii the aggregate principal amount of all regularly scheduled principal payments of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money  iii all dividends or other distributions with respect to any equity interests of the company and iv the aggregate amount of federal  state  local  and foreign income taxes paid in cash cannot be less than to for any measurement period between september  march   to for any measurement period between april  to september  or to for any measurement period on or after october  we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  and we do not anticipate noncompliance in the foreseeable future 
total average bank borrowings  including the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement  for were million 
as of december   there was million available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement  net of letters of credit 
letters of credit are considered borrowings for purposes of the revolving credit agreement 
a total of million in letters of credit was outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at december   million of which was related to the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in connection with the ownership transfer of the sh g a helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment 
total average borrowings for the comparable period in under the former revolving credit agreement totaled approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging our eight quarterly variable rate interest payments on the term loan agreement due in and these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are intended to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings and minimize the negative impact on our earnings and cash flows of interest rate fluctuations attributable to the changes in libor rates 
other sources uses of capital we expect to contribute million to the qualified pension plan and million to the serp for the plan year 
for the plan year  we made a contribution of million to the qualified plan and contributions of million to the serp 
in november  our board of directors approved a replenishment of our stock repurchase program  providing for repurchase of an aggregate of million common shares for use in administration of our stock plans and for general corporate purposes 
there were no shares repurchased during or under this program 
at december   approximately million shares were authorized for repurchase under this program 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec 
this shelf registration statement allows us to offer  issue or sell from time to time  together or separately  i senior or subordinated debt securities  which may be convertible into shares of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities  ii shares of our common stock  iii shares of our preferred stock  which we may issue in one or more series  or iv warrants to purchase our equity or debt securities or other securities 
the total offering price of the securities will not exceed million in the aggregate 
the shelf registration became effective on august  future offerings  if any  will be made only by means of a written prospectus or other permitted documents 
at the time of any such offering  we will file a prospectus supplement with the sec outlining the type of securities  amounts  prices  use of proceeds and other terms

e as previously reported  we reached an agreement with the commonwealth of australia in providing for the termination of the sh g a super seasprite program 
pursuant to the agreement  the commonwealth transferred ownership of the sh g a super seasprite helicopters to the company  together with spare parts and associated equipment  in exchange for a release of any remaining payment obligation for net unbilled receivables totaling approximately million 
the transfer of ownership was completed on february  and we are actively engaged in efforts to resell the aircraft  spare parts and equipment to other potential customers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the commonwealth of australia  we have agreed to share all proceeds from the resale of the aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis  and total payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales  of which at least million aud must be paid by march to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud  additional payments of million aud each must be paid in march of and in late  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts that limit the foreign currency risks associated with these required payments to million

critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures based upon historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant 
we are also responsible for evaluating the propriety of our estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the most significant areas currently involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
long term contracts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based upon either the cost to cost method  in which profit is recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our significant long term contracts 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 
the percentage of completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract 
revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price  with consideration being given to exercised contract options  change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers  engineers  and financial professionals 
estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
the complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and uncertainty as to the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company s ability to estimate future contract costs 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to calculate our long term revenues and costs  estimating the percentage of work complete on certain programs is a complex task 
as a result  changes to these programs could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
these programs include the sikorsky canadian mh program  the sikorsky blackhawk program  the jpf program  and several other programs including the boeing a program 
estimating the ultimate total cost of these programs has been challenging partially due to the complexity of the programs  the ramping up of the new programs  the nature of the materials needed to complete these programs  change orders related to the programs and the need to manage our customers expectations 
these programs are an important element in our continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base 
management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable balance 
these estimates are based on known past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors impacting the credit risk associated with specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends for trade receivables  we perform ongoing reviews of account balances and the aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within a pre determined time frame based upon the credit terms extended 
for our government and commercial contracts  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of recoverable costs 
the recoverability of costs is evaluated on a contract by contract basis based upon historical trends of payments  program viability and the customer s credit worthiness 
write offs are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks associated with specific customers 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was percent and percent of gross receivables  respectively 
receivables written off  net of recoveries  in and were and million  respectively 
currently we do not believe that we have a significant amount of risk relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a change in the allowance would have a million effect on pre tax earnings 
inventory valuation methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have four types of inventory a merchandise for resale  b contracts in process  c other work in process  and d finished goods 
merchandise for resale is stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value 
contracts in process  other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material  labor and overhead  including general and administrative expenses on certain government contracts 
contracts in process  other work in process  and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we include raw material amounts in the contracts in process and other work in process balances 
raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date 
the total amount of raw material included in these in process amounts is less than of the total inventory balance for and the process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value issues often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
we adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value 
changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write downs of inventory value 
based upon a market evaluation performed in we wrote down our k max inventory by million in that year 
the k max inventory balance  consisting of work in process and finished goods  was million as of december  we believe that it is stated at net realizable value  although lack of demand for spare parts in the future could result in additional write downs of the inventory value 
overall  management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued and not subject to further obsolescence in the near term on february   we completed the transfer of title to the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopters  including related inventory and equipment 
at december   million of sh g i inventory  formerly sh g a  was included in contracts and other work in process inventory 
we believe there is market potential for these aircraft and we are actively marketing them to interested potential customers  however a significant portion of this inventory will be sold after december   based upon the time needed to market the aircraft and prepare them for sale 
inventory valuation at our industrial distribution segment generally requires less subjective management judgment than the valuation of certain inventory in the aerospace segment 
management reviews the k max inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write downs are necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december  inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in management reviewed the sh g i inventory balance at december  to determine that no write down was necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december  inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in self insured retentions liabilities methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions to limit our exposure to losses related to health  workers compensation  auto and product general liability claims we obtain third party insurance coverage 
we have varying levels of deductibles for these claims 
our total liability deductible for workers compensation is limited to million per claim  and for general liability and auto liability we are limited to million per claim 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr during such period 
the estimates for the cost of the claims are based upon information provided to us by the claims administrators and are periodically revised to reflect changes in loss trends 
our ibnr estimate is based upon historical trends 
liabilities associated with these claims are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and the possibility that actuarial assumptions could change 
such self insurance accruals likely include claims for which the losses will be settled over a period of years 
the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserve would affect our pre tax earnings by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
all intangible assets are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in conditions indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the annual evaluation is generally performed during the fourth quarter  using currently available forecast information 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment level 
a component of an operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
based upon its annual evaluation  management has determined that there has been no impairment of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
management s estimate of fair value using the discounted cash flow method is based upon factors such as projected revenue and operating margin growth rates reflecting our internal forecasts  terminal growth rates and market participant weighted average cost of capital as our discount rate 
we utilize currently available information regarding present industry and economic conditions and future expectations to prepare our estimates and perform impairment evaluations 
management believes this technique is the most appropriate due to the lack of comparable sales transactions in the market or publicly traded companies with comparable operating and investment characteristics for which operating data is available to derive valuation multiples for the reporting units being tested 
there have been no updates or changes to our methodology during in preparing our annual evaluation we used an assumed terminal growth rate of for our reporting units 
the discount rate utilized to reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections ranged from for our aerospace reporting units and for our industrial distribution reporting units 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our test for goodwill impairment 
in preparing our annual evaluation for we used an assumed terminal growth rate of for our reporting units 
the discount rate utilized to reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections was for our aerospace reporting units and for our industrial distribution reporting units 
the change in the discount rate  when compared to the current year  was due to the risk and uncertainty in our internally developed financial projection resulting from the severity of the economic downturn during and our estimate as to when a broader economic recovery will impact our reporting units in and beyond 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets 
a decrease of in our terminal growth rate or an increase of in our discount rate would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units 
additionally  a decrease in the fair value of our reporting units also would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions or if current economic conditions persist  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
long term incentive programs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company maintains a stock incentive plan  which provides for share based payment awards  including non statutory stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  and long term incentive program ltip awards 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using a black scholes model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted share awards at the date of grant using an average of the high and low market price of our stock 
ltip awards provide certain senior executives an opportunity to receive award payments  generally in cash 
for each performance cycle  the company s financial results are compared to the russell indices for the same periods based upon the following a average return on total capital  b earnings per share growth and c total return to shareholders 
no awards will be payable unless the company s performance is at least in the th percentile of the designated indices 
the maximum award is payable if performance reaches the th percentile of the designated indices 
awards for performance between the th and th percentiles are determined by straight line interpolation 
awards will be paid out at at the th percentile 
in order to estimate the liability associated with ltip awards  management must make assumptions as to how our current performance compares to current russell data based upon the russell s historical results 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
when sufficient russell data for a year is available  which typically will not be until april or may of the following year  management will adjust the liability to reflect its best estimate of the total award 
actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates 
the total estimated liability as of december  was million 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
our long term incentive plan requires management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving long term company goals as well as estimate the impact the russell results may have on our accrual 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in due to the timing of availability of the russell data  there is a risk that the amount we have recorded as ltip expense could be different from the actual payout 
a percentage point increase in the total performance factor earned for our ltip would result in a reduction of pretax earnings of million 
pension plans methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan for our full time us employees with the exception of certain acquired companies that have not adopted the plan and employees of our industrial distribution segment hired after june  as well as a non qualified supplemental employees retirement plan serp for certain key executives 
expenses and liabilities associated with each of these plans are determined based upon actuarial valuations 
integral to these actuarial valuations are a variety of assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels 
we regularly review these assumptions  which are updated at the measurement date  december st  and disclosed in note  pension plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of differences between actual results and the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods  which will affect expense recognized in future periods 
we believe that two assumptions  the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension obligation 
for  management reviewed the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index to determine the continued appropriateness of our discount rate assumptions 
this index was designed to provide a market average discount rate to assist plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities associated with postretirement obligations 
additionally  we reviewed the change in the general level of interest rates since the last measurement date noting that overall rates had remained consistent with based upon this information  we used a discount rate as of december  for the qualified benefit pension plan 
this rate takes into consideration the participants in our pension plan and the anticipated payment stream as compared to the citigroup index and rounds the results to the nearest fifth basis point 
for the serp  we used the same methodology as the pension plan and derived a discount rate of in for the benefit obligation 
the difference in the discount rates is primarily due to the expected duration of serp payments  which is shorter than the anticipated duration of benefit payments to be made to the average participant in the pension plan 
the qualified defined benefit pension plan and serp both used discount rates of at december  for purposes of calculating the benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed based upon several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  our historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium and an inflation estimate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension expense in by million 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
the expected return on plan assets was for december  a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed return on pension plan assets assumption would have changed pension expense in by approximately million 
with the significant downturn in the financial markets in  the market value of our pension plan assets decreased significantly 
the actual return on pension plan assets during was significantly lower than our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 
however  management believes that is still a valid assumption for the expected return on pension plan assets due to the long term nature of our benefit obligations and the likely returns associated with our allocation targets to various investments 
income taxes methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions tax laws in certain of our operating jurisdictions require items to be reported for tax purposes at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
one example of such temporary differences is depreciation expense 
other differences are permanent  such as expenses that are never deductible on our tax returns  an example being a charge related to the impairment of goodwill 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment is not yet due or the realized tax benefit of expenses we have already reported in our tax returns  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
as of december   we had recognized million of net deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those foreign countries or us states where the expiration of tax loss or credit carry forwards or the projected operating results indicates that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was for our effective tax rate is based on expected or reported income or loss  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are valid and defensible  we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or changes in tax legislation 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
we do not anticipate a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
we file tax returns in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions  with returns subject to examination for varying periods  but generally back to and including it is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes 
a one percent increase decrease in our tax rate would affect our earnings by million 
environmental costs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations 
as a result  we have established and update  as necessary  policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide 
when we become aware of an environmental risk  we perform a site study to ascertain the potential magnitude of contamination and the estimated cost of remediation 
this cost is accrued using a reasonable discount factor based on the estimated future cost of remediation 
we continually evaluate the identified environmental issues to ensure the time to complete the remediation and the total cost of remediation are consistent with our initial estimate 
if there is any change in the cost and or timing of remediation  the accrual is adjusted accordingly 
environmental costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
liabilities with fixed or readily determinable payment dates are discounted 
at december   amounts accrued for known environmental remediation costs were million 
a change in this accrual could have impacted pre tax earnings by million 
further information about our environmental costs is provided in note  environmental costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive position  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the most significant accrual for remediation relates to our purchase of the navy property in as more fully discussed in note  environmental costs  and note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivatives and hedging methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we use derivatives to manage risks related to foreign exchange  our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries and interest rates 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivative accounting are complex 
if a derivative does not meet the complex requirements established as a prerequisite for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative must be reported in earnings rather than as a component of other comprehensive income  without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting  we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing 
for a relationship that does not meet these criteria  we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset  within a specified range  changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
this test is conducted each reporting period 
if fair value changes fail this test  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 
fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market based assumptions 
at december   derivative assets were million and derivative liabilities were million 
we had recorded a net loss of million  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
the amount recorded to other comprehensive income would have been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  had the criteria for hedge accounting not been met 
changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recorded to other comprehensive income until the point where either the company stops utilizing the derivative instruments as a hedge or the derivative instruments no longer provide an effective hedge against the impact of foreign currency changes on the underlying transaction 
during  certain derivative financial instruments no longer met the criteria necessary to qualify for hedge accounting 
the company recorded changes in the fair value of these instruments prospectively to the consolidated statements of operations
