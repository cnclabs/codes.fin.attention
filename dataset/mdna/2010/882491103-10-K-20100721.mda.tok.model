item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the united states through our three business segments cement  aggregates and consumer products 
our principal products are gray portland cement  produced and sold through our cement segment  stone  sand and gravel  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and ready mix concrete  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
other products include expanded shale and clay lightweight aggregates  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and packaged concrete mix  mortar  sand and related products  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
our facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california 
we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates 
our business requires large amounts of capital investment  energy  labor and maintenance 
during fiscal year and into fiscal year  the economy in all of our operating regions was in recession 
declining home values  investor losses on mortgage related securities  tight credit conditions  state budget shortfalls  rising unemployment and other factors led to declines in all segments of construction activity in our markets 
these conditions impacted all segments of our business 
in response  we took numerous steps to manage our production to more closely match market demand  reduce costs and manage our cash position 
we significantly reduced both capital and non capital spending  including delaying construction of the expansion of our hunter  texas cement plant 
we idled plants where necessary and reduced our employee and contract labor force by approximately 
we also significantly reduced overtime pay  implemented a salary freeze for non union employees and renegotiated a number of supply and service agreements 
our president and chief executive officer voluntarily reduced his salary by and other executive officers similarly reduced their salaries by 
we negotiated amendments to our senior secured revolving credit facility to reduce the risk that the market decline would cause our operating results to fall below levels required by financial covenants 
during fiscal year  the national economy began to pull out of the recession  but construction activity has remained at low levels 
as a consequence  we have continued with the steps that we began taking in fiscal year in response to the recession 
these steps and others are indicative of our intense focus on cost reduction  management of our cash position and management of production levels  which we believe had a significant positive impact on our operating results in the last two fiscal years 
in october we commenced construction on a project to expand our hunter  texas cement plant 
we plan to expand the hunter plant by approximately million tons of advanced dry process annual cement production capacity 
the  tons of existing production will remain in operation 
when completed  the hunter plant will be a modern  low cost facility  similar to our midlothian and oro grande dry process facilities  and we will be well positioned to cost effectively supply the southern and central texas market 
in may we temporarily halted construction on the project because we believed that economic and market conditions made it unlikely that current cement demand levels in texas would permit the new kiln to operate profitably if the project was completed as originally scheduled 
we expect to resume construction by november we have not entered into a new construction contract to complete the construction  so no schedule for completion has yet been determined 
as of may   we had incurred million  excluding capitalized interest of million  related to the project  of which million had been paid 
until we determine the period over which the construction will occur  we cannot accurately estimate the cost of completing the project 

table of contents results of operations management uses segment operating profit as its principal measure to assess performance and to allocate resources 
business segment operating profit consists of net sales less operating costs and expenses that are directly attributable to the segment 
corporate includes non operating income and expenses related to administrative  financial  legal  human resources environmental and real estate activities 
certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
during fiscal year  the economy in both our california and texas market areas continued to be challenging 
in addition  abnormally inclement weather further impacted already depressed construction activity during the six month and three month periods ended february  in our texas and california market areas  respectively 
we have continued to manage our production to more closely match market demand  reduce costs and manage our cash position 
we believe these steps have had a significant positive impact on our cash flows in the current fiscal year

our financial security plan postretirement benefit obligations are determined using assumptions as of the end of the year 
in  it was discovered that our actuarial assumptions for certain participants failed to consider that these participants will receive their defined benefit for a minimum of years or life 
previously  our calculations had incorrectly assumed that the payments to these participants ceased after years 
we have recomputed the defined benefit liability for these participants and have accordingly recognized a charge of million in to record the additional liability 
management estimates that million of this additional liability relates to years prior to this million would have accumulated over time since the year the million increase related to was primarily a function of the decreased discount rate in compared to the discount rate in management determined that the amount related to prior years was not material to the financial statements and the entire change has been recognized in selling  general and administrative expense in financial security plan postretirement benefit expense excluding this adjustment increased million in and decreased million in from the prior fiscal years

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we used the last in  first out lifo method to value finished products  work in process and raw material inventories excluding natural aggregate inventories 
natural aggregate inventories and parts and supplies inventories are valued using the average cost method 
our natural aggregate inventory excludes volumes in excess of an average twelve month period of actual sales 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets on a facility by facility basis for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management evaluated the hunter  texas cement plant  including the capitalized construction and interest costs associated with the expansion that is currently suspended 
we expect the texas market to recover to pre recession levels and to complete the expansion project 
while the specific timing of the completion has not been determined  we anticipate completing the project within years 
based on historical margins  we believe the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the hunter plant after completion of the expansion will significantly exceed the current investment in the plant as well as the remaining costs of the expansion and future capital expenditures necessary to achieve these cash flows 
goodwill and goodwill impairment 
management tests goodwill for impairment annually by reporting unit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 

table of contents based on an impairment test performed as of may   an impairment charge of million was recognized with respect to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of riverside cement company and identified with our california cement operations 
the fair value of the reporting unit declined compared to prior evaluations  the most recent of which was as of november   due to a change in assumptions regarding the timing of cash flows expected to be derived from the reporting unit 
the extreme depth of the recession in california was better understood at this time and resulted in the expected timing of a full recovery in the california cement market to be later than previously anticipated 
the resulting present value of the projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the goodwill and a full impairment charge was recognized 
goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ready mix operations in texas and louisiana and identified with our consumer products operations has a carrying value of million at both may  and may  based on an impairment test performed as of march   the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 
recently issued accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
this accounting guidance was effective for our company on june  however  in february  the fasb delayed the effective date of the new guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the new guidance became effective for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on june  the adoption of this new accounting policy for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities has not had a current material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance that permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this new accounting guidance was effective for our company on june  we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments or other items permitted under this guidance  therefore  its adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million at may   our sources of liquidity include cash from operations and borrowings available under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
on june   we amended and restated our credit agreement and the associated security agreement 
the credit agreement continues to provide for a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a million sub limit for letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans 
the credit facility matures on august  amounts drawn under the credit facility bear annual interest either at the libor rate plus a margin of to or at a base rate plus a margin of to 
the base rate is the higher of the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate established by bank of america  na or the rate for one month libor loans plus 
the interest rate margins are determined based on our leverage ratio 
the commitment fee calculated on the unused portion of the credit facility ranges from to per year based on our leverage ratio 
we may terminate the credit facility at any time 
the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility is limited to an amount based on the value of our consolidated accounts receivable  inventory and mobile equipment 
this amount  called the borrowing base  may be less than the million stated principal amount of the credit facility 
the borrowing base under our amended agreement was million as of may  we are not required to maintain any financial ratios or covenants unless an event of default occurs or the unused portion of the borrowing base is less than million  in which case we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to at may   our fixed charge coverage ratio was
