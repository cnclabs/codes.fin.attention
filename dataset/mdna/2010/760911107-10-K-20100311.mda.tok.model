item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read as an integral part of the discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial position 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the company has entered into a number of license agreements covering potential products using the company s spd technology 
the company receives fees and minimum annual royalties under certain license agreements and records fee income on a ratable basis each quarter 
in instances when sales of licensed products by its licensees exceed minimum annual royalties  the company recognizes fee income as the amounts have been earned 
certain of the fees are accrued by  or paid to  the company in advance of the period in which they are earned resulting in deferred revenue 
the company expenses costs relating to the development or acquisition of patents due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of these items 
all of our research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal and external research and development 
these costs include direct and indirect overhead expenses 
the company has historically used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years 
on occasion  the company may issue to consultants either options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the company at specified share prices 
these options or warrants may vest based upon specific services being performed or performance criteria being met 
in accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the company would be required to record consulting expenses based upon the fair value of such options or warrants on the earlier of the service period or the period that such options or warrants vest as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
an example of a critical estimate is the full valuation allowance for deferred taxes that was recorded based on the uncertainty that such tax benefits will be realized in future periods 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company s fee income from licensing activities for was  as compared to  for this difference in fee income was primarily the result of the receipt  in  of a one time payment from a former licensee in full settlement of past due minimum annual royalties for several years  the expiration of an agreement with hitachi chemical regarding payments made by hitachi chemical to the company for guaranteed access to future improvements in the company s technology  the timing and amount of minimum annual royalties paid  and the date of receipt of such payment on certain license agreements  by end product licensees 
certain license fees  which are paid to the company in advance of the accounting period in which they are earned can result in the recognition of deferred revenue for the current accounting period  which will be recognized as fee income in future periods 
also  licensees may offset some or all of their royalty payments on sales of licensed products for a given period by applying these advance payments towards such earned royalty payments 
because the company s license agreements typically provide for the payment of royalties by a licensee on product sales within days after the end of the quarter in which a sale of a licensed product occurs with some of the company s more recent license agreements providing for payments on a monthly basis  and because of the time period which typically will elapse between a customer order and the sale of the licensed product and installation in a home  office building  automobile  aircraft  boat or any other product  there could be a delay between when economic activity between a licensee and its customer occurs and when the company gets paid its royalty resulting from such activity

the company s working capital and capital requirements depend upon numerous factors  including the results of research and development activities  competitive and technological developments  the timing and cost of patent filings  the development of new licensees and changes in the company s relationships with its existing licensees 
the degree of dependence of the company s working capital requirements on each of the foregoing factors cannot be quantified  increased research and development activities and related costs would increase such requirements  the addition of new licensees may provide additional working capital or working capital requirements  and changes in relationships with existing licensees would have a favorable or negative impact depending upon the nature of such changes 
based upon existing levels of cash expenditures  existing cash reserves and budgeted revenues  and the proceeds raised from the sale of stock and warrants on march   the company believes that it would not require additional funding until the third quarter of there can be no assurance that expenditures will not exceed the anticipated amounts or that additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the company
