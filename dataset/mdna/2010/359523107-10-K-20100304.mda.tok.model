table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech  inc fuel tech has two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineering solutions to meet the pollution control  efficiency improvement and operational optimization needs of energy related facilities worldwide 
they are as follows air pollution control technologies the air pollution control technology segment includes technologies to reduce nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources 
these include low and ultra low nox burners lnb and ulnb  over fire air ofa systems  noxout and hert tm selective non catalytic reduction sncr systems  and advanced selective catalytic reduction ascr tm systems 
the ascr system includes ulnb  ofa  and sncr components  along with a downsized scr catalyst  ammonia injection grid aig  and graduated straightening grid gsg tm systems to provide high nox reductions at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional scr systems 
the cascade tm and noxout scr processes are basic types of ascr systems  using just sncr and scr catalyst components 
ultra technology creates ammonia at a plant site using safe urea for use with any scr application 
flue gas conditioning systems are chemical injection systems offered in markets outside the us and canada to enhance electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter performance in controlling particulate emissions 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
fuel chem technologies the fuel chem technology segment  which uses chemical processes in combination with advanced cfd and ckm boiler modeling  for the control of slagging  fouling  corrosion  opacity and other sulfur trioxide related issues in furnaces and boilers through the addition of chemicals into the furnace using tifi targeted in furnace injection technology 
fuel tech sells its fuel chem program through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
at december   fuel chem programs were installed on over combustion units around the world  treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels  including coal  heavy oil  biomass and municipal waste 
the fuel chem program improves the efficiency  reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility  industrial  pulp and paper  waste to energy  university and district heating markets and offers numerous operational  financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers  furnaces and other combustion units 
the key market dynamic for both technology segments is the continued use of fossil fuels  especially coal  as the principal fuel source for global electricity production 
coal accounts for approximately of all us electricity generation 
coal s share of global electricity generation is forecast to be approximately by major coal consumers include china  the united states and india 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
we routinely discuss our critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues from the sales of chemical products are recorded when title transfers  either at the point of shipment or at the point of destination  depending on the contract with the customer 
fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the air pollution control technology segment 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
revisions in completion estimates and contract values in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revisions become known can influence the timing of when revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of december   fuel tech had one construction contract in progress that was identified as a loss contract in the amount of as of december   fuel tech had no construction contracts in progress that were identified as loss contracts 

table of contents fuel tech s apc contracts are typically six to twelve months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical operational measurements that  when achieved  serve as the basis for us to invoice the customer via progress billings 
at a minimum  these measurements will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual apc project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by us are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables  representing revenues recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
at december  and december   unbilled receivables were approximately  and  respectively 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts were and  at december  and december   respectively 
such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
fuel tech has installed over units with apc technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  we perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
we believe that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with our customer base  we review the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of our management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
our historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the company does not have any indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
such indicators include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
fuel tech has two reporting units which are reported in the fuel chem segment and the apc technology segment 
as of december  and  goodwill allocated to the fuel chem technology segment was  and  respectively  while goodwill allocated to the apc technology segment was  and  respectively 
the  increase in goodwill in the apc technology segment is due to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of advanced combustion technology  inc on january  the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the carrying value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units as this methodology was deemed to best quantify the present values of the company s expected future cash flows and yield a fair value that should be in line with the aggregate market value placed on the company via the current stock price multiplied by the outstanding common shares 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
events outside the company s control  specifically market conditions that impact revenue growth assumptions  could significantly impact the fair value calculated 
these assumptions are  however  somewhat insensitive to these external events in all but the most egregious situations due to the relatively conservative nature upon which such future growth assumptions were developed 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
the application of our dcf model in estimating the fair value of each reporting segment is based on the income approach to business valuation 
in using this approach for each reportable segment  we forecast segment revenues and expenses out to perpetuity and then discount the resulting cash flows back using an appropriate discount rate 
the forecast considers  among other items  the current and expected business environment  expected changes in the fixed and variable cost structure as the business grows and a revenue growth rate that we feel is both achievable and sustainable 
the discount rate used is composed of a number of identifiable risk factors  including equity risk and small company premiums  that when added together  results in a total return that a prudent investor would demand for an investment in our company 

table of contents in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair values assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
based upon the nature of the goodwill recorded on the balance sheets as of december  and  the company believes that  in order for an impairment to occur  a series of material prolonged negative economic events would have to occur 
these events would most likely be seen in economic indicators such as suppressed consolidated revenues or common stock price  reduced cash flows or declining apc order backlog 
management does not believe that as pertains to fuel tech s business that certain negative economic events related to the global economic downturn are likely to be prolonged 
impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment pp e and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets asset groups may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset asset group and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
when quoted market prices are not available  various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows  are utilized 
this process involves examining the operating condition of individual assets and estimating a fair value based upon its current condition  relevant market factors and remaining estimated operational life compared to remaining depreciable life 
however  due to the nature of our pp e  which is comprised mainly of assets related to our headquarters building and equipment deployed at customer locations for our fuel chem programs  and the shorter term duration over which fuel chem equipment is depreciated  the likelihood of impairment is low 
the discontinuation of a fuel chem program at a customer site would most likely result in the re deployment of all or most of the effected assets to another customer location rather than an impairment 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of each reporting period  fuel tech reviews the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as part of this review  we consider if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carry back the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies that can be readily implemented 
stock based compensation fuel tech recognizes compensation expense for employee equity awards ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards 
determining the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model requires judgment  including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option  expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of fuel tech s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option  and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap authoritative and non authoritative and making the accounting standards codification asc the source of authoritative  non governmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission 
this guidance  which was incorporated into accounting standards codification topic  generally accepted accounting principles  was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption changed certain disclosure references to us gaap  but did not have any other effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance related to variable interest entities vie  which requires entities to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a vie 
the guidance also requires an ongoing reassessment of variable interests and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this guidance  which was incorporated into asc topic  consolidation  will be effective as of the beginning of an entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  january  for the company 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued

versus revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year over year decrease of  or  was driven by reduced orders in the apc technology segment 
revenues for the apc technology segment were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  versus fiscal the global financial crisis coupled with domestic regulatory uncertainty regarding the eventual timing of the implementation of the clean air interstate rule cair contributed to an across the board slowdown of capital project orders for pollution control equipment from our customer base which had a negative effect on segment revenues and the apc order backlog 
while revenues are down from the prior year  this segment remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the next phase of increasingly stringent us and chinese air quality standards  specifically on nox control 
interest in fuel tech s suite of pollution control technologies  on both a new and retrofit basis  remains strong  both domestically and abroad  and quotation and order activity was substantially in excess of that experienced in during  fuel tech announced new apc contracts valued at approximately  revenues for the fuel chem technology segment for the year ended december  were  substantially on par with the record revenues reported for the year ended december  of  this segment s ability to generate revenues comparable to prior year levels demonstrates the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  particularly on coal fired units  which represent the largest market opportunity for the technology 
during  fuel tech added new units to its customer base  four of which were coal fired units 
the addition of these customer units  which historically average approximately  in annual revenues once converted to commercial status  and increased project demonstration activity helped mitigate the decrease in demand for electricity  largely related to the economic recession  that has dictated that certain fuel tech customers shut down or scale back some boiler operations 
this  in turn  has resulted in some fuel chem programs being operated at reduced levels or  in some cases  being temporarily turned off 
historically  most demonstrations convert into commercial accounts 
during a fuel chem demonstration period  the company will typically absorb all of the direct costs eg  chemicals  on site personnel  equipment depreciation and demonstration related travel expenses and indirect costs of operating the demonstration and will offset these costs with partial billings to the customer 
while each demonstration is unique  a typical demonstration will operate for days and the company will accumulate future billing amounts that will usually be invoiced to the customer only if the fuel chem program converts to commercial status 
these amounts may range from less than to over  depending on the quantity of chemical fed  the agreed upon cost sharing arrangement and the length of the demonstration program 
during the demonstration period  the aggregate cost of all fuel chem demonstration programs will have a dilutive effect on the segment gross margin percentage as the related revenues earned will approximate the costs incurred and result in nominal gross margin dollars being recorded 
in certain situations  the company agrees to fully fund a demonstration program due to the strategic importance of its success and conversion to commercial status 
in these cases  the specific program s recognized revenues will be zero and the gross margin dollar contribution will be negative by the amount of the program s cost  thus even further diluting the segment s gross margin percentage

cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the apc technology segment increased to in from in the increase is attributed to the mix of lower margin project business  including one large contract with a significant amount of lower margin installation work and the pass through of approximately million in catalyst sales at a nominal mark up percentage 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the fuel chem technology segment increased to in from in primarily due to increased chemical manufacturing costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  is attributed to the following personnel and other expenses related to the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of tackticks llc  flowtack llc  and act contributed additional incremental expenses of  for fiscal the implementation of a new sales commission program for both the apc and fuel chem technology segments resulted in an increase of in commission expense 
the company also incurred year over year increases in depreciation expense of driven by the acceleration of leasehold improvement amortization expense related to the termination of the current stamford office lease  legal fees of due to international contracts and acquisition related activities  and accounting and auditing fees of primarily related to acquisition related activities 
partially offsetting these amounts were a one time gain from the revaluation of the contingent liability related to the act acquisition 
research and development expenses were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in expenditures is due to the company moderating its near term r d expenditures in the wake of the global financial crisis 
however  fuel tech maintained its focused approach in the pursuit of commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  and in the development and analysis of new technologies that could represent incremental market opportunities domestically and abroad 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased by to versus predominantly due to reductions in cash balances on hand as a result of the cash outlay for the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of tackticks  llc and flowtack  llc  and act coupled with a decrease in the average return in the company s interest bearing accounts in which the cash is invested 
interest expense of was recorded in primarily due to the debt incurred to start up activities at fuel tech s office in beijing  china 
finally  the modest change in other income expense is due to the impact of foreign exchange rates as it relates to balances denominated in foreign currencies and is translation  not transaction  in nature 
for the year end december   fuel tech recorded an income tax benefit of  on the company s pre tax loss of 
for the year ended december   fuel tech recorded income tax expense of  on pre tax income of  versus revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year over year increase of  or  was driven by a increase in revenues from the fuel chem technology segment that were largely offset by a modest revenue decline in the apc technology segment 
revenues for the apc technology segment were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  versus the global financial crisis and the vacatur of the clean air interstate rule cair in july subsequently remanded in december had a negative effect on segment revenues and apc order backlog 
this segment is well positioned to capitalize on cair the next phase of increasingly stringent us air quality standards which is effective january   and the clean air visibility rule cavr  which is effective january  thousands of utility and industrial boilers will be impacted by these regulations and fuel tech s technologies will serve as an important element in enabling utility and industrial boiler unit owners to attain compliance 
during  fuel tech announced new contracts valued at approximately  revenues for the fuel chem technology segment were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  versus this segment s growth is indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  particularly on coal fired units  which represent the largest market opportunity for the technology  both domestically and abroad 
during  fuel tech added new units to its customer base  of which were coal fired units  the largest annual total in the company s history

the cost of sales percentage for the apc technology segment increased to from in the increase is attributable to the mix of project business 
the cost of sales percentage for the fuel chem technology segment increased from in to in due to incremental costs associated with demonstration programs and other related start up activities related to the record number of new incremental units noted above  especially for the demonstrations in india and china 
during  the company invested and  primarily in engineering labor and chemicals  for fuel chem demonstration programs in india and china  respectively 
in addition  the aggregate fuel chem demonstration expenses for new units in the us was approximately these demonstration programs resulted in a cost of sales percentage increase of versus selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the  increase over is principally attributable to the following fuel tech recorded  in stock compensation expense in in accordance with asc  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this amount represented a  increase over  attributable to stock option awards to directors and certain fuel tech employees in and the on going expense recognition related to stock options awarded in prior years 
fuel tech invested approximately  in personnel and other costs  including expenses associated with the start up of the company s beijing  china office  in the areas of engineering  sales  marketing and administration to ensure the company s financial and operational infrastructure are able to accommodate anticipated future growth 
partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a reduction in annual incentive expenses of  as the minimum income threshold for the year ended december  was not met and  thus  no bonus payments were made under the company s incentive plan 
the company also incurred incremental year over year expense increases in the following areas consulting services increased driven by expertise required in certain foreign countries for initial market penetration and domestic financial advisory services  acquisition related expenses of  insurance expense increased due to general inflation  the addition of new policies  increased coverage on certain policies and an increase in insurable assets  recruiting fees increased due to the costs associated with adding one new member to our board of directors and the hiring of a new chief financial officer  and non income taxes increased due primarily to a foreign business tax increase and additional real estate taxes on the company s new headquarters facility
