item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of key factors  drivers and risks regarding the company and the building wire industry 
executive overview encore wire sells a commodity product in a highly competitive market 
management strongly believes that the historical strength of the company s growth and earnings is attributable to the following main factors industry leading order fill rates and responsive customer service 
product innovations based on listening to and understanding customer needs 
low cost manufacturing operations  resulting from a state of the art manufacturing plant 
a focused management team leading an incentivized work force 
low general and administrative overhead costs 
a team of experienced independent manufacturers representatives with strong customer relationships across the united states 
these factors  and others  have allowed encore wire to grow from a startup in to what management believes is one of the largest copper electric building wire companies in the united states of america 
encore has built a loyal following of customers throughout the united states 
these customers have developed a brand preference for encore wire in a commodity product line  due to the reasons noted above  among others 
the company prides itself on striving to grow sales by expanding its product offerings where profit margins are acceptable 
senior management monitors gross margins daily  frequently extending down to the individual order level 
management strongly believes that this focused approach to the building wire business has produced success thus far and will lead to continued success 
the construction and remodeling industries drive demand for building wire 
housing construction activity in the united states softened significantly in and continued its downward trend through nationally  commercial construction had been relatively strong through  but slowed significantly in and according to various industry and national economic forecasts the future is unclear for the next few years 
the credit crisis and the resulting tightening of credit could negatively impact the availability of capital to fund construction projects for some time to come 
data on remodeling is not as readily available  however  remodeling activity tends to trend up when new construction slows down 
general price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense  and the company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices 
copper  a commodity product  is the principal raw material used by the company in manufacturing its products 
copper accounted for approximately  and of the company s cost of goods sold during fiscal  and  respectively 
the price of copper fluctuates  depending on general economic conditions and in relation to supply and demand and other factors  which causes monthly variations in the cost of copper purchased by the company 
in  copper prices began the year at what proved to be a low point and then moved upward and traded in a fairly wide range during the year with significant volatility 
in  copper prices rose during the first quarter and then held at high levels through early july  before beginning a precipitous decline through the rest of the year falling from a comex close of per pound on july st to close at per pound on december st 
this unprecedented swift decline in copper prices mirrored that of many other commodities in the second half of in  copper began at the year end lows and rose gradually throughout the year  mirroring the rebound in global commodity prices 
the company cannot predict copper prices in the future or the effect of fluctuations in the cost of copper on the company s future operating results 
wire prices can  and frequently do change on a daily basis 
this competitive pricing market for wire does not always mirror changes in copper prices  making margins highly volatile 
with the volatility of both raw material prices and wire prices in the company s end market  hedging raw materials can be risky 
historically  the company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases
