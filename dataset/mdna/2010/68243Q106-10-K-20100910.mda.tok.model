as a provider of gifts to consumers and wholesalers for resale to consumers  the company is subject to changes in consumer confidence and the economic conditions that impact our customers 
the demand for the company s products is affected by the financial health of our customers  which is influenced by macro economic issues such as unemployment  fuel and energy costs  weakness in the housing market and unavailability of consumer credit 
during the recent economic downturn  the demand for our products has been adversely affected by the reduction in consumer spending  and the company s results reflect the impact of the global economic downturn 
while managing the business in what continues to be a challenging economic landscape  the company remains focused on the three principles that it believes will enable it to achieve long term  profitable growth 
these are know and take care of our customer evidenced by the recent number one ranking in customer satisfaction and service that we received from the stella service independent rating agency 
maintain and enhance our financial strength and flexibility where we completed the sale of our non strategic home and children s gifts business using the proceeds to further pay down our term debt  strengthening our balance sheet and revising our bank credit facility to provide additional flexibility  and continue to innovate and invest for the future in new technology opportunities such as mobile e commerce where we were awarded the retail info systems mobile app of the year in the best shopping category for flowers 
com mobile site  in the successful launch of our new baskets 
com brand in november  and the development of our fannie may retail store franchising program which is being launched in the current fiscal first quarter 
during fiscal  we plan to further invest in these initiatives in combination with additional efforts underway to broaden our product offerings and expand the business channels in which we operate 
we believe the steps we are taking now will provide additional leverage to drive improved top and bottom line performance as the economy improves and thereby enable us to emerge from the current challenging economy with an even stronger position as the world s leading florist and gift shop 
reflecting the continued uncertainty in the consumer economy  the company is modifying how it provides forward guidance compared with past practices 
this includes the elimination of specific guidance for revenues  eps  ebitda and free cash flow 
in terms of its outlook for fiscal  the company does not anticipate significant improvements in consumer demand for discretionary purchases and therefore expects continued challenges to top line growth 
the following tables set forth some of the company s key financial information category information the following table presents the contribution of net revenues  gross profit and category contribution margin or category adjusted ebitda earnings before interest including write off of deferred financing costs  taxes  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible impairment and severance and other restructuring costs from each of the company s business categories 
as noted previously  the company s home children s gifts segment has been classified as discontinued operations and therefore excluded from category information below

prior period results  which had previously been included within the flowers consumer floral category  have been reclassified accordingly 
corporate expenses consist of the company s enterprise shared service cost centers  and include  among other items  information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  legal  executive and customer service center functions  as well as share based compensation 
in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions  other than those of the customer service center  which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage  are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific category 
performance is measured based on category contribution margin or category adjusted ebitda  reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the categories 
as such  management s measure of profitability for these categories does not include the effect of corporate overhead  described above  depreciation and amortization  other income net  nor does it include one time charges 
management utilizes ebitda  and adjusted financial information  as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization 
the company also uses ebitda and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
the company s credit agreement uses ebitda and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda and adjusted financial information is also used by the company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
ebitda and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  the company s working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on the company s debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company s performance 
due to the company s strategic decision to divest its home children s gifts segment and classify it as discontinued operations  as well as other one time charges incurred during fiscal and goodwill and intangible impairment  deferred financing cost write off  severance and other restructuring costs  litigation settlement  and termination of marketing agreements  the following non gaap reconciliation table has been included within md a

during the fiscal years ended june  and june   revenues declined by and over the respective prior year periods  resulting from continued weakness in the retail economy 
during fiscal  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower wholesale order volumes from designpac gifts  which is included within the company s gourmet food gift baskets category  combined with lower demand within the flowers consumer floral business  and from weakness in wholesale product sales within the bloomnet wireservice business 
fiscal was further impacted by the termination of the company s third party marketing program during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the decline was primarily attributable to both order count and average order value across all of the company s e commerce brands as consumers traded down to lower price point products

although these programs resulted in an increase in order count and new customer acquisition  the lift in orders was insufficient to offset the associated decline in average order and gross margin  and combined with the increase in advertising spending required to support the promotion  resulted in significantly lower category contribution margin

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by e commerce operations from the company s online and telephonic sales channels as well as other operations retail wholesale and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
shipping terms are fob shipping point 
net revenues generated by the company s bloomnet wire service operations include membership fees as well as other products and service offerings to florists 
membership fees are recognized monthly in the period earned  and products sales are recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms of fob shipping point 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company performs an annual impairment test during its fiscal fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
stock based compensation the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock price 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and future expectations 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the black scholes model also incorporates expected forfeiture rates  based on historical behavior 
determining these assumptions are subjective and complex  and therefore  a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of the company s stock options 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax as sets 
it is the company s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
to the extent that the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the company adopted the provisions of the accounting standard on fair value measurements that apply to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to establish the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
this guidance only impacted references for accounting guidance 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for business combinations that amends the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance will require such contingencies to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
otherwise  entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance for contingencies 
the guidance became effective for the company s business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after june  the company did not complete any material business combinations during the fiscal year ended june   and the eff ect of this guidance  if any  on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods will depend on the nature and significance of business combinations subject to this guidance 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for general intangibles other than goodwill  amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after june  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and investment grade corporate and us government securities  as well as from outstanding debt 
as of june   the company s outstanding debt  including current maturities  approximated million 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes  but rather to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company manages its floating rate debt using interest rate swaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
in july  the company entered into a million notional amount swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate libor for a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement 
this swap matures on july  the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest libor payments 
the effective portion of the after tax fair value gains or losses on these swaps is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to recla ssify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
exclusive of the impact of the company s interest rate swap agreement  each basis point change in interest rates would have had a corresponding effect on our interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis
