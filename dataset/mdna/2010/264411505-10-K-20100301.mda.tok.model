item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office  medical office and other properties  of which properties with more than million square feet are in service and seven properties with more than million square feet are under development 
the in service properties are comprised of consolidated properties with approximately million square feet and jointly controlled properties with more than million square feet 
the seven properties under development consist of four consolidated properties with approximately  square feet and three jointly controlled properties with more than  square feet 
owned  including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures  approximately  acres of land and controlled an additional  acres through purchase options 
we refined our business strategy in  which includes planned reductions in undeveloped land inventory in light of lower anticipated development volume and the targeting of non strategic property dispositions 
these decisions further align our focus on markets that we believe offer the best long term prospects for rental rate growth and overall demand with an emphasis on industrial and medical office properties 
additionally  we no longer plan to develop properties with the intent to sell them at or near completion 
through our service operations reportable segment  we have historically developed or acquired properties with the intent to sell hereafter referred to as build for sale properties 
build for sale properties were generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and were sold within a relatively short time after being placed in service 
build for sale properties  which are no longer part of our operating strategy  did not represent a significant component of our operations in our service operations reportable segment  which includes our taxable reit subsidiary  also provides the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures property leasing  property management  asset management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
capital strategy our strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure  in conjunction with the execution of our overall operating strategy  while continuing to maintain investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies and to ultimately improve the key metrics that drive these credit ratings 
in support of our capital strategy  as well as our overall business strategy  we employ an asset disposition program to sell non strategic real estate assets  which generates proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our growth objectives in industrial and medical office properties or can be utilized to reduce our leverage 
we seek to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii issuing common equity from time to time to maintain appropriate leverage parameters  and iv generating proceeds from the sale of non strategic properties 
by focusing on strengthening our balance sheet  we expect to be well positioned for future growth 

table of contents operational objectives our primary operational objective is to drive operational efficiencies  by maximizing cash from operations and funds from operations ffo  through i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii selectively developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve or when accretive returns are present  iii using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  and iv providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
year in review overall  the economy and business fundamentals experienced substantial deterioration in  especially in the first six months of the year 
the most significant factor driving operating decisions and results was the lack of available capital in the marketplace 
with a focus on securing our future liquidity position to withstand the continuing challenges in the economy  and to be positioned for future growth  we demonstrated our ability to access multiple capital sources and completed several major financing transactions in these financing transactions  along with asset dispositions completed during the year  generated over billion of new capital in major financing transactions included a common equity issuance that generated million of proceeds  the issuance of million of unsecured notes  million of additional borrowings on secured loans and the renewal of our unsecured line of credit at a borrowing capacity of million through february the refinement of our business strategy  as well as the deep recession and financial market instability that adversely affected real estate values  caused us to recognize asset impairment charges of million in and million in despite the recessionary climate and lack of available capital for buyers  we were able to successfully execute several land and building disposition transactions in that generated million in gross proceeds 
the economic recession and general turmoil in the financial markets that began in late continued to negatively impact the real estate industry throughout there continues to be a tremendous oversupply of space across all product types and in all markets in the commercial real estate industry 
as a result  many owners are willing to offer significant concessions to compete for potential tenants  which is driving down rental rates and resulting in large capital expenditures in many cases 
leasing activity has been slower than anticipated  a reflection of the broader economy  which led to a slight decline in our total occupancy 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended the loss attributable to common shareholders was driven primarily by million of non cash asset impairment charges recognized during the year and a million decrease in total gains on land and building sales 
additionally  we incurred a million increase in interest expense that was driven by a decrease in interest costs capitalized to development projects 
ffo attributable to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for  with the decrease resulting from the same factors that drove the loss attributable to common shareholders in industry analysts and investors use ffo as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the most comparable gaap measure is net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
consolidated basic ffo attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of nareit 

table of contents historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents gaap net income loss  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes that the use of consolidated basic ffo attributable to common shareholders  combined with net income which remains the primary measure of performance  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management believes that  by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  investors and analysts are able to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assist in comparing these operating results between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table shows a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common shareholders to the calculation of consolidated basic ffo attributable to common shareholders for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands net income loss attributable to common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture noncontrolling interest share of adjustments consolidated basic funds from operations attributable to common shareholders during  we continued to execute within our core areas of competency  while planning for the longer term effects of the economic recession 
highlights of our operating activities are as follows we made outright sales  or completed partial sales to unconsolidated joint ventures  of wholly owned buildings for million of gross proceeds and also generated million of gross proceeds from the divestiture of non strategic land parcels 
as a result of refinements to our strategy  combined to a lesser extent with a market wide decline in asset values due to the economic downturn  we recognized million of impairment charges on land  buildings  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets during we have continued to limit our new development starts to selected projects in markets or product types expected to have strong future rent growth and demand or projects that have significant pre leasing 
the total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction was million at december  with million of such costs incurred through that date 
our total estimated cost for jointly controlled properties under construction was million at december  with million of costs incurred through that date 

table of contents the occupancy level for our in service portfolio of consolidated properties decreased from at december  to at december  the decrease was due to the continuation of the trend of recently completed speculative buildings being placed in service and not being fully leased  as well as the impact of the economy on users of office and bulk industrial space 
despite the continued challenges presented by the overall economy  total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled million square feet in compared to million square feet in total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in totaled million square feet of renewals  which represented an success rate and attained a growth in net effective rents 
we engaged in a number of financing activities during to adapt to conditions in the credit markets 
highlights of our key financing activities in are as follows in february  we repaid million of corporate unsecured debt at its scheduled maturity date 
in april  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
during  we borrowed a total of million from six secured debt financings that are secured by rental properties 
the secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 
the composition of these properties as far as product type  geographic location  and overall operating metrics are diverse and similar to our overall portfolio of unsecured properties 
in august  we issued million of unsecured notes in two equal tranches 
the first million of the unsecured notes will mature in february and bear interest at an effective rate of while the other million of the notes mature in august and bear interest at an effective rate of 
during  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in through in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million  recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of approximately million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
partially offsetting the aforementioned gains was a million charge to write off fees paid for a cancelled secured transaction 
in order to strengthen our liquidity position going forward and to preserve cash for future debt maturities  in january the board of directors reduced our annual dividend from per share to per share 
our dividend was further reduced in the second quarter of to per share on an annualized basis which  as a result of the issuance of additional shares in the april common stock offering  was necessary for us to maintain our planned level of aggregate dividend payments for 
table of contents key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial  office  medical office and retail properties collectively referred to as rental operations 
the following discussion highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues 
occupancy analysis as discussed above  our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of consolidated rental properties as of december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data total square feet percent of total square feet percent occupied type industrial   office   other medical office and retail   total the decrease in occupancy at december  compared to december  is primarily the result of developments that were not fully leased being placed in service during and  as well as the effect of the economic downturn on our tenant base 
certain of the developments placed in service during and were built with the intention to sell shortly after completion but  due to the deterioration in economic conditions  were not sold and are being held as rental properties for the foreseeable future 
our ongoing ability to maintain favorable occupancy levels may be adversely affected by the continued effects of the economic recession on current and prospective tenants and such a reduction in the level of occupancy may have an adverse impact on revenues from rental operations 
lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our consolidated in service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of december  the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands  except percentage data total portfolio industrial office other year of expiration square feet ann 
rent revenue of revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue and thereafter total portfolio square feet percent occupied we renewed and of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately million and million square feet in and  respectively 
we attained growth in net effective rents on these renewals during  compared to in growth in net effective rent in was negatively affected by one significant early lease renewal and would have been if that renewal were excluded 
our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate 
the effects of current economic conditions upon our base of existing tenants may adversely affect our ability to continue to achieve this renewal rate 

table of contents future development another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities 
we expect to generate future earnings from rental operations income as the development properties are placed in service and leased 
considering the current state of the economy and the risks presented by constraints on our ability to access capital on favorable terms  we have reduced the level of our new development activities pending improvements in the economy and capital markets and are focused on the lease up of recently completed and under development projects 
we had million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of million at december   compared to million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of million at december  the square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at 
the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data ownership type square feet percent leased total estimated project costs total incurred to date amount remaining to be spent consolidated properties joint venture properties total acquisition and disposition activity gross sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned undeveloped land and buildings totaled million in  compared to million in our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have less than a interest totaled million in  and we had no such dispositions in we intend to continue to pursue disposition opportunities for non strategic properties and land in accordance with our strategy 
we believe that the number of dispositions we execute in will be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing or pay cash  given the current state of the economy and credit markets in particular 
in  we acquired million of income producing properties comprised of three industrial real estate properties in savannah  georgia  compared to acquisitions of million of income producing properties in the same market in we also acquired million of undeveloped land in  compared to million in 
table of contents results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share data rental and related revenue general contractor and service fee revenue operating income loss net income loss attributable to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares and potential dilutive securities basic income loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service consolidated properties at end of year in service consolidated square footage at end of year number of in service joint venture properties at end of year in service joint venture square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue overall  rental and related revenue from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired three properties  consolidated two retail properties in which we previously had a partial ownership interest  and placed developments in service 
the acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of million and million  respectively 
the two retail properties that were consolidated in provided million of incremental revenues 
of the development properties placed in service in  ten were medical office properties accounting for million of the million incremental revenues 
acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided  and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees increased from million in to million in 
table of contents we contributed five properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in  resulting in a million reduction in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase in rental revenues was partially offset by a million increase in expense related to doubtful receivables  including both contractual and straight line receivables  as a result of economic conditions during decreases in rental rates and occupancy in certain of our existing properties  resulting from the economy s impact on the leasing environment  partially offset the above mentioned items 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total of the overall million increase in rental expenses in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from january  through december  of the overall million increase in real estate taxes in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service from january  through december  the remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in tax rates and assessed values on our existing properties 
service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment excluding build for sale properties for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total service operations primarily consist of the leasing  management  development  construction management and general contractor services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
service operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy  as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners and joint venture partners 
earnings from service operations increased from million in to million in the increase in earnings from service operations was primarily a result of general contractor expenses being higher than usual in as a result of increases in our total cost estimates for two third party fixed price construction contracts  which reduced the margins on the contracts 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in due to increases in our real estate asset base from properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service during and equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated companies that generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties for sale 
equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily a result of our share of the gain on sale of five properties from unconsolidated subsidiaries in totaling million  compared to no such sales in the decreased gains on property sales were partially offset as the result of consolidating two retail joint ventures in april  for which our share of net loss was million in the remaining decrease in equity in earnings is primarily due to a decrease in operating income within certain of our joint ventures due to decreased occupancy in the underlying rental properties 
gain on sale of properties gains on sales of properties decreased from million in to million in we sold properties in compared to nine properties in the properties sold in were part of our build for sale program  which is no longer a significant part of our service operations 
because the properties sold in and either had insignificant operations prior to sale or because we maintained varying forms of continuing involvement after sale  they are not classified within discontinued operations 
earnings from sales of land earnings from sales of land decreased from million in to  in the decrease in earnings was the result of the current state of the real estate market  as fewer developers are willing to make speculative purchases of land for future development 
impairment charges impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets 
the increase from million in to million in is primarily due to a refinement of our business strategy coupled with decreases in real estate values and is comprised of the following activity a result of the refinement of our business strategy was the decision to dispose of approximately  acres of land  which had a total cost basis of million  rather than holding it for future development 
our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis  which resulted in a determination that a significant portion of the land was impaired 
we recognized impairment charges on land of million in  primarily as the result of writing down to fair value the land that was identified for disposition and determined to be impaired 

table of contents additionally  an impairment charge of million was recognized in for office  industrial and retail buildings 
one of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the  impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations 
an impairment analysis of certain of our buildings was triggered either as the result of changes in management s strategy  resulting in certain buildings being identified as non strategic  or changes in market conditions 
we have an investment in an unconsolidated entity the peachtree joint venture whose sole activity is the development and operation of the office component of a multi use office and residential high rise building located in the buckhead sub market of atlanta 
we recognized an impairment charge in to write off our million investment in the peachtree joint venture as the result of the other than temporary decline in value 
as a result of the joint venture s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement  the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share of the additional equity to fund the joint venture s future capital costs  and ultimately from our contingent obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture s loan  we recorded an additional liability of million for our probable future obligation to the lender 
in  we recognized a million charge on our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture the park creek joint venture 
we recognized million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets in compared to million of charges in the impairment charges in related primarily to reserving loans receivable from other real estate entities  as well as writing off previously deferred development costs 
impairment charges recognized on other real estate related assets during were the result of writing off previously deferred development costs 
in  as the result of a re assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings  we recognized non cash impairment charges on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land totaling million 
additionally  as the result of the economy s negative effect on real estate selling prices  we recognized million of impairment charges on two of our build for sale properties that were under construction at december   as they were expected to sell in one of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the million impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component includes general corporate expenses and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to the development or operations of our owned properties and service operations 
those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a million increase in severance pay 
other than this expense item  we reduced our total overhead costs by million to compensate for the reduction in the volume of leasing and construction activity 
however  the absorption of actual overhead costs by an allocation to leasing  construction and other areas decreased by million  which  when netted with the million reduction in costs  resulted in the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a million decrease in capitalization of interest costs  due to properties previously undergoing significant development activities being placed in service or otherwise not meeting the criteria for the capitalization of interest 
additionally  as the result of the conditions in the credit markets driving up interest rates on new borrowings in  the weighted average interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings increased from at december  to at december  gain on debt transactions during  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in through the majority of our debt repurchases during were of our exchangeable senior notes exchangeable notes 
in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million  recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of approximately million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
partially offsetting these gains  we recognized million of expense in for the write off of fees paid for a pending secured financing that we cancelled in the third quarter of income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively  in and we recorded a net valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets during the valuation allowance was recorded as the result of changes to our projections for future taxable income within our taxable reit subsidiary 
the decreased projection of taxable income was the result of a revision in strategy  whereby we determined that we would indefinitely discontinue the development of build for sale properties  necessitating the revision of our taxable income projections 
notwithstanding the valuation allowance recorded during  our taxable reit subsidiary recognized significantly higher taxable losses in than in as the result of the timing and profitability of land and building sales 
discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense and depreciation expense  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
the operations of buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations 
these properties consist of industrial and office properties 
as a result  we classified income loss  before gain on sales  of  million and million in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  five were sold during  eight properties were sold during and properties were sold during the gains on disposal of these properties of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations also includes impairment charges of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  recognized on properties that were subsequently sold 

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue overall  rental revenue from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired five new properties and placed developments in service 
these acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of million and million  respectively 
acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in we sold eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in  resulting in an million reduction in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in of these properties  seven were sold in the second quarter of and one was sold in the fourth quarter of rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees decreased from million in to million in rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total 
table of contents of the overall million increase in rental expenses in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  this increase was partially offset by a reduction in rental expenses of million resulting from the sale of eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in increases in utility costs and snow removal in our existing base of properties also contributed to the overall increase in rental expenses 
of the overall million increase in real estate taxes in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  the remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in tax rates and assessed values on our existing properties 
service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment excluding build for sale properties for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total the decrease in earnings from service operations was primarily due to general contractor expenses being higher than usual in as a result of increases in our total cost estimates for two third party fixed price construction contracts  which reduced the margins on the contracts 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in due to increases in our real estate asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during and as well as the result of recording additional depreciation expense in the amount of million for properties removed from held for sale classification in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in largely as the result of our million share of additional depreciation expense recognized when two properties owned by unconsolidated retail joint ventures were removed from held for sale classification 
the additional depreciation expense was partially offset by an increase in gain on building sales in compared to during  our joint ventures sold ten non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recognized through equity in earnings totaling million  compared to five joint venture building sales in  with million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of the net gains 
gain on sale of properties gains on sales of properties increased from million in to million in we sold properties in compared to properties in the properties sold in and were part of our build for sale program  which is no longer a significant part of our service operations 
earnings from sales of land earnings from sales of land decreased from million in to million in the decrease in earnings was the result of several significant and high margin land sales during compared to decreased activity in as the result of the downturn in the real estate market and in the overall economy 

table of contents impairment charges impairment charges consisted of impairment charges recognized on our long lived assets as well as the write off of previously capitalized costs of potential projects that we determined are no longer likely to be pursued 
the increase from million in to million in was largely the result of a re assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings  as well as the negative effect of the overall economy on real estate values in certain of our markets 
we recognized non cash impairment charges in on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land totaling million 
additionally  as the result of the economy s negative effect on real estate selling prices  we recognized million of impairment charges on two of our properties that were under construction at december   as they were expected to sell in one of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations upon sale and the million impairment charge related to this property is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations 
the remaining million and million of activity in and  respectively  primarily pertained to costs previously capitalized for potential projects that we later determined would not be pursued 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely driven by a million decrease in overhead costs allocated to leasing and construction activity based on decreased volume in these areas 
offsetting the decreased allocation of general and administrative expenses to operating activities was a million decrease in total overhead costs in as we focused on overhead reduction opportunities 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily the result of interest costs related to development projects that were placed in service in late and where the costs to finance these projects were capitalized during construction 
overall  our weighted average interest rates remained fairly consistent from to  as the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured notes increased from to  while we experienced lower interest rates throughout on our libor based unsecured lines of credit 
income taxes we recognized an income tax expense of million and an income tax benefit of million  respectively  in and our taxable reit subsidiary recognized taxable losses in  compared to taxable income in  as the result of the timing of land and building sales 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity a vie and would require consolidation 
we a evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity at risk  b review the voting rights and decision making authority of the equity investment holders as a group  and whether there are any guaranteed returns  protection against losses  or capping of residual returns within the group and c establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this vie determination 
we would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a vie if we were the primary beneficiary 
beginning january   a new accounting standard will be effective and will change the method by which the primary beneficiary of a vie is determined to a primarily qualitative approach whereby the variable interest holder  if any  that controls a vie s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as vies  we further assess each partner s substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated 

table of contents we have equity interests generally ranging from to in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
to the extent applicable  we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be vie s where we are the primary beneficiary 
for non variable interest entities  we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 

table of contents in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate assets we evaluate our real estate assets  with the exception of those that are classified as held for sale  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such an evaluation is considered necessary  we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset  or asset group  with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of that asset  or asset group 
our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on  among other things  our estimates regarding future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is  therefore  subjective by nature 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
to the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset  or asset group  exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective  especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions 
we primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets 
to the extent that the assumptions used in testing long lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant  the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured 
in addition to determining future cash flows  which make the estimation of a real estate asset s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective  the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective 
to the extent applicable marketplace data is available  we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired 
real estate assets that are classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
acquisition of real estate property and related assets we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
beginning january   we record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest 
additionally  beginning january   contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period 

table of contents the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all significant prospective tenants before leases are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
to the extent that a fixed price contract is estimated to result in a loss  the loss is recorded immediately 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies  methodology in applying our critical accounting policies  and impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as the result of generating capital in excess of billion through a common equity issuance  secured and unsecured borrowings  and property dispositions  we have repaid the entire balance on drlp s unsecured line of credit and created capacity  through cash and availability on the line  to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow and accessing the public debt and equity markets 
rental operations we believe our primary source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to a number of risks as a result of current economic conditions  including reduced occupancy  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
in  we recognized million of expense related to reserving doubtful receivables  including reserves on straight line rent  compared to million in unsecured debt and equity securities our unsecured lines of credit as of december  are described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date outstanding balance at december  unsecured line of credit drlp  february unsecured line of credit consolidated subsidiary  july  on november   the company and drlp renewed its unsecured line of credit 
under terms of the renewal  the drlp unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of million with an interest rate on borrowings of basis points over the applicable libor rate  and matures in february subject to certain conditions  the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional million  for a total of up to billion 
this line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
this line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to fixed charge coverage and debt to asset value with asset value being defined in the drlp unsecured line of credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit 
in april  we received million of net proceeds from the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the drlp unsecured revolving line of credit as well as for general corporate purposes 

table of contents in august  we issued million of senior unsecured notes in two equal tranches 
the first million of the senior unsecured notes mature in february and bear interest at an effective rate of  while the other million of the senior unsecured notes mature in august and bear interest at an effective rate of 
the net proceeds from the issuance were primarily used to repurchase outstanding unsecured notes  both on the open market and through cash tender offers  maturing through december the indentures and related supplemental indentures governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
we were in compliance with all such covenants  as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit  as of december  at december   we had on file with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of drlp s debt securities including guarantees thereof and the company s common shares  preferred shares  depository shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts and units comprised of one or more of these securities 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity 
sale of real estate assets we pursue opportunities to sell non strategic real estate assets in order to generate additional liquidity 
our ability to dispose of such properties is dependent on the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable 
in light of recent market and economic conditions  including  without limitation  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  and condition of the equity and real estate markets  we may be unable to dispose of such properties quickly  or on favorable terms 
transactions with unconsolidated entities transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity 
from time to time we will sell properties to an unconsolidated entity  while retaining a continuing interest in that entity  and receive proceeds commensurate to the interest that we do not own 
additionally  unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us  and our partners  all or a portion of the proceeds 
we have a equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that may acquire up to million of our newly developed build to suit projects over a three year period from its formation in may properties are sold to the joint venture upon completion  lease commencement and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
we received net sale and financing proceeds of approximately million  during the year ended december   related to the joint venture s acquisition of seven of our properties 
during the year ended december   the joint venture acquired five additional properties from us and we received net sale proceeds  commensurate to our partner s ownership interest  of approximately million 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following accretive property investment  recurring leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt  and other contractual obligations 

table of contents property investment we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  supply and long term growth potential 
our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon our continued access to our longer term sources of liquidity including the issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties 
in light of current economic conditions  management continues to evaluate our investment priorities and is focused on accretive growth 
we have continued to operate at a substantially reduced level of new development activity  as compared to recent years  and are focused on the core operations of our existing base of properties 
recurring expenditures one of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the recurring leasing capital expenditures of our real estate investments 
the following is a summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands recurring tenant improvements recurring leasing costs building improvements totals dividends and distributions we are required to meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  in order to maintain our reit status 
because depreciation and impairments are non cash expenses  cash flow will typically be greater than operating income 
we paid dividends per share of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings  to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status  and additional amounts as determined by our board of directors 
distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
at december  we had six series of preferred shares outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between and and are paid in arrears quarterly 
debt maturities debt outstanding at december  had a face value totaling billion with a weighted average interest rate of maturing at various dates through we had billion of unsecured debt  million outstanding on a consolidated subsidiary s unsecured line of credit and million of secured debt outstanding at december  we made scheduled and unscheduled principal payments of billion on outstanding debt including repurchases of outstanding debt discussed below during the year ended december  the following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at december  in thousands  except percentage data future repayments weighted average interest rate of future repayments year scheduled amortization maturities total thereafter 
table of contents we anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from rental operations and property dispositions  as well as by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions 
repurchases of outstanding debt during  through a cash tender offer as well as open market transactions  we paid million to repurchase outstanding unsecured notes with a face value of million 
we expect to use a portion of the cash we have on hand at december  to repay unsecured notes maturing in guarantee obligations we are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and  in most cases  do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments 
we are  however  subject to a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of the peachtree joint venture 
a contingent liability in the amount of million was established in based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender 
historical cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating  investing and financing activities in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and service operations activities 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows 
in addition  we have historically developed build for sale properties with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion 
as part of a refinement to our strategy  we have ceased new build for sale development activity to focus on completion of existing projects 
highlights of operating cash changes are as follows during the year ended december   we incurred build for sale property development costs of million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of the planned elimination of our build for sale program 
we sold three build for sale properties in compared to in and in  receiving net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
the sales were nearly break even  while the and sales resulted in pre tax gains of million and million  respectively 
net cash flows from third party construction contracts totaled a net outflow of million for the year ended december   compared to a net inflow of million and a net outflow of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was largely driven by million in cash proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land that was completed in conjunction with a significant third party construction project 

table of contents investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity 
development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements 
highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows development expenditures for our held for rental portfolio totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is in line with our planned reduction in new development activity

table of contents in february  march and july  we received cash proceeds of million from three year secured debt financings that are secured by rental properties 
the secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of and matures at various points in in april  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from this offering were contributed to drlp in exchange for additional units in drlp and were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the drlp unsecured revolving line of credit and for other general corporate purposes 
we had no common stock issuances in  but we issued million shares of our common stock in october for net proceeds of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we opportunistically repurchased a portion of all outstanding series of preferred shares in the open market in order to take advantage of the significant discounts at which they were trading 
in total  we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately million for million  which resulted in an approximate million gain on repurchase after considering the charge off of offering costs from those shares 
in march  we settled three forward starting swaps and made a cash payment of million to the counterparties 
in february  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of shares of our series o cumulative redeemable preferred stock  we had no new preferred equity issuances in in october  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at the liquidation amount of million 
credit ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from moody s investors service and standard and poor s ratings group 
our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of bbb and baa by standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
our preferred shares carry ratings of bb and baa from standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
the ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon  among other things  the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in unconsolidated companies we have equity interests generally ranging from to in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
our unconsolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operations and development of industrial  office and medical office real estate properties 
we hold interests both in joint ventures that operate real estate for long term investment and rental income operating joint ventures as well as joint ventures that develop properties with the intent to sell within a relatively short period of time after completion and lease up development joint ventures 
the equity method of accounting see critical accounting policies is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over operating and financial policies 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet 
total assets of our unconsolidated subsidiaries were billion as of both december  and 
table of contents our investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represent approximately and of our total assets as of december  and  respectively

table of contents related party transactions we provide property management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we earned management fees of million  million and million  leasing fees of million  million and million and construction and development fees of million  million and million from these companies 
we recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services  and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we have guaranteed the repayment of million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments 
we will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service 
management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees 
we also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of eight of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
at december   the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately million 
with the exception of the guarantee of the debt of peachtree joint venture  for which we have recorded a contingent liability  management believes that the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees 
in october  we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of million to a joint venture dugan realty llc in which we have a interest and recognized a net gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash at our option  subject to certain timing and other restrictions 
as a result of this put option  we deferred million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a million liability 
we lease certain land positions with terms extending to may  with a total obligation of million 
no payments on these ground leases are material in any individual year 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted a newly effective accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the new standard requires separate accounting for the debt and equity components of certain convertible instruments 
our exchangeable notes issued in november have an exchange rate of common shares per  principal amount of the notes  representing an exchange price of per share of our common stock 
the exchangeable notes were subject to the accounting changes required by the new standard  which required that the value assigned to the debt component equal the estimated fair value of debt with similar contractual cash flows  but without the conversion feature  resulting in the debt being recorded at a discount 
the resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period from its issuance through november  the first optional redemption date  as additional non cash interest expense 

table of contents at december   the exchangeable notes had million of principal outstanding  an unamortized discount of million and a net carrying amount of million 
the carrying amount of the equity component was million at december  subsequent to the implementation of the new standard  interest expense is recognized on the exchangeable notes at an effective rate of 
the increase to interest expense in thousands on the exchangeable notes  which led to a corresponding decrease to net income  for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows interest expense on exchangeable notes  excluding effect of accounting for convertible debt effect of accounting for convertible debt total interest expense on exchangeable notes in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that will be effective on january  this accounting standard is a revision to a previous fasb interpretation and changes how a reporting entity evaluates whether an entity is a vie and which entity is considered the primary beneficiary of a vie and is therefore required to consolidate such vie 
this accounting standard will also require assessments at each reporting period of which party within the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and will require a number of new disclosures related to vie s 
we do not anticipate this new accounting standard to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our two outstanding swaps  that fixed the rates on two of our variable rate loans  were not significant to the financial statements in terms of notional amount or fair value at december  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values in thousands and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate secured debt weighted average interest rate variable rate secured debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate unsecured notes weighted average interest rate unsecured lines of credit rate at december  n a n a n a n a n a as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives  and interest rates 
interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by fluctuations in libor indices as well as changes in our credit rating 

table of contents at december  the redemption value of our unsecured notes was billion and we estimated the fair value of those unsecured notes to be billion  whereas at december  the redemption value of our unsecured notes was billion and our estimate of the fair value was billion 
our unsecured notes are thinly traded and our estimate of the fair value of those notes  when compared to their redemption value  has increased significantly since december  largely as the result of recent comparable trades being completed at significantly lower  or no  discounts
