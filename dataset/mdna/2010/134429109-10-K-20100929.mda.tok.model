significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions trade and consumer promotion programs the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as cooperative advertising programs  feature price discounts  in store display incentives and coupons 
the recognition of the costs for these programs  which are classified as a reduction of revenue  involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
estimates are made based 
table of contents on historical experience and other factors 
actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment  or as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value  which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 
as of august   the carrying value of goodwill was billion 
the company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing  which began in as of the measurement  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 
holding all other assumptions used in the measurement constant  a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and assumed royalty rates 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the asset is reduced to fair value 
as of august   the carrying value of trademarks was million 
holding all other assumptions used in the measurement constant  a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
in  as part of the company s annual review of intangible assets  an impairment charge of million was recognized related to certain european trademarks  primarily in germany and the nordic region  used in the international soup  sauces and beverages segment 
the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands  resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year 
the reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance  economic conditions  market conditions  and cost of capital 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
however  inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company s control  such as capital markets 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
pension and postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care trend rates 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required calculations to determine expense 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate is established as of the company s fiscal year end measurement date 
in establishing the discount rate  the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities  adjusted as appropriate for duration 
in addition  independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit 
table of contents payments of the plans 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance  considering the company s current and projected investment mix 
this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation  long term projected real returns for each asset class  and a premium for active management 
within any given fiscal period  significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets 
the value of plan assets  used in the calculation of pension expense  is determined on a calculated method that recognizes of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method 
gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 
if the net gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 
net periodic pension and postretirement expense was million in  million in  and million in the expense included million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in canada 
the expense included million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the godiva divestiture  which was recorded in discontinued operations 
the expense also included million of special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives 
significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows pension discount rate for benefit obligations expected return on plan assets postretirement discount rate for obligations initial health care trend rate ultimate health care trend rate estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million  a basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately million 
net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately million in primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations and increased amortization of unrecognized losses 
given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans  the company contributed million to a us plan in the company made a voluntary contribution of million in to a us plan 
contributions to international plans were million in  million in  and million in the company contributed million to us plans in the first quarter of additional contributions to us plans are not expected in contributions to non us plans are expected to be approximately million in see also note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses 
income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates  tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions 
income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

table of contents at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted revised accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
upon adoption  the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  and a reduction in retained earnings 
prior to the adoption  tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
as of august   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  was million

level fair value measurements are based on significant inputs  other than level  that are observable for the asset liability through corroboration with observable market data 
the guidance also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques 
the company adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the guidance requires a gross presentation of the activity within the level roll forward  separately presenting information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the roll forward information must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal  as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim reporting periods within those years
