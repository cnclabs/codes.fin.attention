ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing orion marine group  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a leading marine specialty contractor serving the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
we provide a broad range of marine construction and specialty services on  over and under the water along the gulf coast  the atlantic seaboard and the caribbean basin  and we recently expanded into the pacific northwest 
our customers include federal  state and municipal governments  the combination of which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises 
we are headquartered in houston  texas 
recap and outlook despite a difficult and challenging economic environment  our revenues increased in as compared with the mix of contracts in progress and those completed during shifted more toward the public sector  with of revenue generated from federal and state agencies and local municipalities  which includes the us army corps of engineers 
in  pursuant to a shelf registration on form s  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share  and received net proceeds of million 
with a portion of the proceeds  we repaid all of our outstanding debt of approximately million 
we invested in specialized equipment to enhance our lift capabilities and expand our fleet 
our capital expenditures in totaled million 
during the year ended december   our operations provided cash from operations of million and our cash position at december  exceeded million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external sources of capital and we have not utilized the million available to us under our revolving credit facility 
our overall performance generally depends on spending in the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
spending by our customers  both government and private  is impacted by several important trends affecting our industry  including the following port and channel expansion and maintenance  deteriorating condition of intracoastal waterways and bridges  continued demand in the cruise industry  infrastructure spending by the united states navy and coast guard  near shore oil and gas capital expenditures ongoing us coastal wetlands restoration and reclamation  recurring hurricane restoration and repair 

table of contents in january  we acquired texas based tw laquay dredging  llc for million in cash  utilizing proceeds raised in our august public stock offering to fund the acquisition 
the acquisition provided us with additional dredging resources for deep channel dredging capability as well as additional experienced personnel 
through its backlog of approximately million  the acquisition will immediately contribute to revenue 
in february  we expanded our operations and established a base in the pacific northwest through the purchase of several heavy civil marine construction equipment items  including derrick barges  cranes  hammers and ancillary equipment  at a total price of million 
we continue to see good bidding opportunities in our end markets 
sources of bid opportunities available to us include gulf coast and southeast atlantic ports  which are expected to continue with expansion plans  with supplemental funding available from the american recovery and reinvestment act the stimulus package 
bridge maintenance  alterations  and construction  which should be a priority for states  with funding from highway transportation programs and through the stimulus package 
funds available from the civil works budget and stimulus package of the us army corps of engineers 
the continuation of the highway transportation program for highway construction  including bridges over water 
our focus in will be to concentrate on our core business objectives  to manage our business effectively and efficiently  to pursue rational growth strategies while closely monitoring the costs of our operations  and to maintain our strong balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the company s carrying values of its assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
although our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on a fixed price basis 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant cost drivers of materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits differing from those we estimated and could result in losses on projects 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
these costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin when the change order is formally approved by the customer 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the balance sheet 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by the relatively short duration of the contracts we undertake and our management s experience in estimating contract costs 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
long lived assets fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from one to thirty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if write down is appropriate 
if we identify impairment  we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
goodwill we have acquired businesses and assets in purchase transactions that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
in accordance with us gaap  acquired goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset more likely than not may be impaired 
we assess the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of valuations based on market multiples  discounted cash flows  and consideration of our market capitalization 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuations are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation models are past performance  projections and assumptions in current operating plans  and revenue growth rates over the next five years 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
as required by the company s policy  annual impairment tests of goodwill are performed during the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
based on this testing  we determined that goodwill was not impaired as of october   and no events have occurred since that date that would require an interim impairment test 
the discount rate used in testing goodwill for impairment was 
revenue growth was fixed at per year  which we believe is appropriate based on our assessment of current economic and market conditions 
as compared with the impairment test performed in  the discount rate increased by basis points  due to our assessment of economic conditions and risk  while the revenue growth rate remained constant 
this had the effect of reducing the indicated fair value in the test 
management performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair value resulting from the discounted cash flow valuation  by increasing the discount rate basis points and decreasing the perpetual growth rate by basis points 
the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated no impairment in goodwill 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by us gaap 
we evaluate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
the estimation of required valuation allowance includes estimates of future taxable income 
in our assessment of our deferred tax assets at december   we considered that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions asc  which it adopted on january   which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on our consolidated tax return 
we evaluate and record any uncertain tax positions based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
insurance coverage  litigation  claims and contingencies we maintain insurance coverage for our business and operations 
insurance related to property  equipment  automobile  general liability and a portion of workers compensation is provided through traditional policies  subject to a deductible 
a portion of our workers compensation exposure is covered through a mutual association  which is subject to supplemental calls 
the company maintains two levels of excess loss insurance coverage  million in excess of primary coverage and million in excess of the million  which excess loss coverage responds to all of the company s insurance policies other than a portion of its workers compensation coverage and employee health care coverage 
the company s excess loss coverage responds to most of its policies when a primary limit of million has been exhausted  provided that the primary limit for maritime employer s liability is million and the watercraft pollution policy primary limit is million 
we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
losses on these policies up to the deductible amounts are accrued in our consolidated financial statements based on known claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
we derive our accruals from known facts  historical trends and industry averages to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
actual claims may vary from our estimate 
we include any adjustments to such reserves in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which they become known 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of the awards of equity instruments 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computation 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of the option award

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital  investment in capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions 
historically  our sources of liquidity have been cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
our working capital position fluctuates from period to period due to normal increases and decreases in operations activity 
at december   our working capital was million  of which million was related to the balance of the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in august  as compared to working capital of million at december  as of december   we had available cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility of million 
at december   our operations provided cash from operations of million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external sources of capital  and we have not utilized our available borrowing of million under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to meet our future internal liquidity and working capital needs  and maintain our equipment fleet through capital expenditure purchases and major repairs  from funds generated in our operating activities  and from the proceeds received from our common stock offering  for at least the next months 
we believe our cash position  combined with the capacity available under our revolving credit facility  is adequate for our general business requirements 
subsequent to year end  we utilized approximately million of cash to purchase tw laquay dredging  llc twld  and approximately million to purchase marine construction assets in the pacific northwest 
the following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above operating activities 
fluctuations in cash generated by operating activities are generally the result of timing differences related to the nature and volume of contracts in any given year 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal the increase of million  as compared with was due to an increase of million in net income  a reduction in our deferred income taxes of million  and an increase of million in working capital components  as described below

proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in include million received from the sale of a vessel no longer considered integral to our fleet 
financing activities 
in august  we completed a public offering of common stock  receiving proceeds  net of expenses  of approximately million 
with a portion of the proceeds  we repaid the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
in addition  we received proceeds from stock option exercises  including related tax benefits of million 
cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to our borrowing of million under our line of credit to fund the purchase of assets 
in  net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a private placement transaction totaled approximately million  which we used to repay our debt facility 
sources of capital in addition to our cash balances and cash provided by operations  we have a credit facility available to us to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs 
in february  the company borrowed million under its credit facility to fund the purchase of marine construction equipment and related assets 
in august  the company repaid the outstanding balance on the credit facility of million from proceeds received from its common stock offering 
the company currently has the availablity to borrow up to million under an acquisition term loan facility and up to million under a revolving line of credit 
all provisions under the credit facility mature on september  the revolving line of credit is subject to a borrowing base and availability on the revolving line of credit is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of  thus reducing the balance available to the company on the revolving line of credit to approximately million 
the company is subject to a monthly commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit at a current rate of of the unused balance

the company is in negotiations to renew its credit facility prior to the september  expiration 
bonding capacity we are generally required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide additional security to our customers for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization  working capital  past performance and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
at december   we believe our capacity under our current bonding arrangement was in excess of million  of which we had approximately million in surety bonds outstanding 
we believe our strong balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to continue to access our bonding capacity 
effect of inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials  and other items such as fuel 
because the typical duration of a project is between three to nine months we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases to which we are a party  and which arise in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition  or results of operations that is material to investors

the estimates and assumptions are subject to change upon the finalization of valuations  which are contingent upon final appraisals of property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  and other adjustments through january  revisions to the preliminary purchase price allocation could result in significant deviations from the preliminary allocation 
on february   the company purchased several heavy civil marine construction equipment items including derrick barges  cranes  hammers and ancillary equipment from a private company exiting the marine construction business  for a purchase price of approximately million 
the company intends to establish a base to serve the pacific northwest and west coast  through the lease of yard and office space in tacoma  washington 
the company is currently evaluating the fair value of the assets acquired 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update asu which clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
this asu is effective for us in  except for the requirements to provide level activity which will become effective for us in we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are subject to risks related to fluctuation in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates 
commodity price risk we are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices for concrete  steel products and fuel 
although we attempt to secure firm quotes from our suppliers  we generally do not hedge against increases in prices for concrete  steel and fuel 
commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed price nature of many of our contracts  although the short term duration of our projects may allow us to include price increases in the costs of our bids 
interest rate risk at december   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility or line of credit 
our credit facility expires in september our objectives in managing interest rate risk are to lower our overall borrowing costs and limit interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this  we closely monitor changes in interest rates and we utilize cash from operations to reduce our debt position 
an increase of in our interest rate during would have increased our interest expense by approximately
