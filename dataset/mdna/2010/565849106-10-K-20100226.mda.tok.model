part i item business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in as usx holdco  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation 
as a result of a reorganization completed in july  usx holdco  inc became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco  inc and changed its name to usx corporation 
in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph the usx separation  usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation 
before december   marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock usx marathon group common stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business  and usx us steel group common stock steel stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business 
on december   we disposed of our steel business through a tax free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation united states steel to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one for one basis 
in connection with the usx separation  our certificate of incorporation was amended on december   and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date 
on june   we acquired the percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc map previously held by ashland inc ashland 
in addition  we acquired a portion of ashland s valvoline instant oil change business  its maleic anhydride business  its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only us deepwater oil port  and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline 
as a result of the transactions  map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc mpc effective september  on october   we acquired all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc western 
western s primary asset was a percent interest in the outside operated athabasca oil sands project aosp  an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta  canada 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  as such  our results of operations include western s results from october  western s oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining

in addition to the prospects listed above  we held interests in blocks in the gulf of mexico at the end of  including in the deepwater area 
our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in and onshore we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska 
we have operated and outside operated interests in fields and hold a to percent working interest in each 
in  our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged mmcfd 
typically  our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature  trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters 
to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field 
in  we drilled six wells in alaska and plan to drill four to six wells per year during through we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado  located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex 
our plans include drilling approximately wells over the next five years 
we currently have one operated drilling rig running and averaged net sales of mmcfd in we hold  acres over the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota with a working interest of approximately percent 
approximately locations will be drilled over the next four to five years

africa equatorial guinea we own a percent operated working interest in the alba field which is offshore equatorial guinea 
during  net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged mbpd  or percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes  and net natural gas sales averaged mmcfd  or percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales 
net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in included mbpd of primary condensate 
we also own a percent interest in alba plant llc  an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas lpg processing plant 
alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg 
during  a gross mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in included mbpd of secondary condensate and mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc 
as part of our integrated gas segment  we own percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ampco and percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited egholdings  both of which are accounted for as equity method investments 
ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates a liquefied natural gas lng production facility  both located on bioko island 
dry natural gas from the alba field  which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed  is supplied to both of these facilities under long term contracts at fixed prices 
because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea  we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc  ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances 
our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e p segment 
our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below

the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil 
the aosp s mining and extractions assets are located near fort mcmurray  alberta and include the muskeg river mine which began bitumen production in and the jackpine mine which is currently under construction and anticipated to commence bitumen production in the second half of the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project  with royalties payable to the province of alberta 
the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan  northeast of edmonton  alberta 
additional upgrading capacity is being constructed with an anticipated startup in late or early 
table of contents in the second quarter of  the operator of aosp offered three additional leases to the other joint venture partners for the muskeg river mine 
terms of the transaction were as agreed in the original aosp joint venture agreement 
we elected to participate in these leases and our net proved bitumen reserves increased million barrels 
see item business reserves for comprehensive discussion of reserves related to our oil sands mining and conventional exploration and production operations 
as of december   we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately  gross  net acres 
current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open pit mine  extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils 
ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques 
the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles 
the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry 
the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand  clay and bitumen rich froth 
a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids  water and heavy asphaltenes 
the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently 
the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately mile corridor pipeline 
the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products 
blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products 
the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil  heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil 
the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market related prices  and the other products are sold in the marketplace 
net synthetic crude oil sales were mbpd in both and  but were mbpd in daily volumes for represent total volumes since the acquisition date over total days in the period 
prior to our acquisition of western  the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in expansion  which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine  new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine  addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrading facility and development of related infrastructure  is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of  and upgrader operations in late or early when expansion is complete  we will have more than mbpd of production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands 
the timing and scope of potential future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review 
the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of aosp expansion and the timing of production 
factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics  availability of materials and labor  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects 
the aosp expansion could be further affected by commissioning and start up risks associated with prototype equipment and new technology 
reserves in december  the securities and exchange commission sec announced revisions to its regulations on oil and gas reporting 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update which was intended to harmonize the accounting literature with the sec s new regulations
