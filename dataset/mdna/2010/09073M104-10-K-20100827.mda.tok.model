critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 
valuation of available for sale investments the company considers all of its marketable securities available for sale and reports them at fair market value 
fair market values are based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments are excluded from income  but are included  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the company s current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
net unrealized gains on available for sale investments at june  were million 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow moving and obsolete inventory  inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration 
to meet strict customer quality standards  the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies 
new protein and antibody products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met 
in addition  the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale 
the manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies  therefore  has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage 
the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a two year forecast 
the establishment of a two year forecast requires considerable judgment 
protein and antibody quantities in excess of the two year usage forecast are considered impaired and not included in the inventory value 
the value of protein and antibody inventory reserved at june  was million 
valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units 
the company s annual assessment included comparison of the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
a significant change in the company s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
goodwill at june  was million 
valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several start up and early development stage companies  among them chemocentryx  inc ccx  hemerus  nephromics and actgen 
the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the company s share in the equity of the investee and the company s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
in determining which accounting treatment to apply  the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 
the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment 
development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection and or us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products 
if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received  the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 now codified in asc topic  consolidation

these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because the company s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its consolidated statement of earnings due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
the company generally holds its fixed income securities until maturity and  historically  has not recorded any material gains or losses on any sale prior to maturity 
the company operates internationally  and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
approximately of consolidated net sales are made in foreign currencies including in euro  in british pound sterling  in chinese yuan and the remaining in other european currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro  british pound sterling  and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
month end exchange rates between the british pound sterling  euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar  which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods  were as follows year ended june  british pound high low average euro high low average chinese yuan high 


low 


average

foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other non operating expense  net in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss income
