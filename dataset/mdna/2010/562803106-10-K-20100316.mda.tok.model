this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements 
overview the company offers short term secured commercial loans to small businesses 
loans are secured by collateral such as real estate  receivables  and marketable securities and  generally  accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals of the businesses 
the loans are generally for a term of one year 
most of the loans provide for receipt of interest only during the term of the loan and a balloon payment at the end of the term 
for the years ended december  and the total amounts of  and  respectively  have been lent  offset by collections received from borrowers  under the short term commercial loans in the amount of  and  respectively 
loans ranging in size from  to  were concluded at stated interest rates of to  but often at higher effective rates based upon points or other up front fees 
the company uses its own employees  outside lawyers and other independent professionals to verify titles and ownership  to file liens and to consummate the transactions 
outside appraisers are also employed to assist the company s officials in evaluating the worth of collateral 
to date  the company has not experienced any defaults and none of the loans previously made have been non collectable  although no assurances can be given that existing or future loans may not go into default or prove to be non collectable in the future

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb released the authoritative version of its new accounting standards codification asc as the single source for gaap  which replaces all previous gaap accounting standards 
while not intended to change gaap  asc significantly changes the way in which the accounting literature is organized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted asc to reference gaap accounting standards in its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of asc did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management will base the use of estimates on a a preset number of assumptions that consider past experience  b future projections  and c general financial market conditions 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with asc  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
interest income from short term commercial loans is recognized  as earned  over the loan period 
origination fee revenue on short term commercial loans is amortized over the term of the respective note 
the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america

recent technical accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb simultaneously issued new accounting standards for business combinations under asc  business combinations and asc  consolidation variable interest entities 
both standards update united states guidance on accounting for noncontrolling interests  sometimes referred to as minority interests  which interests represent a portion of a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb have been working together to promote international convergence of accounting standards 
prior to promulgation of these new standards there were specific areas in accounting for business acquisitions in which conversion was not achieved 
the objective of both standards is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in business combinations and consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards 
in business combinations it is accomplished by establishing principles and requirements concerning how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as goodwill acquired in the combination or gain from a bargain purchase  and determines information to be disclosed to enable users to evaluate the nature and effects of business combinations 
in consolidated financial statements the standards require identification of ownership interests held in subsidiaries by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled and presented in consolidated financial position within equity rather than mezzanine between liabilities and equity separately from amounts attributed to the parent  with net income attributable to the parent and to the minority interest clearly identified and presented on the face of consolidated statements of income 
the standards also provide guidance in situations where the parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes while the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
the standard also provides guidance on recording a gain or loss based on fair value in situations involving deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
entities must provide sufficient disclosures that distinguish between interests of the parent and that of the noncontrolling interest 
both standards are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  that is january  for entities with calendar years 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the standards shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued three related new accounting standards all of which impact the accounting and disclosure related to certain financial instruments i asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
it also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
ii asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
iii asc and asc interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments amends these asc s required disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements 
all three ascs are required to be adopted for interim periods ending after june  the adoption of these standards had no material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting standards for subsequent events under asc  subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are available to be issued subsequent events 
more specifically  asc sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition in the financial statements  identifies the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date 
asc provides largely the same guidance on subsequent events which previously existed only in auditing literature 
the disclosure is required in financial statements for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through march   which is the day the financial statements were issued 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification and hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles under asc asc establishes the fasb standards accounting codification codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on the company s disclosures of the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued an update to asc this accounting standards update asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value asu amends the provisions in asc related to the fair value measurement of liabilities and clarifies for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
asu is intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities 
asu is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year asu concerns disclosure only 
the company believes that the adoption of asu will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effected  accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a
