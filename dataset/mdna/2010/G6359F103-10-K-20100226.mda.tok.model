item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world  with approximately actively marketed land drilling rigs 
we conduct oil  gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the us lower states  alaska  canada  south america  mexico  the caribbean  the middle east  the far east  russia and africa 
we are also one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the united states and canada 
we actively market approximately rigs for land workover and well servicing work in the united states  primarily in the southwestern and western united states  and approximately rigs for land workover and well servicing work in canada 
nabors is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs  and actively markets platform  jack up and barge rigs in the united states and multiple international markets 
these rigs provide well servicing  workover and drilling services 
we have a ownership interest in a joint venture in saudi arabia  which owns and actively markets rigs in addition to the rigs we lease to the joint venture 
we also offer a wide range of ancillary well site services  including engineering  transportation  construction  maintenance  well logging  directional drilling  rig instrumentation  data collection and other support services in select domestic and international markets 
we provide logistics services for onshore drilling in canada using helicopters and fixed wing aircraft 
we manufacture and lease or sell top drives for a broad range of drilling applications  directional drilling systems  rig instrumentation and data collection equipment  pipeline handling equipment and rig reporting software 
we also invest in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities in the us  canada and international areas through both our wholly owned subsidiaries and our separate joint venture entities 
we hold a ownership interest in our canadian entity and ownership interests in our us and international entities 
each joint venture pursues development and exploration projects with our existing customers and with other operators in a variety of forms  including operated and non operated working interests  joint ventures  farm outs and acquisitions 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  workover and well servicing operations  on land and offshore 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in our oil and gas operating segment 
our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in our other operating segments 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
the primary determinate of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings which are largely driven by natural gas prices in our us lower land drilling and canadian drilling operations  while oil prices are the primary determinate in our alaskan  international  us offshore gulf of mexico  canadian well servicing 
table of contents and us land well servicing operations 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price million cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel beginning in the fourth quarter of  there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused  at least in part  by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets 
weaker demand throughout has resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices 
the price of natural gas reached a low for of per mcf during september and while showing improvement remains depressed  having averaged per mcf during the second half of the significant drop in the price of oil reached a low for of per barrel in february with continuous recovery throughout  averaging per barrel during the second half of these reduced prices for natural gas and oil have led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services 
continued fluctuations in the demand for gas and oil  among other factors including supply  could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results 
operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing a decrease of billion  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss attributable to nabors for the year ended december  totaled million and million 
per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss attributable to nabors for the year ended december  totaled billion and million per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  during and  our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and other impairments 
earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates includes million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and  representing our proportionate share of full cost ceiling test writedowns from our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures which utilize the full cost method of accounting 
during  our joint ventures used a month average price in the ceiling test calculation as required by the revised sec rules whereas during  the ceiling test calculation used the single day  year end commodity price that  at december   was near its low point for that year 
the full cost ceiling test writedowns are included in our oil and gas operating segment results 
during and  our operating results were also negatively impacted as a result of our impairments and other charges of million and million  respectively 
during  impairments and other charges included recognition of other than temporary impairments of million relating to our available for sale securities  and impairments of million to long lived assets that were retired from our us offshore  alaska  canada and international contract drilling segments 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to our wholly owned ramshorn business unit under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for some of our oil and gas related assets during the years ended december  and during  impairments and other charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling million recorded by our canada well servicing and drilling operating segment and nabors blue sky ltd  one of our canadian subsidiaries reported in other 
table of contents operating segments 
we recognized these goodwill and intangible asset impairments to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
we consider these writedowns necessary because of the duration of the industry downturn in canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery 
these impairments and other charges are reflected separately as impairments and other charges in our consolidated statements of income loss for the years ended december  and excluding these charges  our operating results were lower than the previous year results primarily due to the continuing weak environment in our us lower land drilling  us land well servicing  canada and us offshore operations where activity levels and demand for our drilling rigs have decreased substantially in response to uncertainty in the financial markets and commodity price deterioration 
operating results have been further negatively impacted by higher levels of depreciation expense due to our increased capital expenditures in recent years 
our operating results for are expected to approximate levels realized during given our current expectation of the continuation of lower commodity prices during and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates 
we expect the decrease in drilling activity and dayrates to continue to adversely impact our us lower land drilling and our us land well servicing operations for  as compared to  because the number of working rigs and average dayrates have declined 
we expect our international operations to decrease slightly during as a result of lower drilling activity and utilization partially offset by the deployment of new and incremental rigs under long term contracts and the renewal of multi year contracts 
although rig count is expected to be lower overall  the reductions are primarily comprised of lower yielding assets  leaving higher margin contracts in place partially offset by certain contracts rolling over at lower current market rates 
our investments in new and upgraded rigs over the past five years have resulted in long term contracts which we expect will enhance our competitive position when market conditions improve

adjusted income loss derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense from operating revenues and then adding earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates 
such amounts should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under gaap 
however  management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria  including adjusted income loss derived from operating activities  because it believes that these financial measures are an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company

segment results of operations contract drilling our contract drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations drilling  workover and well servicing  on land and offshore 
us lower land drilling 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years operating results decreased from to primarily due to a decline in drilling activity  driven by lower natural gas prices beginning in the fourth quarter of and diminished demand as customers released rigs and delayed drilling projects in response to the significant drop in natural gas prices and the tightening of the credit markets 
operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years 
the increase in operating results from to was due to overall year over year increases in rig activity and increases in average dayrates  driven by higher natural gas prices throughout and most of this increase was only partially offset by higher operating costs and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
us land well servicing 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig hours operating results decreased from to primarily due to lower rig utilization and price erosion  driven by lower customer demand for our services due to relatively lower oil prices caused by the us economic recession and reduced end product demand 
operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years 
operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from to primarily as a result of higher average dayrates year over year  driven by high oil prices during and the majority of 
table of contents as well as market expansion 
higher average dayrates were partially offset by lower rig utilization 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to despite higher revenues due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects and  to a lesser extent  higher operating costs 
us offshore 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the decrease in operating results from to primarily resulted from lower average dayrates and utilization for the supersundowner tm platform rigs  workover jack up rigs  barge drilling and workover rigs  and sundowner platform rigs  partially offset by higher utilization of our mods rigs inclusive of a significant term contract for a mods rig deployed in january the increase in operating results from to primarily resulted from higher average dayrates and increased drilling activity driven by high oil prices during the majority of  especially in the sundowner and super sundowner platform workover and re drilling rigs and the mase platform drilling rigs 
the increase in was partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense relating to new rigs added to the fleet in early alaska 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the increases in operating results from to and from to were primarily due to increases in average dayrates and drilling activity 
although drilling activity levels decreased slightly during  operating results reflect the higher average margins as a result of the addition of some high specification rig work 
drilling activity levels increased in as a result of the deployment and utilization of rigs added to the fleet in late under long term contracts 
the increases during and have been partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense as well as increased labor and repairs and maintenance costs in and as compared to prior years 

table of contents canada 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income loss derived from operating activities rig years drilling rig hours well servicing operating results decreased from to primarily as a result of an overall decrease in drilling and well servicing activity due to lower natural gas prices driving a significant decline of customer demand for drilling and well servicing operations 
our operating results for were further negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty in the canadian drilling market and financial market instability 
the canadian dollar began in a weak position versus the us dollar  during a period of time when drilling and well servicing activity was typically at its seasonal peak  which also had an overall negative impact on operating results 
these decreases in operating results were partially offset by cost reductions in direct costs  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
the decrease in operating results from to resulted from year over year decreases in drilling and well servicing activity and decreases in average dayrates for drilling and well servicing operations as a result of economic uncertainty and alberta s tight labor market which led to a number of projects being delayed 
our operating results were further negatively impacted by proposed changes to the alberta royalty and tax regime causing customers to assess the impact of such changes 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during and throughout the majority of positively impacted operating results  but negatively impacted demand for our services as much of our customers revenue is denominated in us dollars while their costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
additionally  operating results were negatively impacted by increased operating expenses  including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
international 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the decrease in operating results from to resulted primarily from year over year decreases in average dayrates and lower utilization of rigs in mexico  libya  argentina and colombia  driven by weakening customer demand for drilling services stemming from the drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter of which continued throughout operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years 
these decreases were partially offset by higher average dayrates from two jack up rigs deployed in saudi arabia  increases in average dayrates for our new and incremental rigs added and deployed during and a start up floating  drilling  production  storage and offloading vessel off the coast of the republic of the congo 
the increase in operating results from to primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activities  reflecting strong customer demand for drilling services  stemming from 
table of contents sustained higher oil prices throughout operating results during and most of were also positively impacted by an expansion of our rig fleet and continuing renewal of existing multi year contracts at higher average dayrates 
these increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses  including depreciation expense related to capital expenditures for new and refurbished rigs deployed throughout and oil and gas 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income loss derived from operating activities our operating results decreased from to primarily as a result of full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded during by our unconsolidated joint ventures 
during  our us  international and canadian oil and gas joint ventures recorded full cost ceiling test writedowns  of which our proportionate share totaled million 
these writedowns resulted from the application of the full cost method of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties 
the full cost ceiling test limits the carrying value of the capitalized cost of the properties to the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
the full cost ceiling test was evaluated using the month average commodity price as required by the revised sec rules 
operating results further decreased from to due to declines in natural gas prices and production volumes from our ramshorn and joint venture operations 
additionally  operating results for included a million gain recorded on the sale of leasehold interests 
our operating results decreased from to as a result of full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded during by our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures 
during  our us  international and canadian oil and gas joint ventures recorded full cost ceiling test writedowns  of which our proportionate share totaled million 
the full cost ceiling test was determined using the single day  year end price as required by sec rules at the time 
additionally during  our proportionate share of losses from our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures included million of depletion charges from lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells and million of mark to market unrealized losses from derivative instruments representing forward gas sales through swaps and price floor guarantees utilizing puts 
beginning in may our us joint venture began to apply hedge accounting to its forward contracts to minimize the volatility in reported earnings caused by market price fluctuations of the underlying hedged commodities 
these losses were partially offset by income from our production volumes and oil and gas production sales as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices throughout most of and a million gain on the sale of leasehold interests in 
table of contents other operating segments these operations include our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations 
the results of operations for these operating segments are as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities the decreases in operating results from to primarily resulted from i lower demand in the us and canadian drilling markets for rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies  ii decreases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in alaska and iii decreased capital equipment unit volumes and lower service and rental activity as a result of the slowdown in the oil and gas industry 
the increase in operating results from to primarily resulted from year over year increases in third party sales and higher margins on top drives occasioned by the strengthening of the oil drilling market  increased equipment sales  increased market share in canada and increased demand in the us directional drilling market 
results were also improved in due to increases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in alaska 
discontinued operations in  we sold our sea mar business which had previously been included in other operating segments to an unrelated third party 
the assets included offshore supply vessels and some related assets  including rights under a vessel construction contract 
we have not had any continuing involvement subsequent to the sale of this business and have accounted for the sea mar business as discontinued operations in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income loss 
our condensed statement of income from discontinued operations related to the sea mar business for the year ended december  was as follows year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenues income from discontinued operations  net of tax other financial information general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues general and administrative expenses decreased from to primarily as a result of significant decreases in wage related expenses and other cost reduction efforts across all business units  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in stock compensation expense 
during  share based compensation expense included million of compensation expense related to previously granted restricted stock and option awards held by messrs 
isenberg and petrello that was unrecognized as of april  the recognition of this expense resulted from provisions of their respective new employment agreements that 
table of contents effectively eliminated the risk of forfeiture of such awards 
there is no remaining unrecognized expense related to their outstanding restricted stock and option awards 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues increased primarily due to lower revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily as a result of increases in wages and wage related expenses for a majority of our operating segments compared to each prior year  which resulted from an increase in the number of employees required to support higher activity levels 
the increase was also driven by higher compensation expense  primarily resulting from higher bonuses and non cash compensation expenses recorded for restricted stock awards during and depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages depreciation and amortization expense depletion expense depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from to and from to primarily as a result of projects completed in recent years under our expanded capital expenditure program that commenced in early depletion expense 
depletion expense decreased from to and from to primarily as a result of decreased natural gas production volumes during each year 
interest expense year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages interest expense interest expense increased from to as a result of the interest expense related to our january issuance of senior notes due january the increase was partially offset by a reduction to interest expense due to our repurchases of approximately billion par value of senior exchangeable notes during and interest expense increased from to as a result of the additional interest expense related to our february and july issuances of senior notes due february in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
investment income loss year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages investment income loss investment income during was million compared to million during the prior year 
investment income in included net unrealized gains of million from our trading securities and interest and dividend income of million from our cash  other short term and long term investments 
investment income during was million compared to a net investment loss of million during the prior year 
investment income in included net unrealized gains of million from our trading securities and interest and dividend income of million from our short term and long term investments  partially offset by losses of million from our actively managed funds classified as long term investments 

table of contents investment income loss during included a net loss of million from our actively managed funds classified as long term investments inclusive of substantial gains from sales of our marketable equity securities 
this net loss was offset by interest and dividend income of million from our short term investments 
gains losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages gains losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income expense  net the amount of gains losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income expense  net for represents a net loss of million and includes i foreign currency exchange losses of approximately million  ii increases of litigation expenses of million  and iii net losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets of approximately million 
these losses were partially offset by pre tax gains of million recognized on purchases of million par value of our senior exchangeable notes due the amount of gains losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income expense  net for represents a net loss of million and includes i losses on derivative instruments of approximately million  including a million loss on a three month written put option and a million loss on the fair value of our range cap and floor derivative  ii losses on retirements on long lived assets of approximately million  inclusive of involuntary conversion losses on long lived assets of approximately million  net of insurance recoveries  related to damage sustained from hurricanes gustav and ike during  and iii increases of litigation expenses of million 
these losses were partially offset by a million pre tax gain recognized on our purchase of million par value of senior exchangeable notes due the amount of gains losses on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income expense  net for represents a net loss of million and includes i losses on retirements and impairment charges on long lived assets of approximately million and ii increases of litigation expenses of million 
these losses were partially offset by the million gain on the sale of three accommodation jack up rigs in the second quarter of impairments and other charges year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages goodwill impairments impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale impairment of other intangible assets impairment of oil and gas related assets other than temporary impairment on securities total during the years ended december  and  we recognized goodwill impairments of approximately million and million  respectively  related to our canadian operations 
during  we 
table of contents impaired the entire goodwill balance of million of our canada well servicing and drilling operating segment and recorded an impairment of million to nabors blue sky ltd  one of our canadian subsidiaries reported in our other operating segments 
during  we impaired the remaining goodwill balance of million of nabors blue sky ltd 
the impairment charges resulted from of our annual impairment tests on goodwill which compared the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of these business units was determined using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of rigs or aircraft  revenues and earnings from affiliates  as well as direct costs  general and administrative costs  depreciation  applicable income taxes  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the impairment charges were deemed necessary due to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry in canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery in the value of these operations 
this downturn has led to reduced capital spending by some of our customers and has diminished demand for our drilling services and for immediate access to remote drilling sites 
a significantly prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the demand for and prices of our services  which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our estimate of our future operating results
