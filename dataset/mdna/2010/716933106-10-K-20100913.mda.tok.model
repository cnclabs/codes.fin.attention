company overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune mediated diseases 
our mission and goal is to build a viable biopharmaceutical company that designs  develops and commercializes novel therapies intended to improve quality of life  increase duration of life and resolve serious unmet medical healthcare needs  and to identify promising product candidates based on exceptional scientific development expertise  develop our products in a rapid  cost efficient manner and pursue commercialization and or development partners when and where appropriate 
we exist to make a difference for the better and these are important times to do just that 
presently  we have four product candidates in clinical development  a clinical development candidate in late stage preclinical evaluation and several preclinical molecules in lead optimization 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products  or partner collaborations  generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability to successfully complete the development of ou r products  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
bruton s tyrosine kinase btk inhibitor for oncology  pci is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of bruton s tyrosine kinase btk that is being developed by pharmacyclics for the treatment of patients with b cell lymphoma or leukemia b cells are white blood cells and are an important part of our immune system  b cell lymphoma and leukemia are types of blood cancers 
btk plays a prominent role in the development as well as the survival of white blood cells  in particular b cells 
b cell lymphocyte maturation is mediated by b cell receptor bcr signal transduction and btk is part of the bcr signaling pathway 
recent studies indicate that some large b cell lymphomas have proteins that are activated and lie downstream of the bcr and that btk inhibition can induce apoptosis ie cell death in these b cells 
bcr signaling is also thought to promote cancer cell expansion and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  a prevalent blood cancer 
in preclinical models  inhibition of btk by pci led to apoptosis in multiple malignant b cell lines  and inhibited b cell lymphoma progression in vivo 

table of contents a multicenter us phase i trial in b cell lymphoma is currently enrolling patients 
this phase i trial is designed to determine the safety and tolerability of our btk inhibitor pci  and to evaluate effects of btk inhibition using pharmacodynamic assays and tumor response 
we reported interim results of the trial as an oral presentation at the american society for clinical oncology asco annual meeting on june  in chicago  il 
our abstract was selected among the few to be presented in an oral session abstract control number  permanent abstract id  abstract title btk inhibitor pci monotherapy induces objective responses in patients with relapsed aggressive nhl evidence of antitumor activity from a phase i study 
trial results as of august  a total of relapsed refractory and progressing patients with a variety of b cell malignancies were enrolled in dose groups     mg kg day of standard dosing 
weeks on week off 
and mg kg day continuous dosing 
forty one of the enrolled patients had an on treatment tumor assessment after completing two cycles of therapy and are evaluable for efficacy as of august  twenty one of these evaluable patients had a complete or partial response as their best response and eleven patients had stable diseases 
this equates to a response rate of in the evaluable patients in cll  in mantle  in follicular  in marginal and in dlbcl 
on an intent to treat itt basis the overall response rate orr was 
ongoing research continues to expand clinical indications for our btk inhibitor pci beyond blood cancers ie hematologic tumors and to support our ongoing clinical trials in lymphoma and cll 
pci is a potent inhibitor of histamine release also known as degranulation from mast cells and basophils  which are specific immune cells 
largely based on the work of dr 
gerard evan and others at ucsf  mast cells have emerged as an important component of the proinflammatory microenvironment  which is crucial for the physical expansion and maintenance of tumor growth nature medicine  p 

dr 
evan s lab tested our btk inhibitor pci in his mouse pancreatic model 
in the model  pci completely blocked mast cell degranulation which led to tumor regressio n and vascular collapse 
this work was presented at the american association for cancer research aacr annual meeting as an oral presentation on april  with respect to research in lymphoma the nci has made valuable discoveries indicating that many types of lymphoma are driven by chronic active b cell receptor signaling  a process dependent upon btk activity 
these findings  which included experiments with pci  were published in the journal nature davis et al

bruton s tyrosine kinase btk inhibitor  pci is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of bruton s tyrosine kinase that is being developed by pharmacyclics for the treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases 
in our most recent quarter we identified pci as a clinical development candidate 
most recently we have started ind enabling preclinical safety studies 
pharmacyclics is intending to complete the in life phase of these studies by the end of and is planning to file an ind investigational new drug application in the late second quarter of compared to pci  pci was shown to have increased selectivity for btk inhibition  a reduced potential for off target protein b inding  and improved metabolic stability 
pci ameliorated inflammation in collagen induced arthritis models 
therefore we believe that pci has the qualities to become a new oral disease modifying anti rheumatic drug dmard 

table of contents factor viia inhibitor  pci is a potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of coagulation clotting factor viia 
this drug targets factor viia  the active form of factor vii that arises from interaction with the cell surface membrane protein known as tissue factor tf 
in cancer  the factor viia tf complex is found in abundance in pancreatic  gastric  colon and other tumors  and triggers a host of patho physiologic processes that facilitate tumor blood vessel formation angiogenesis  growth and metastases 
the factor viia tf complex is thought to be the cause of the increased propensity of cancer patients to develop thromboses  also known as blood clots 
laboratory studies and animal models indi cate that our inhibitor of factor viia blocks the growth of tumors that express tf 
we have completed a phase i testing of factor viia inhibitor pci in healthy volunteers 
the primary objective of the ascending dose phase i study was to assess the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles ie the relationship between drug level and pharmacological response of factor viia inhibitor pci following a single  subcutaneous injection 
in addition  the safety and tolerability of our factor viia inhibitor was evaluated 
the drug was well tolerated and no adverse event was observed at any dose level 
the international normalized ratio inr of prothrombin time  a simple laboratory test for coagulation  was used to measure pharmacodynamic effect at dose levels of   and mg kg 
a mean peak inr of was achieved wit hout adverse effects at the highest dose level administered 
the target inr range for oral anti coagulants ie coumadin  is between and a multicenter phase i ii study began with factor viia inhibitor pci in the fourth quarter of calendar the study is enrolling patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that are either receiving or are planned to receive gemcitabine therapy 
in the phase i portion of the study  ascending repeated doses of pci were evaluated in patients receiving concomitant gemcitabine therapy 
pci was administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection at dosages ranging from to mg kg 
the phase ii portion of the study has now started and patients are being randomized into two groups to receive either gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine plus pci for both phases of the study  the planned duration of treatment with pci is weeks 
patients with stable disease at the end of weeks have the option to continue pci treatment until disease progression 
the objectives of the study are to a assess the safety of pharmacyclics factor viia inhibitor pci at pharmacologically active dose levels  b to assess potential inhibition of tumor progression and c obtain initial information of the effects on the incidence of thromboembolic events 
histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor  pci is an orally bioavailable histone deacetylase inhibitor that is currently in multiple clinical trials  including a phase i trial in patients with advanced solid tumors  a phase i ii trial in patients with recurrent lymphomas and a phase i ii trial in sarcoma patients in combination with doxorubicin  an anti tumor agent 
histone deacetylases are enzymes in a cell responsible for turning off and on genes 
pci targets histone deacetylase hdac enzymes and inhibits their function 
we have shown that pci impacts the cell by multiple mechanisms including a re expression of tumor suppressors  disruption of dna repair mechanisms  cell cycle inhibition and by generating an increase in reactive oxygen species  all of which may contribute to tumor cell toxicity 
previous clinical trials have demonstrated that our hdac inhibitor pci has favorable systemic elimination properties when dosed orally  and inhibits the target enzymes 
clinical response or control of tumor growth has been recorded in the three single agent clinical trials to date 

table of contents we announced the phase i trial results of our hdac inhibitor pci  tested in heavily pretreated relapsed lymphoma patients those who had a response but the cancer reoccurred and or refractory lymphoma patients those who had an earlier treatment that did not have an effect on the cancer 
the results of this trial were published at the st annual meeting of the american society for hematology in december of in a review of the clinical data at the end of the phase i dose escalation portion of the current lymphoma trial  we have found that pci produced encouraging efficacy results with minimal toxicity when administered as a single agent 
among lymphoma patients evaluated for disease control after the completion of at least treatment cycles  we observed complete response follicular lymphoma  partial responses follicular lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  mantle cell lymphoma and patients with stable disease 
of the follicular lymphoma patients evaluated in this trial  had objective response and one manifested stable disease 
the hdac inhibitor pci has demonstrated a good safety profile in approximately patients treated so far  with the main dose limiting toxicity observed being a rapidly reversible thrombocytopenia a decrease in platelets  which are blood cells necessary for clotting 
this effect is common among hdac inhibitors and is considered a class effect  related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action 
the duration and severity of the thrombocytopenia is being successfully managed using novel dose scheduling strategies that we have developed and tested in the clinic 
in preclinical models  we have identified synergy of the pharmacyclics hdac inhibitor pci with several approved cancer therapeutics  and some of these combinations are being or will be tested in the clinic  including the use of pci with doxorubicin in sarcoma patients sarcoma is a cancer of soft tissues 
this trial is co sponsored by investigators at massachusetts general hospital and dana farber harvard cancer center 
during this trial we will also test the novel biomarker rad that we have developed in collaboration with scientists at stanford university adimoolam et al  proc natl acad sci usa   which may be useful as predictive biomarker in clinical testing by improving patient selection 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with servier pursuant to which pharmacyclics granted to servier an exclusive license for its pan hdac inhibitors  including pci  for territories throughout the world excluding the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  servier acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the pan hdac inhibitor product worldwide except for the united states and will pay a royalty to pharmacyclics on sales outside of the united states 
pharmacyclics will continue to own all rights to develop and commercialize within the united states 
servier is committing resources to the clinical development of pharmacyclics hdac inhibitor pci during our fiscal year we signed a supply agreement and delivered to servi er kg of pci drug substance  to support their phase i and phase ii clinical development program 

table of contents histone deacetylase hdac isoform specific inhibitor program is at the preclinical lead optimization stage 
most recently  a poster presentation describing the lead optimization and preclinical development of our hdac isoform specific inhibitors  including their efficacy in certain cancer subtypes like t cell leukemia and lymphoma and neuroblastoma  as well as their potential utility in autoimmune disease was presented on april  during the st annual meeting of the american association for cancer research aacr  in washington  dc motexafin gadolinium mgd  pci is a radiation and chemotherapy sensitizing agent with a novel mechanism of action 
mgd is designed to accumulate selectively in cancer cells 
once inside cancer cells  mgd in combination with radiation induces apoptosis cell death by disrupting the oxygen dependent pathways in a cell 
mgd is also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging mri and may allow for more precise tumor detection 
the national cancer institute nci is currently sponsoring a phase i ii multi center study in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiform a type of primary brain cancer 
in this study  which completed enrollment in july  mgd is being administered in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide  a chemotherapy for brain cancers 
previous studies in malignant brain cancers have shown that the combination of mgd and temozolomide have no overlapping toxicities when used in combination 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us comm ercial capability  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
ac tual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front collaboration payments  periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities 
our collaborations with multiple elements are evaluated and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value and whether there is verifiable objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undeliver ed items 
the consideration we receive is combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation are not met 
up front payments under agreements which include future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues related to substantive  at risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expend ed 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation cost for employee stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the accounting grant date for employee stock options with performance obligations is the date on which the performance goals have been defined and a mutual understanding of the terms has been reached 
generally options with performance obligations vest over a four year period  with the goals set and agreed upon annually 
share based compensation for non employee stock options is re estimated at each period end through the vesting date 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term for each of our employee options  non employee options and our employee stock purchase plan is calculated for and applied to one group of grants as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among our employee or non employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our options 
options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations 
the compensation committee of the board of directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met 
share based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued two updates relating to revenue recognition 
the first update eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have been delivered 
the update also no longer allows use of the residual method when allocating consideration to deliverables 
instead  arrangement consideration is to be allocated to deliverables using the relative selling price method  applying a selling price hierarchy 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price should be used if it exists 
otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price should be used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  the company s best estimate of selling price should be used 
the second upd ate eliminates tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance when the tangible products contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality 
both updates require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with prospective application for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospective application permitted 
early adoption is permitted 
the same transition method and period of adoption must be used for both updates 
we are in the process of analyzing the impact of these updates 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures asc improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update will require an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie  present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications under this asu are effective over a period of two fiscal years  for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and after december  the updates for the first adoption date under asu did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the adoption of the updates for the second date is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued new guidance on the use of the milestone method of recognizing revenue for research and development arrangements under which consideration to be received by the vendor is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones 
the update provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
additional disclosures describing the consideration arrangement and the entity s accounting policy for recognition of such milestone payments are also required 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within such fiscal years  beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the guidance may be applied prospectively to milestones achieved during the period of adoption or retrospectively for all prior periods 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
results of operations revenues the following table summarizes our revenue over the last three fiscal years license and milestone revenues we recorded  in revenue in the year ended june  associated with our collaboration and license agreement with servier which was entered into in april given that the deliverables under the collaboration agreement with servier do not meet criteria in the accounting rules for separation eg  no separately identifiable fair value  the arrangement is being treated as a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we recognize the combined unit of accounting over the estimated period required to complete the research activities two years  which coincides with the delivery period for all substantive obligations or deliverables associated with this agreement 
the collaboration and license agreement required us to enter into an agreement to supply drug product for servier s use in clinical trials 
as the supply agreement is considered part of the arrangement we deferred recognition of all revenue under the servier collaboration agreement until the supply agreement was completed and executed 
we completed the drug supply agreement with servier in the second quarter ended december  and therefore began recognizing revenue from the servier collaboration agreement in fiscal of the amount recognized in fiscal   represents the pro rata portion of revenue attributable to the period from april ie  the signing of the collaboration agreement to june   had the supply agreeme nt been completed in april 
table of contents of the total research and development collaboration revenues for the year ended june    represents the amortization of the  upfront payment from servier received in april the remaining revenue of  represents the pro rata completion of services attributable to payments of  from servier associated with research payments  our supply commitment and reimbursements of patent expenses received since establishing the collaboration 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our research and development r d expenses over the last three fiscal years change change r d expenses the increase of or  in research and development expenses for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june   was primarily due to a  increase in stock compensation charges associated with increased non employee option grants and expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan and increases of  in drug manufacturing costs associated with our hdac  btk and factor viia programs   in outside clinical trial costs   in outside contracts and research   in outside services and consulting expenses and  in outside preclinical costs 
these increases were partially offset by a  expense incurred in the prior year associated with the amendment of our agreement with celera corporation 
r d expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in personnel costs due to lower headcount and a decrease of  in drug manufacturing costs and a decrease of  in outside preclinical costs associated with our hdac  btk and factor viia programs  partially offset by an increase of  in expense associated with the amendment of our agreement with celera corporation and an increase of  in outside clinical trial costs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product  the direct costs attributable to each product and total indirect costs for each respective period 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see the risk factors discussed in this annual report 

table of contents prior to fiscal  we did not track our research and development expenses by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis

indirect costs decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease of  in personnel costs  a decrease of  in facility and related costs and a decrease of  in share based compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our general and administrative g a expenses over the last three fiscal years 
change change general and administrative expenses the decrease of or  in general and administrative expenses for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june   was primarily due to a non cash decrease in share based compensation of  and a  decrease in other payroll related costs that were primarily due to the absence of significant severance costs in these decreases were partially offset by a fiscal increase of  in financial advisory expenses and  related to the provision of certain legal and patent outside services 
g a expenses in fiscal increased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to share based compensation expense of  and  of severance expenses associated with separation agreements entered into with our former ceo and cfo in september  partially offset by lower personnel costs of  due to lower headcount and a reduction of  in non severance related share based compensation expense 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our interest and other income  net  over the last three fiscal years 
change change interest income interest expense gain loss on sale of investments gain loss on sale of fixed assets interest and other income expense  net the increase of  or in interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june   was primarily due to a decrease of  in interest expense due to settlement of the related party loans  partially offset by a  reduction of interest income due to lower average interest rates 
the decrease of  or in interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended june  compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in interest rates earned on our investments   of non cash interest expense associated with discounting  in related party loans to fair value and  of interest expense based on the stated interest rates of the notes 
income taxes 
in the year ended june   we recorded a  income tax provision as result of withholding taxes on the  upfront licensing payment received from servier 
in the year ended june   we recorded a  income tax receivable related to a tax credit resulting from a december tax treaty revision enacted between france and the united states that eliminates withholding taxes related to licensing agreements and provides that prior withholding taxes may be reclaimed 
at june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in federal and state tax credit carryforwards of  and  respectively  are available to offset future taxable income 
the federal tax credits will begin to expire in state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
we have determined that a cumulative stock ownership change happened and we have estimated that a significant portion of our net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes  as well as some amount of our federal research credits  will not be available for use in future periods due to these limitation rules 
as a result we have revised our deferred tax asset footnote by reducing the amount of previously reported net operating losses and credits for the estimated impairment amounts 
the reduction to the deferred tax assets have no effect on our statement of operations  earnings per share  balance sheet  statement of cash flows or statement of stockholders equity deficit for any period presented 
a full valuation allowance has been established for our deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital have been private and public equity financings and also proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities of  during the year ended june  resulted primarily from our net loss  a decrease in deferred revenue and an increase in prepaid and other assets  partially offset by share based compensation expense and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended june  and resulted primarily from the operating loss partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and non cash share based compensation expense 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended june  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash compensation expense and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash used in investing activities of  in the year ended june  consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities of  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended june  consisted primarily of  in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a rights offering completed in august  net proceeds of  from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering completed in june and approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities of  in the year ended june  consisted of proceeds from notes payable and the sale of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities of  in the year ended june  primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock 
in april  we signed a collaboration and license agreement with servier 
in may  we received an upfront payment from servier of  less applicable withholding taxes of  for a net payment of  the withholding tax paid to the french government will be reclaimed due to a recent revision in the double tax treaty between the us and france  see note 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of unregistered common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately  in december  we borrowed  from an affiliate of robert w 
duggan 
in march  the loan amount was increased to  in august  pursuant to the terms of the loans  we repaid the  loans outstanding at june  through the issuance of shares in the rights offering 

table of contents our future contractual obligations at june  were as follows operating lease commitments less than year years total in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation now celera corporation business 
future milestone payments we could be required to make under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments based on annual sales of drugs commercialized from these programs 
based upon the current status of our product development plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses  as a result of on going and future clinical trials  to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  due to our extensive drug programs we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek partnership collaborations to help fund the development of our product candidates 
we also expect to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt  partnership collaboration or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through partnership collaborations or sale of our securities  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following our ability to establish and the scope of any new collaborations  the progress and success of clinical trials of our product candidates  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing terri tories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by approximately the table below presents the fair value of our marketable securities at june  and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates fiscal year marketable securities weighted average interest rate
