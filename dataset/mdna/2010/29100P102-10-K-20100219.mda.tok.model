key factors and measures we use to evaluate our business the key factors and measures we use to evaluate our business focus on the number of patients we treat and transport and the costs we incur to provide the necessary care and transportation for each of our patients 
we evaluate our revenue net of provisions for contractual payor discounts and provisions for uncompensated care 
medicaid  medicare and certain other payors receive discounts from our standard charges  which we refer to as contractual discounts 
in addition  individuals we treat and transport may be personally responsible for a deductible or co pay under their third party payor coverage  and most of our contracts require us to treat and transport patients who have no insurance or other third party payor coverage 
due to the uncertainty regarding collectability of charges associated with services we provide to these patients  which we refer to as uncompensated care  our net revenue recognition is based on expected cash collections 
our net revenue represents gross billings after provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care have increased historically primarily as a result of increases in gross billing rates without corresponding increases in payor reimbursement 
the table below summarizes our approximate 
table of contents payor mix as a percentage of both net revenue and total transports and patient encounters for the years ended december   and percentage of net revenue percentage of total volume year ended december  year ended december  medicare medicaid commercial insurance and managed care self pay fees and subsidies total in addition to continually monitoring our payor mix  we also analyze the following measures in each of our business segments amr approximately of amr s net revenue for the year ended december  was transport revenue derived from the treatment and transportation of patients  including fixed wing air ambulance services  based on billings to third party payors  healthcare facilities and patients 
the balance of amr s net revenue is derived from direct billings to communities and government agencies for the provision of training  dispatch center and other services 
amr s measures for transport net revenue include transports 
we utilize transport data  including the number and types of transports  to evaluate net revenue and as the basis by which we measure certain costs of the business 
we segregate transports into two main categories ambulance transports including emergency  as well as non emergency  critical care and other interfacility transports and wheelchair transports due to the significant differences in reimbursement and the associated costs of providing ambulance and wheelchair transports 
as a result of these differences  in certain analyses we weight our transport numbers according to category in an effort to better measure net revenue and costs 
net revenue per transport 
net revenue per transport reflects the expected net revenue for each transport based on gross billings less provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
in order to better understand the trends across service lines and in our transport rates  we analyze our net revenue per transport based on weighted transports to reflect the differences in our transportation mix 
the change from period to period in the number of transports is influenced by changes in transports in existing markets from both new and existing facilities we serve for non emergency transports  and the effects of general community conditions for emergency transports 
the general community conditions may include the timing  location and severity of influenza  allergens and other annually recurring viruses  severe weather that affects a region s health status and or infrastructure and community specific demographic changes 
the costs we incur in our amr business segment consist primarily of compensation and benefits for ambulance crews and support personnel  direct and indirect operating costs to provide transportation services  and costs related to accident and insurance claims 
amr s key cost measures include unit hours and cost per unit hour 
our measurement of a unit hour is based on a fully staffed ambulance or wheelchair van for one operating hour 
we use unit hours and cost per unit hour 
table of contents to measure compensation related costs and the efficiency of our deployed resources 
we monitor unit hours and cost per unit hour on a combined basis  as well as on a segregated basis between ambulance and wheelchair transports 
operating costs per transport 
operating costs per transport is comprised of certain direct operating costs  including vehicle operating costs  medical supplies and other transport related costs  but excluding compensation related costs 
monitoring operating costs per transport allows us to better evaluate cost trends and operating practices of our regional and local management teams 
accident and insurance claims 
we monitor the number and magnitude of all accident and insurance claims in order to measure the effectiveness of our risk management programs 
depending on the type of claim workers compensation  auto  general or professional liability  we monitor our performance by utilizing various bases of measurement  such as net revenue  miles driven  number of vehicles operated  compensation dollars  and number of transports 
we have focused our risk mitigation efforts on employee training for proper patient handling techniques  development of clinical and medical equipment protocols  driving safety  implementation of technology to reduce auto incidents and other risk mitigation processes which we believe has resulted in a reduction in the frequency  severity and development of claims 
amr s business requires various investments in long term assets and depreciation expense relates primarily to charges for usage of these assets  including vehicles  computer hardware and software  equipment and other technologies 
amortization expense relates primarily to intangibles recorded for customer relationships 
emcare of emcare s net revenue for the year ended december   approximately was derived from our hospital contracts for emergency department staffing and approximately was derived from hospitalist  anesthesiology  radiology  teleradiology and other hospital management services 
of this revenue  approximately was generated from billings to third party payors and patients for patient encounters and approximately was generated from billings to hospitals and affiliated physician groups for professional services 
emcare s key net revenue measures are patient encounters 
we utilize patient encounters to evaluate net revenue and as the basis by which we measure certain costs of the business 
we segregate patient encounters into four main categories emergency department visits  radiology reads  and anesthesiology and hospitalist encounters due to the significant differences in reimbursement and the associated costs of providing the various services 
as a result of these differences  in certain analyses we weight our patient encounter numbers according to category in an effort to better measure net revenue and costs 
number of contracts 
this reflects the number of contractual relationships we have for outsourced emergency department staffing  hospitalist  radiology  teleradiology  and anesthesiology services and other hospital management services 
we analyze the change in our number of contracts from period to period based on net new contracts  which is the difference between total new contracts and contracts that have terminated 
revenue per patient encounter 
this reflects the expected net revenue for each patient encounter based on gross billings less all estimated provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care 
net revenue per patient encounter also includes net revenue from billings to third party payors and hospitals 

table of contents the change from period to period in the number of patient encounters under our same store contracts is influenced by general community conditions as well as hospital specific elements  many of which are beyond our direct control 
the general community conditions include the timing  location and severity of influenza  allergens and other annually recurring viruses and severe weather that affects a region s health status and or infrastructure 
hospital specific elements include the timing and extent of facility renovations  hospital staffing issues and regulations that affect patient flow through the hospital 
the costs incurred in our emcare business segment consist primarily of compensation and benefits for physicians and other professional providers  professional liability costs  and contract and other support costs 
emcare s key cost measures include provider compensation per patient encounter 
provider compensation per patient encounter includes all compensation and benefit costs for all professional providers  including physicians  physician assistants and nurse practitioners  during each patient encounter 
providers include all full time  part time and independently contracted providers 
analyzing provider compensation per patient encounter enables us to monitor our most significant cost in performing services under our contracts 
professional liability costs 
these costs include provisions for estimated losses for actual claims  and claims likely to be incurred in the period  within our self insurance limits based on our past loss experience  as well as actual direct costs  including investigation and defense costs  claims payments  reinsurance costs and other costs related to provider professional liability 
emcare s business is not as capital intensive as amr s and emcare s depreciation expense relates primarily to charges for usage of computer hardware and software  and other technologies 
amortization expense relates primarily to intangibles recorded for customer relationships 
non gaap measures adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as net income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary  income tax expense  loss on early debt extinguishment  interest and other income  realized gain on investments  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is commonly used by management and investors as a performance measure and liquidity indicator 
adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such gaap measures as net income  cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
since adjusted ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income for our company  and reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to income from operations for our two operating 
table of contents segments and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  using data derived from our financial statements for the periods indicated amounts in thousands year ended december  consolidated combined adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization expense interest income from restricted assets income from operations interest income from restricted assets interest expense realized gain on investments interest and other income loss on debt extinguishment equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary income tax expense net income amr adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization expense interest income from restricted assets income from operations emcare adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization expense interest income from restricted assets income from operations year ended december  adjusted ebitda interest paid change in accounts receivable change in other operating assets liabilities equity based compensation excess tax benefits from stock based compensation other cash flows provided by operating activities factors affecting operating results federal emergency management agency contract in  fema awarded amr with a national contract to provide ambulance  para transit  and rotary and fixed wing air ambulance transportation services to supplement federal and military responses to disasters  acts of terrorism and other public health emergencies 
the contract covered the states along the gulf and atlantic coasts and was expanded by fema to the full contiguous 
table of contents states on october  fema has the option to renew the contract for different zones in the contract at various points during and in august  amr was deployed under this contract to provide patient evacuations and disaster relief efforts in three gulf coast states for hurricanes gustav and ike and recorded approximately million in net revenue during the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue for the fema contract was approximately million associated with amr s deployment for hurricane dean 
there were no material fema deployments during the year ended december  rate changes by government sponsored programs in february  cms issued the final rule that revised medicare policy on the coverage of ambulance transport services  effective april  the final rule was the result of a mandate under the bba to establish a national fee schedule for payment of ambulance transport services that would control increases in expenditures under part b of the medicare program  establish definitions for ambulance transport services that link payments to the type of services furnished  consider appropriate regional and operational differences and consider adjustments to account for inflation  among other provisions 
the final rule provided for a five year phase in of a national fee schedule  beginning april  we estimate that the impact of a national fee schedule promulgated in  as modified by subsequent legislation  resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in  an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million in  and an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million in based upon the current medicare transport mix and barring further legislative action  we expect a potential decrease in amr s net revenue totaling approximately million for although we have been able to substantially mitigate the phased in reductions of the bba through additional fee and subsidy increases  we may not be able to continue to do so 
medicare pays for all emcare physicians services based upon a national fee schedule 
the rate formula may result in significant yearly fluctuations which may be unrelated to changes in the actual cost of providing physician services 
changes in net new contracts our operating results are affected directly by the number of net new contracts we have in a period  reflecting the effects of both new contracts and contract expirations 
we regularly bid for new contracts  frequently in a formal competitive bidding process that often requires written responses to a request for proposal  or rfp  and  in any fiscal period  certain of our contracts will expire 
we may elect not to seek extension or renewal of a contract if we determine that we cannot do so on favorable terms 
with respect to expiring contracts we would like to renew  we may be required to seek renewal through an rfp  and we may not be successful in retaining any such contracts  or retaining them on terms that are as favorable as present terms 
inflation and fuel costs certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  insurance  fuel and equipment repair and maintenance costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
excluding the impact of the hurricane deployment  fuel expense represented  and of amr s operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we have generally been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and successful negotiation of fees and subsidies  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies and fee changes 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations  financial condition and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion is not intended to represent a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
claims liability and professional liability reserves we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims  automobile  professional liability claims and general business liabilities 
reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves are based upon independent actuarial valuations  which are updated quarterly 
reserves other than general liability reserves are discounted at a rate commensurate with the interest rate on monetary assets that essentially are risk free and have a maturity comparable to the underlying liabilities 
the actuarial valuations consider a number of factors  including historical claim payment patterns and changes in case reserves  the assumed rate of increase in healthcare costs and property damage repairs 
historical experience and recent trends in the historical experience are the most significant factors in the determination of these reserves 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these reserves provides a consistent and effective way to measure these subjective accruals 
however  given the magnitude of the claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known  the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive 
accordingly  our recorded reserves could differ from our ultimate costs related to these claims due to changes in our accident reporting  claims payment and settlement practices or claims reserve practices  as well as differences between assumed and future cost increases 
due to the complexity and uncertainty associated with these factors  we do not believe it is practical or meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of any particular assumption in isolation 
during we recorded an increase in our provisions for insurance liabilities of million related to reserves for losses in prior years  and recorded reductions of million and million in and  respectively  related to reserves for prior year losses 
accrued unpaid claims and expenses that are expected to be paid within the next twelve months are classified as current liabilities 
all other accrued unpaid claims and expenses are classified as non current liabilities 
trade and other accounts receivable our internal billing operations have primary responsibility for billing and collecting our accounts receivable 
we utilize various processes and procedures in our collection efforts depending on the payor classification  these efforts include monthly statements  written collection notices and telephonic follow up procedures for certain accounts 
amr and emcare write off amounts not collected through our internal collection efforts to our uncompensated care allowance  and send these receivables to third party collection agencies for further follow up collection efforts 
we record any subsequent collections through third party collection efforts as a recovery 
as we discuss further in our revenue recognition policy below  we determine our allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care based on sophisticated information systems and financial models  including payor reimbursement schedules  historical write off experience and other 
table of contents economic data 
we record our patient related accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care in the period in which we perform services 
we record gross fee for service revenue and related receivables based upon established fee schedule prices 
we reduce our recorded revenue and receivables for estimated discounts to patients covered by contractual insurance arrangements  and reduce these further by our estimate of uncollectible accounts 
due to the complexity and uncertainty associated with these factors  we do not believe it is practical or meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of any particular assumption in isolation 
our provision and allowance for uncompensated care is based primarily on the historical collection and write off activity of our approximately million annual patient encounters 
we extract this data from our billing systems regularly and use it to compare our accounts receivable balances to estimated ultimate collections 
our allowance for uncompensated care is related principally to receivables we record for self pay patients and is not recorded on specific accounts due to the volume of individual patient receivables and the thousands of commercial and managed care contracts 
we also have other receivables related to facility and community subsidies and contractual receivables for providing staffing to communities for special events 
we review these other receivables periodically to determine our expected collections and whether any allowances may be necessary 
we write the balance off after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from medicare  medicaid and private insurance payors that receive discounts from our standard charges  which are referred to as contractual provisions 
additionally  we are also subject to collection risk for services provided to uninsured patients or for the deductible or co pay portion of services for insured patients  which are referred to as uncompensated care 
we record our healthcare services revenue net of estimated provisions for contractual allowances and uncompensated care 
healthcare reimbursement is complex and may involve lengthy delays 
third party payors are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare and may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  were for services provided that were not determined medically necessary  or insufficient supporting information was provided 
in addition  multiple payors with different requirements can be involved with each claim 
management utilizes sophisticated information systems and financial models to estimate the provisions for contractual allowances and uncompensated care 
the estimate for contractual allowances is determined on a payor specific basis and is predominantly based on prior collection experience  adjusted as needed for known changes in reimbursement rates and recent changes in payor mix and patient acuity factors 
the estimate for uncompensated care is based principally on historical collection rates  write off percentages and accounts receivable agings 
these estimates are analyzed continually and updated by management by monitoring reimbursement rate trends from governmental and private insurance payors  recent trends in collections from self pay patients  the ultimate cash collection patterns from all payors  accounts receivable aging trends  operating statistics and ratios  and the overall trends in accounts receivable write offs 
due to the complexity and uncertainty associated with these factors  we do not believe it is practical or meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of any particular assumption in isolation 
management also regularly analyzes the ultimate collectability of accounts receivable after certain stages of the collection cycle using a look back analysis to determine the amount of receivables subsequently collected 
the analysis resulted in revenue adjustments which were less than of net revenue for the years ended december  and  and of net revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents the evaluation of these factors  as well as the interpretation of governmental regulations and private insurance contract provisions  involves complex  subjective judgments 
as a result of the inherent complexity of these calculations  our actual revenues and net income  and our accounts receivable  could vary significantly from the amounts reported 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management concludes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
the respective tax authorities  in the normal course  audit previous tax filings 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these audits or establish a reasonable estimate of possible additional taxes owing  if any 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized and is required to be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if changes in circumstances  such as an adverse change to our business environment  cause us to believe that goodwill may be impaired 
goodwill is allocated at the reporting unit level 
if the fair value of the reporting unit falls below the book value of the reporting unit at an impairment assessment date  an impairment charge would be recorded 
should our business environment or other factors change  our goodwill may become impaired and may result in material charges to our income statement 
definite life intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews when evidence or triggering events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
should such triggering events occur that cause us to review our definite life intangibles  management evaluates the carrying value in relation to the projection of future cash flows of the underlying assets 
if deemed necessary  we would take a charge to earnings for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value 
should factors affecting the value of our definite life intangibles change significantly  such as declining contract retention rates or reduced contractual cash flows  we may need to record an impairment charge in amounts that are significant to our financial statements
