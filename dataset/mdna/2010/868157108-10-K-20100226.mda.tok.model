executive summary we believe we are a leading provider of oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our drilling products and services segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our subsea and well enhancement and marine segments 
in recent years  we have expanded geographically into select domestic land and international market areas 
we also own oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico that provide us additional opportunities for our subsea and well enhancement  decommissioning and platform management services 
during  we renamed two of our segments in order to more accurately describe the markets and customers served by the businesses in each segment 
the content of these segments has not changed 
the financial performance of our various products and services are reported in four operating segments subsea and well enhancement formerly well intervention  drilling products and services formerly rental tools  marine and oil and gas 
overview of our business segments the subsea and well enhancement segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
we offer a wide variety of services used to maintain  enhance and extend oil and gas production from mature wells 
in  approximately of this segment s revenue was derived from work performed in the gulf of mexico market area  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas 
while our income from operations as a percentage of segment revenue tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase our profitability 
the drilling products and services segment is capital intensive with higher operating margins as a result of relatively low operating expenses 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our drilling products and services businesses 
this segment s financial performance primarily is a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from the gulf of mexico market area  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas 
three rental products and their ancillary equipment accommodations  drill pipe and stabilization and other downhole equipment accounted for more than of this segment s revenue in the marine segment is comprised of our rental liftboats 
operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed  and therefore  income from operations as a percentage of revenue can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
our activity levels can be severely impacted by harsh weather  especially during hurricane season 
market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 

table of contents historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information 
excludes canadian rig count 
as indicated by the table above  all major activity drivers declined sharply in the average number of drilling rigs working in the united states which is more weighted toward natural gas drilling than oil drilling declined  while the international rig count which is more weighted toward oil drilling than natural gas drilling declined 
the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil decreased from  while the average price of natural gas at henry hub declined from factors impacting our financial performance the following table compares our revenues generated from major geographic regions for the years ended december  and in thousands 
we attribute revenue to countries based on the location where services are performed or the destination of the sale of products 
revenue change gulf of mexico us domestic land international total the significant downturn in commodity prices  the drilling rig count and overall industry activity reduced pricing and utilization of our products and services in all segments and geographic markets  especially in north america  where our domestic land revenue decreased to million 
in this market  we experienced a decrease in revenue from our drilling products and services segment and a decrease in revenue from our subsea and well enhancement segment 
within individual product service lines  the largest declines in the domestic land market areas were in coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control  rentals of accommodations and rentals and sales of stabilizers and related equipment 
our gulf of mexico revenue declined to million due to the aforementioned industry downturn  reduced revenue on our large scale decommissioning project  and  the march sale of of our interest in spn resources  our oil and gas production subsidiary which contributed million in revenue in our international revenue increased to million due primarily to a project in mexico involving one of our ft 
class liftboats 
international revenue in our subsea and well enhancement segment increased as we started three projects off the coast of angola and experienced increased demand for emergency well control work in west africa 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenue from our drilling products and services segment primarily due to a decrease in drill pipe rentals in the north sea and rentals of stabilization equipment in international markets 

table of contents industry outlook the weak industry conditions that prevailed throughout much of are showing signs of stabilizing 
domestic drilling rig count and oil and natural gas prices have steadily increased towards the end of however  there is still much uncertainty regarding overall demand for oilfield products and services 
as a result  we anticipate utilization for many of our products and services to increase in pricing could increase as the year progresses and will depend on utilization of our assets and continued improvement in industry fundamentals 
while the worst of the domestic and global financial crisis appears to be over  the us economy has yet to show strong enough growth to spur significant increases in industrial demand for hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  which is a major driver of domestic oilfield activity 
low industrial demand coupled with persistently high supplies of domestic natural gas make it difficult to forecast the pace of increases in our activity 
in addition  changes in demand for our products and services tend to lag changes in the drilling rig count 
our response to market conditions has been to reduce headcount in certain geographic markets without impairing our ability to participate in an increase in demand once industry conditions improve  move assets to other geographic markets  consolidate certain facilities and reduce operating costs 
in addition  we continue to pursue new growth initiatives through acquisitions 
in january  we acquired both hallin marine subsea international plc  an international provider of integrated subsea services and engineering solutions  and a interest in the gulf of mexico based bullwinkle platform and related oil and gas assets from shell offshore inc  which provides us an opportunity to use our services to produce the field s remaining oil and gas reserves  plug and abandon the property s wells and decommission the platform once the field reaches the end of its economic life 
the bullwinkle platform will also generate revenue from production handling agreements which will be recorded in our subsea and well enhancement segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  long term construction accounting and self insurance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the fair value of those assets is less than their respective carrying amount 
fair value is measured  in part  by the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels and operating performance 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
assets are grouped by subsidiary or division for the impairment testing  except for liftboats  which are grouped together by leg length 
these groupings represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have long lived assets  such as facilities  utilized by multiple operating divisions that do not have identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing for these long lived assets is based on the consolidated entity 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our estimate of fair value represents our best 
table of contents estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
during the second quarter of  we recorded approximately million of impairment expense in connection with our intangible assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment 
this reduction in value of intangible assets is primarily due to the decline in demand for services in the domestic land markets 
during the fourth quarter of  the domestic land markets remained depressed and our forecast of this market did not suggest a timely recovery sufficient to support our current carrying values 
as such  we recorded approximately million of impairment expense related to our tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the same segment see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
asc requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on carrying value and our estimate of fair value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our business segments using various cash flow and earnings projections discounted at a rate estimated to approximate the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
based on business conditions and market values that existed at december   we concluded that no goodwill impairment loss was required 
even though we recognized a million impairment of long lived assets within the subsea and well enhancement segment during  the estimated future cash flows  used in the fair value calculation of this segment  from our gulf of mexico and international markets more than offset the depressed land markets 
if  among other factors  our market capitalization declines or remains below our stockholders equity  the fair value of our reporting units decline  or the adverse impacts of economic or competitive factors are worse than anticipated  we could conclude in future periods that impairment losses are required in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill and long lived assets 
depending on the severity of the changes in the key factors underlying the valuation of our reporting units  such losses could be significant 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding the customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we contract for marine  subsea and well enhancement and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
the products we rent within our drilling products and services segment are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our contract to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and related well facilities located in the gulf of mexico 
we estimate the percentage complete utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs 
during the fourth quarter of as the project to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and well facilities neared completion  we determined it was necessary to increase the total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item 
long term construction accounting for revenue and profit loss recognition 
a portion of our revenue is derived from long term contracts 
for contracts that meet the criteria under accounting standards codification  construction type and production type contracts  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and profitability for contracts currently in process 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
to the extent that an adjustment in the estimated total contract cost impacts estimated profit of the contract  the cumulative change to revenue and profitability is reflected in the period in which this adjustment in estimate is identified 
the accuracy of the revenue and estimated earnings we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance and contract revenue and costs 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  third party liability insurances  property damage  and group medical 
with our growth  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have actuarial reviews of our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net loss was million  or loss per share 
included in the results for the year ended december  were non cash  pre tax charges of million for the reduction in value of assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment and million for the reduction in value of our remaining equity method investment in beryl oil and gas lp bog 
also included in the results for the year ended december  were losses of million from our share of equity method investments and million of other non cash charges related to spn resources 
for the year ended december   revenue was  million  and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  included a million gain from the sale of businesses 
revenue across all segments was lower in as compared to as a result of the significant downturn in commodity prices  the drilling rig count and overall industry activity 
revenue in our oil and gas segment decreased due the fact that we sold of our interest in spn resources in march spn resources represented substantially all of our operating oil and gas segment 
subsequent to the sale of our interest on march   we account for our remaining interest in spn resources using the equity method

subsea and well enhancement segment formerly well intervention segment revenue for our subsea and well enhancement segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for cost of services increased to of segment revenue in  as compared to of segment revenue in our revenue decreased due to a million decrease in our domestic land business as a result of the significant downturn in commodity prices  the drilling rig count and overall industry activity in north america 
additionally  our revenue from a large scale platform decommissioning project decreased approximately due to the combination of less work being performed coupled with an increase in the estimated total cost of this project 
during the fourth quarter of as we neared completion of this project  we determined it was necessary to increase our total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project 
as the revenue related to this long term contract is recorded on the percentage of completion method utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs  the cumulative effect of changes to estimated total contract costs is recognized in the period in which revisions are identified 
revenue from international markets grew in due to an increase in emergency well control work and the commencement of three projects off the coast of angola 
drilling products and services segment formerly rental tools revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate decrease from cost of services increased to of segment revenue in from in the decrease in drilling products and services revenue is primarily related to a decrease in the rentals of our on site accommodation units and stabilization equipment  specifically in the domestic land market  and rentals of our drill pipe and stabilization equipment in international markets 
drilling products and services revenue in our domestic land markets decreased to approximately million in from additionally  drilling products and services revenue generated from the gulf of mexico and international markets decreased by and  respectively  in from marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue remained constant at in and the fleet s average utilization decreased to approximately in from in the utilization decrease was offset by an increase in the fleet s average dayrate  which increased to approximately  in from  in the increase in average dayrate was primarily due to the addition of two ft 
class vessels in the second quarter of generally  cost of services does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue due to the high fixed costs associated with this segment  thus  a decrease in revenue would typically result in higher cost of service as a percentage of revenue 
however  during  we incurred substantial costs for maintenance to our liftboat fleet 
additionally  we benefited from a decrease in insurance expense in as a result of our favorable loss history and more competitive marine insurance markets 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  our two ft 
class liftboats were removed from service following damage to one of the vessels during hurricane ida 
one vessel is expected to return to service by the second quarter of and the other in the third quarter of additionally  we sold four liftboats from our ft 
class for approximately million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
oil and gas segment in march  we sold of our interest in spn resources for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of this business of approximately million 
spn resources represented substantially all of our oil and gas segment 
subsequent to the sale of our interest on march   we account for our remaining interest in spn resources using the equity method 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation and amortization expense related to our subsea and well enhancement segment increased million  or  in from the same period in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for this segment is primarily attributable to our and capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in the amortization expense as a result of a million reduction in the value of amortizable intangible assets in the second quarter of depreciation and amortization expense related to our drilling products and services segment increased million  or  in from the same period in primarily due to our and capital expenditures 
depreciation expense related to the marine segment in increased approximately million  or  from the increase in depreciation expense for the marine segment is primarily attributable to the delivery of two new vessels  which was partially offset by lower utilization 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in general and administrative expenses related to our subsea and well enhancement and drilling products and services segments decreased million  or  from to the decrease in general and administrative expense within these two segments is primarily related to decreased incentive compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses related to our marine segment increased million primarily due to the expense incurred as a result of the write down of components from one of our ft 
class liftboats in the fourth quarter of reduction in value of assets during the second quarter of  we recorded an expense of approximately million in connection with intangible assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment 
this reduction in value of intangible assets is primarily due to the decline in demand for services in the domestic land markets 
during the fourth quarter of  the domestic land markets remained depressed and our forecast of this market did not suggest a timely recovery sufficient to support our current carrying values 
as such  we recorded an expense of approximately million related to our tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the same segment 
additionally  we recorded a million expense to write off our remaining investment in bog  an equity method investment in which we owned a interest 
in april  bog defaulted under its loan agreements due primarily to the impact of production curtailments from hurricanes gustav and ike in and the decline of natural gas and oil prices 
as a result of continued negative bog operating results  lack of viable interested buyers and unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate the terms and conditions of bog s loan agreements  we wrote off the remaining carrying value of our investment in bog

the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the exchangeable debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
revenue in the subsea and well enhancement segment was higher primarily as a result of an increase in engineering and project management services associated with a large scale platform decommissioning project 
revenue in the drilling products and services segment was higher as a result of increased production related projects and drilling activity worldwide  recent acquisitions and continued expansion of our drilling products and services business 
both revenue and income from operations decreased in our marine segment due to lower utilization and dayrates 
revenue in our oil and gas segment decreased due the fact that we sold of our interest in spn resources in march spn resources represented substantially all of our operating oil and gas segment

subsea and well enhancement segment formerly well intervention revenue for our subsea and well enhancement segment was  million for the year ended december   as compared to million for cost of services remained constant at of segment revenue in and our revenue increased as the result of our performance on a large scale platform decommissioning project 
we also experienced an increase in revenue from a full year of expansion of wireline and snubbing services in continental europe 
additionally  revenue from coiled tubing services increased approximately mainly from additional activity and the addition of new equipment in domestic land market areas 
these increases were offset by a decrease in revenue from the completion of a construction contract for the sale of a derrick barge in june we recognized revenue for this construction contract throughout using the percentage of completion method 
revenue from land and international market areas grew and  respectively  in drilling products and services segment formerly rental tools revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from the same period in cost of services remained constant at of segment revenue in and our largest increases in revenue were generated from our stabilizers and on site accommodations 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of revenue from the sale of a non core rental 
table of contents business in our largest geographic revenue improvements were in the gulf of mexico where revenue increased to approximately million in over the same period in we also experienced significant increases in the south american and african market areas 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in drill pipe rental in the north sea market 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
conversely  cost of services increased for the year ended december   from the same period in  due to lower utilization  increased maintenance and higher direct costs 
the increase in maintenance cost is partially due to the fact that we use periods of lower utilization as an opportunity to perform required maintenance to our liftboat fleet 
additionally  cost of services usually does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue due to the high fixed costs associated with this segment 
the fleet s average utilization decreased to approximately in from in the fleet s average dayrate decreased to approximately  in from  in oil and gas segment in march  we sold of our interest in spn resources for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of this business of approximately million

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in general and administrative expenses related to our subsea and well enhancement and drilling products and services segments increased million  or  from to the increase in general and administrative expense is primarily related to increased expenses associated with our geographic expansion  increased retirement benefits  increased incentive compensation expenses due to our strong operating results and additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at approximately of revenue for and liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in the decrease in cash generated from operating activities is primarily due to the overall decrease in sales and profitability from to our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   million was held in a foreign account in anticipation of the january acquisition of hallin 

table of contents we spent million of cash on capital expenditures during the year ended december  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our drilling products and services equipment inventory  approximately million was spent on our marine segment and approximately million was used to expand and maintain the asset base of our subsea and well enhancement segment 
in april  we contracted to purchase a interest in four ft 
class liftboats 
the first two vessels were placed in service during april and may of in september  we acquired the other interest in the four liftboats for a total price of million  following the other owner s exercise of an option requiring us to purchase its interest in these liftboats 
construction on the two remaining vessels was suspended in march  as a result of disputes with the builder 
those disputes have been resolved and the uncompleted vessels have been delivered to a different shipyard to be completed 
we expect the remaining two vessels to be completed during the second half of in may  we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to million from million 
any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on june  costs incurred during the year ended december  associated with amending the revolving credit facility were approximately million 
these costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
at february   we had approximately million outstanding under the bank credit facility 
additionally  we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
we have million outstanding at december  in us government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad  for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  on june rd and december rd of each year through the maturity date of june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
this marad financing also requires that we comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth  working capital and debt to equity requirements

under certain circumstances  holders may exchange the notes for shares of our common stock 
the initial exchange rate is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this is equal to an initial exchange price of per share 
the exchange price represents a premium over the closing share price at the date of issuance 
the notes may be exchanged under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of the notes for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter

we may exercise the call options we purchased at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise the warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in common stock or in a combination of cash and common stock  at our option 
these transactions may potentially reduce the dilution of our common stock from the exchange of the notes by increasing the effective exchange price to per share 
lehman brothers otc derivatives  inc lbotc is the counterparty to of our call option and warrant transactions 
in october  lbotc filed for bankruptcy protection 
we continue to carefully monitor the developments affecting lbotc 
although we may not be able to retain the benefit of the call option due to lbotc s bankruptcy  we do not expect that there will be a material impact  if any  on the financial statements or results of operations 
the call option and warrant transactions described above do not affect the terms of the outstanding exchangeable notes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for our international operations  other than our operations in the united kingdom and europe  is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and europe are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
when we believe prudent  we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the forward foreign exchange contracts we enter into generally have maturities ranging from one to eighteen months 
we do not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rates at december   million of our long term debt outstanding had variable interest rates 
based on the amount of this debt outstanding at december   a increase in the variable interest rate would increase our interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately  equity price risk we have million of senior exchangeable notes due the notes are  subject to the occurrence of specified conditions  exchangeable for our common stock initially at an exchange price of per share  which would result in an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock being issued upon exchange

the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on december   december  and december  for of the principal amount of notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
each  of principal amount of the notes is initially exchangeable into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to maturity only if the price of our common stock reaches of the applicable exchange rate during certain 
table of contents periods of time specified in the notes  specified corporate transactions occur  the notes have been called for redemption  or the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 
in addition  in the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the notes for of the principal amount 
we also have agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants of our common stock 
we may exercise the call options at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise their warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
lehman brothers otc derivatives  inc lbotc is the counterparty to of our call option and warrant transactions 
in october  lbotc filed for bankruptcy protection 
we continue to carefully monitor the developments affecting lbotc 
although we may not be able to retain the benefit of the call option due to lbotc s bankruptcy  we do not expect that there will be a material impact  if any  on the financial statements or results of operations 
the call option and warrant transactions described above do not affect the terms of the outstanding exchangeable notes
