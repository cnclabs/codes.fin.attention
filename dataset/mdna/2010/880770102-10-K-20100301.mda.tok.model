overview we design  develop  manufacture  and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics  automotive  computing  telecommunications  and aerospace and defense industries 
our automatic test equipment products and services include semiconductor test semiconductor test systems  and military aerospace mil aero test instrumentation and systems  circuit board test and inspection commercial board test systems  automotive diagnostic and test diagnostic solutions systems and hard disk drive test hdd systems  collectively these products represent systems test group 
we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers idms  outsourced sub assembly and test providers osats  wafer foundries  fabless companies that design  but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits ics  manufacturers of circuit boards  automotive companies  hdd manufacturers  aerospace and military contractors as well as the united states department of defense 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy  which has negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry 
the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
in response to the business downturn  we implemented significant permanent and temporary cost reduction measures 
we reduced headcount worldwide  cut capital spending  and imposed temporary salary reductions and furloughs on our workforce 
due to the continued improvement in our business  we removed the temporary salary reductions and furloughs we imposed over the last year 
we believe the permanent cost cutting measures we took in the last several quarters will be of long term value 
in addition  we believe our acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and our entry into the high speed memory and hdd markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth 
we will continue to invest in our business in anticipation of a broader recovery in our markets and to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 
as the fourth quarter of demonstrated  with our current cost structure  we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point  provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification  or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix  and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of asc  stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of asc stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc as required by asc  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of asc was not material 
prior to the adoption of asc  we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb 
on may   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers  and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may   and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately  and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under asc by approximately million in the aggregate  on a pre tax basis  over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of this review  undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  we have maintained our valuation allowance at december  and investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc  investments debt and equity securities 
on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of million and million  in the years ended december  and  primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 
effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and liabilities 
as defined in asc  fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments 
asc requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date 
level inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date 
for example  a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing 
matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices  and therefore is considered a level input 
level unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data 
unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available  which might include teradyne s own data 
as a result of our november  acquisition of eagle test  we acquired million of auction rate securities ars at fair value million par value 
in addition  we acquired the right ubs put to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest  at our sole discretion  during a two year period beginning on june   and received an option to borrow up to of the fair value of the ars at no cost 
beginning in february and continuing through december   the majority of the securities in our acquired ars portfolio have experienced failed auctions  resulting in inability to sell these securities 
consequently  as set forth in the trust indentures  the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate 
a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer 
all of our ars are aaa  aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer 
at december   the underlying securities for the ars have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirty years 
substantially all of these securities are collateralized by student loans 
because the ubs put is expected to allow us to sell our ars securities at par within a relatively short time period and provides ubs with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the ubs put through july  we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer 
we intend to exercise the ubs put and require ubs to repurchase our ars at par at the earliest possible time  june as a result  as of the eagle test acquisition date november   we classified the ars as trading securities under asc during  we recorded a net gain of million in interest income and during we recorded a loss of million  in interest expense and other  in our consolidated statement of operations for the changes in the ars fair value 
in determining the fair value of our ars and other investments  we utilize the provisions of asc in determining the value of our ars as of december  and we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments 
specifically  we used the following key inputs to our valuation model as of december  and term we estimated a four to five year expected life of the instruments  based on our expectations of the most likely time in which it would take for the instruments to be called by the issuer or liquidity to be restored to the market place 
probability of default we determined the probability of default using market credit spreads 
discount rate we determined the discount rate based on estimated yields of similar publicly traded instruments eg  similar collateral  terms  credit quality  etc liquidity risk premium given the recent instability in the financial markets and the low demand for auction rate securities  it is unclear as to when these securities will become liquid again 
without the auction process functioning again  it would be extremely difficult to estimate the expected holding period for these instruments 
as a result  we included a to basis point premium to the discount rate to reflect the illiquidity of these bonds 
based on these key inputs  we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio at million and million as of december  and  respectively 
on november   we recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of million 
at december  and  the fair value of the ubs put was million and million  respectively 
we recorded a million loss in interest expense during for the decrease in the fair value of the ubs put and a million gain in interest income during for an increase in the fair value 
in determining the fair value of the ubs put as of december   we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time  june  we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the ubs put using the following assumptions a time period of years  representing the period from december  to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the ubs put june  and a discount rate of  which included a spread based on the credit default swap of ubs in order to account for the credit risk of ubs 
as of december   the following assumptions were used a time period of years and a discount rate of 
we have elected fair value treatment for the ubs put under asc  financial instruments 
the ubs put is the only instrument of this nature or type that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under asc goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently  when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our long lived assets  we determined that our long lived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups system on a chip high speed memory  nextest  eagle test and assembly test that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we identified developed technology as the primary asset for the nextest and eagle test asset groups  test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the system on a chip high speed memory asset group  and fixed assets as the primary asset for the assembly test asset group 
we tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset group s carrying amount 
the projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our goodwill impairment evaluation  except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and  as a result  the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable 
as a result  no impairment loss was recognized

book to bill ratio book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales 
book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows three months ended december  semiconductor test systems test group total company revenues net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows dollar change dollar change in millions semiconductor test systems test group semiconductor test revenue decreased million or approximately from to  due to excess test capacity at our customers as a result of the global economic downturn 
the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of added million of revenue in compared to million in semiconductor test revenue increased million or approximately from to  primarily due to million of sales from our nextest acquisition partially offset by lower sales due to decreased demand related to soc device units growing at a lower rate in compared to the increase in systems test group revenue of million or approximately from to was primarily due to sales of hard disk drive test systems  partially offset by a decrease in commercial board test and diagnostic solutions sales  while mil aero product and service sales remained flat 
systems test group revenue decreased million or approximately from to  primarily due to a lower mil aero board test program related sales 
our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years semiconductor test systems test group net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows united states taiwan malaysia south east asia europe thailand singapore japan korea rest of the world the breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows dollar change dollar change in millions product revenue service revenue our product revenue decreased million or in from due to lower sales across all semiconductor test  commercial board test and diagnostic solutions products as a result of excess test capacity at our customers due to the global economic downturn 
the decrease was partially offset by sales of hard disk drive test systems 
the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of added million of product revenue in service revenue  which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales  and applications support  decreased million or due to the global economic downturn 
our product revenue decreased million or in from due to decreased demand 
service revenue increased million or due to a larger installed base 
in  revenues from one customer accounted for approximately of total revenue 
in and  no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated net revenue 
in   and  our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for   and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross profit dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions gross profit percent of total revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to by percentage points 
this decrease in gross profit was the result of a decrease of points due to lower product sales volume  a decrease of points related to higher product revenue as a percentage of total revenue  which included the growth of hard disk drive test system revenues  and a decrease of points for a charge to adjust eagle test acquired inventory to fair value 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of points primarily from lower operations spending due to workforce reductions and lower freight and warranty charges  which were the result of lower product sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to by percentage points 
a decrease of points was due to a million increase in provision for excess inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition  this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our semiconductor test group 
the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions product gross profit percent of product revenue service gross profit percent of service revenue we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an inventory provision of million included in cost of revenues  due to the following factors downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor and automotive industries primarily in the first half of resulted in an inventory provision of million for inventory not expected to be consumed  a decline in demand versus forecast for our liquid crystal display lcd test product due to the global economic downturn  lower product pricing by competitors  the introduction of a new product by a competitor and consolidation among a number of the expected buyers of the product  resulted in an inventory provision of million  and during late  we introduced the next versions of our nextest magnum memory test product 
at that time  it was anticipated that demand would continue for the existing version of the product within its installed base of customers 
an overall decline in the memory market combined with a portion of our customers accelerating their purchasing of the newer version of the product resulted in an inventory provision of million 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in  million was related to semiconductor test and million was related to systems test group 
during the year ended december   we recorded an inventory provision of million included in cost of revenues  due to the following factors in the third quarter of  we recorded an inventory provision of million related to wireless instrumentation associated with our semiconductor test segment s flex test platform 
in the first half of  there had been a significant increase in demand for our wireless instrumentation 
in the third quarter of  this wireless instrumentation demand decreased abruptly causing a reduction in forecasted demand 
this significant decrease in demand combined with an upcoming wireless instrumentation product transition resulted in an inventory write down of million  and the remainder of the charge of million primarily reflects downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor test industry at the end of of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in  million was related to semiconductor test and million was related to systems test group 
the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test and million related to systems test group 
during the year ended december   and  we scrapped million  million and million of inventory  respectively  and sold million  million and million of previously written down or written off inventory  respectively 
as of december   we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written down or written off totaling million 
we have no pre determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 
engineering and development engineering and development expenses were as follows change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue the decrease of million in engineering and development expenses from to was mainly due to a million decrease in spending as a result of workforce reductions and lower project spending and a million decrease due to temporary salary reductions 
this decrease was partially offset by additional costs of million related to the acquisition of eagle test 
the increase of million in engineering and development expenses from to was mainly due to an increase of million in spending related to investments in adjacent markets  an increase of million due to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test  partially offset by a decrease in other semiconductor test spending primarily related to headcount reduction of million and lower variable employee compensation of million 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses were as follows change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the decrease in selling and administrative spending of million from to is due primarily to a million decrease from workforce reductions and on going cost reduction initiatives and a million decrease due to temporary salary reductions  partially offset by additional costs of million related to the acquisition of eagle test 
the decrease in selling and administrative spending of million from to consists primarily of the following million decrease due to lower labor costs from reductions in headcount  million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation  partially offset by million increase due to the acquisition of nextest and million increase related to the acquisition of eagle test 
acquired intangible assets amortization acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows change change dollars in millions acquired intangible assets amortization percent of total revenue acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from to due to the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from to due to the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test 
goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
we experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of this sharp decline led to a non cash impairment of our goodwill of million as of december  in process research and development in  we recorded an expense of million related to in process research and development related to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test 
on march   we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for million  which includes million in fees directly related to the acquisition 
of the purchase price  million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations 
the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 
in the year ended december   as a result of a workforce reduction  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the acquired workforce asset 
restructuring and other restructuring in response to a downturn in the industry  we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs  principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of the remaining accrual for lease payments of million on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account  and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in we expect to pay approximately million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months 
our future lease commitments  as of december   are net of expected sublease income of million 
as of december   we have subleased approximately of our unoccupied space 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million related to activities  as part of ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure in light of the industry wide decline in orders for semiconductor equipment  and a credit of million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to q activity 
the restructuring charges credit recorded in consisted of the following activities q activity million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately people  of which million and people were in semiconductor test  million and people were in systems test group  and million and people were in corporate

the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year 
the first interest payment was on september  the notes will mature on march   unless earlier repurchased by us or converted 
the notes may be converted  under certain circumstances and during certain periods  at an initial conversion rate of approximately shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately per share of our common stock  representing a conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march  we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity

this could result in a material effect on our liquidity position 
we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans we adopted the funded status recognition provision of asc  compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans effective december  asc requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries  and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million  including a settlement charge of million and a curtailment gain of million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations 
discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis 
we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover periodically  and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust the rate as necessary 
the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities  invested in fixed income securities  and invested in other securities 
our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us qualified pension plan  we had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the plan s expected cash flows and was at december   down from at december  we estimate that in we will recognize approximately million of pension expense for the us qualified pension plan 
the pension expense estimate for is based on a discount rate  and return on plan assets 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 
as of december   we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of million  of which million is for the us qualified pension plan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the potential change in our us qualified pension plan expense for the year ending december   that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
during  we made a discretionary contribution of million to the us qualified pension plan  million contribution to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and million contribution to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries 
on february   we made a discretionary contribution of million to the us qualified pension plan and we expect to contribute approximately million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in contributions that will be made in to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies 
all of our auction rate marketable securities are aaa  aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer 
our fixed income available for sale marketable securities purchased during and held as of december  have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro  british pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in short term and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december  and million as of december
