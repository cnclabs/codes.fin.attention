rjr tobacco rjr tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive us cigarette market  which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since and is expected to continue to decline

the support brands include four premium brands  winston  kool  salem and capri  and two value brands  doral and misty  all of which receive limited marketing support 
the non support brands  consisting of all other brands  are managed to maximize near term profitability 
the key objectives of the portfolio strategy are to ensure the long term market share growth of the growth brands while managing the support brands for long term sustainability and profitability 
at present  rjr tobacco s smoke free products are marketed under the camel brand and focus on long term growth 
competition is based primarily on brand positioning  including price  product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing  substantial marketing support  retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style

the moist snuff category has developed many of the characteristics of the larger  cigarette market  including multiple pricing tiers with intense competition  focused marketing programs and significant product innovation 
in contrast to the declining us cigarette market  us moist snuff volumes grew over in  driven by the accelerated growth of price value brands 
profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products 
moist snuff s growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both 
within the moist snuff category  premium brands have lost market share to price value brands  led by the growth of grizzly  in recent years 
however  during  heavy promotion and competitive pricing of premium brands have slowed the growth of the price value brands 
conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories 
similar to the cigarette market  competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price  as well as product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence
