please also refer to the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of some of the principal risks and uncertainties inherent in our businesses 
executive overview our net loss of million was reported in compared to net income of million in the decrease in earnings from to was primarily due to an increase in provision expense of million compared to  an increase of  in fdic premiums including a one time industry wide special assessment compared to prior year  and an increase in total expenses and valuation adjustments on other real estate owned of million 
the increase in expenses and valuation adjustments on other real estate owned includes write downs totaling million on three other real estate owned properties 
net interest income decreased from to  along with a decrease in net interest margin from to 
net interest income decreased due to a decrease in net interest margin  a purposeful decrease in total loans which reduces overall earning assets  and the continuance of elevated levels of nonperforming assets 
net interest margin decreased in primarily due to short term interest rates taking a basis point plunge from a fed funds rate of to a low of in december where it remained for the entire year of non interest income decreased by  from to primarily due to an other than temporary impairment otti charge on two securities totaling  and a decrease of  in trust and brokerage fee income being offset with an increase of  or  in loan brokerage fees and an increase of  or  in gain on sale of available for sale securities 
operating expenses increased by million  or  from to the increase was due to two main expenses  which were write downs on other real estate owned and fdic insurance premiums 
the write downs on other real estate owned increased by million from to there were three write downs over the year with one residential development property making up  of the total expense recorded due to receiving a new appraisal 
there was an increase of  in fdic insurance premiums including a one time industry wide special assessment due to the need to replenish the fund that was depleted by numerous financial institutions failing in and the fdic also saw a need to increase the premiums due to the expectation of future bank failures  the c ontinuation of the increased insured limit of  on interest bearing deposits and unlimited for non interest bearing deposits  and the additional operating expenses that have and will be incurred with the increased resolution activity 
legal and professional expenses increased through a consulting engagement incurred to analyze our lending staffing and processes 
the engagement included analyzing current staffing levels and our internal approval processes for commercial and consumer loans 
the engagement resulted in the creation of a centralized underwriting function for consumer loans and making necessary staffing adjustments in the areas of credit and lending 
these expenses also increased due to additional costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
the increases in operating expenses were offset by a decrease in employment expenses by  our decrease in employment expenses would have been greater without the c ontractual obligations imposed from the early retirement of our chariman of the board  donald f 
schenkel 
the early retirement created additional expenses totaling approximately  as a result of the discounted payment of his contractual salary and the acceleration of the accrual of the supplemental executive retirement plan serp as determined by the contract 
total assets decreased by million  or  from the prior year 
the purposeful decrease in net loans of million partially offset by an increase in total securities by million and federal reserve bank stock by  was the primary reason for the decrease in total assets 
asset quality and liquidity continues to be a major focus of the bank  as we worked to turn our non performing assets into income producing assets 
non performing assets increased by  from to  but they have decreased by million from a high of million at september  although nonperforming assets slightly increased  nonperforming loans decreased by million from december  to december  and the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to at decemb er  from at december  core deposits grew million and now comprise of total deposits  compared to in the prior year 
this growth in core deposits allowed us to reduce our higher rate certificate of deposits and debt causing a decrease in our cost of funds 
despite the decrease in cost of funds in  net interest margin continued to decrease due to short term interest rates remaining unchanged from the low set in december with the decline in rates in  the quarterly net interest margin dropped to at march  and steadily rose to   and at june   september   and december   respectively 
the net interest margin year to date at december  grew to due to the implementation of an interest rate floor on loans and the migration of the balance sheet by increasing our investment securities and reducing our outstanding loans 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies ar e defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the l oan portfolio and general economic conditions 
absent the availability of some of these factors  we base our estimates upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary 
we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects a decrease of million from net income of million in and a decrease of million from a net loss of million posted in a net loss per diluted share of reflects a decrease from the net income reported in and a decrease from the net loss posted in the results reflected a million decline from net income of million reported in net interest income decreased by million  or  due to a drop in interest margin from the prior year  elevated levels of non performing assets  and a purposeful decrease in total loans which decreased earning assets 
net interest margin decreased due to a prolonged period of short term interest rates from the final decline in december noninterest income remained unchanged primarily due to recording charges for other than temporary impairment of two investment securities in the amount of  and a decrease of  in trust and brokerage fees 
these decreases were offset by an increase of  in loan brokerage fees 
provision expense increased in by million compared to to replenish the allowance for loans losses after net charge offs of million 
noninterest expense increased by million due to an increase of  in fdic premiums including a one time industry wide special assessment and an increase of million in cost and valuation expenses on other real estate owned 
the increase in costs and valuation expenses on other real estate owned includes write downs totaling million on three other real estate owned properties 
the increases in noninterest expense were offset by a decrease in employment expenses by  in spite of additional expenses incurred due to the retirement of the chairman of the board of directors 
net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  resulting in million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million and million  respectively  providing for net interest income of million 
the decrease of million in net interest income in from was d ue to a decrease in net interest margin  elevated levels of non performing assets  and a purposeful decrease in total loans 
we decided to lower our total loans outstanding to focus on improving asset quality and increasing liquidity through the purchase of investments 
nonperforming assets increased slightly by  from december  to december   but they have decreased by million from a high of million at september  although nonperforming assets slightly increased  nonperforming loans decreased by million from december  to december  the decrease in nonperforming loans and the purposeful decrease in total loans reflect the company s focus on improving asset quality  improving profitability  and recognizing the challenging economic environment 
the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the decrease in net yield during was due to unchanged short term interest rates after a basis point drop from january  to december   specifically the fed funds rate  which remained at to through the entire year of the decrease in short term interest rates had a directly impacted the net interest margin by causing it to decrease to quarter to date as of march  through the implementation of an interest rate floor on loans and the strategic repricing of deposits and borrowings during  the quarterly net interest margin increased to   and at june   september   and december   respectively 
deposit costs decreased as a result of a shift of certificate of deposits greater than  to lower cost core deposits  such as non interest bearing  interest bearing checking accounts  and money market accounts which increased by million  million  and million  respectively  since december  health savings accounts were the primary increase in interest bearing checking as they increased by million throughout the year 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

average loans comprised  and of average earning assets during  and  respectively 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of  and earned million  or of total interest income  a decrease of million from the decrease in net interest income was mainly due to the decrease in net interest margin  but was also due to the purposeful decrease in average loans to be able to focus on asset quality and to improve liquidity and profitability 
short term interest rates remained unchanged throughout from the steep decline in by basis points  which negatively impacted net interest margin 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned million  or of total interest income  while the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned million  or of total interest income  during the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets during with an average tax equivalent yield of  total securities contributed million  or of total interest income  in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income  in during  the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets 
with an average tax equivalent yield of  total securities contributed million  or of total interest income  in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income  in during  the total securities portfolio and total short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets 
with an average yield of  securities contributed million  or of total interest income  in  while total short term investments had a combined average yield of and earned  or of total interest income in interest expense is primarily generated from money market deposits and certificates of deposit  which equaled and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during  and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during  and and  respectively  of average interest bearing liabilities during total borrowings were   and of average interest bearing liabilities during  and  respectively 
money market balances had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in  compared to an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in certificates of deposit had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in  compared to an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  in interest expense on savings and interest bearing checking totaled of total interest expense during and of total interest expense during the company paid million of interest expense on borrowings  or of total interest expense  during and paid million of interest expense on borrowings  or of total interest expense  during during  money market accounts had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense  while certificates of deposit had an average rate of and cost million  or of total interest expense 
savings deposits and interest bearing checking accounts totaled of average interest bearing liabilities during with an average rate of  or of total interest expense  in total borrowings had an average rate of during provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for  million for and million for in  the amount recorded to provision expense was driven by a downturn in the economy that led to further deterioration in market values of commercial real estate  primarily consisting of acquisition and development of residential real estate projects 
a portion of the provision expense was primarily due to significant charge offs related to a group of pre residential real estate development loans made up of different parties within the same development 
the economic downturn also had an effect on a few commercial loan relationships requiring specific reserves and charge offs due to liquidation of tho se businesses 
the provision expense reflects a million increase from the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
in  as the economy started to deteriorate and the residential development and home building sectors were severely weakened  we continued to increase our overall loan reserve in anticipation of stress on certain portions of our loan portfolio 
in  we continued this trend of increasing reserves  but we also used the allowance through charging off million in commercial lending relationships and million in commercial real estate lending relationships 
of these charge offs  several of these relationships were originated prior to tightening our lending policy  which would not have allowed the loans to be approved either because of the loan structure or the size of the investment in the loan 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   a decrease of million from the million of nonperforming loans at december  nonperforming loans were million at december  we reported million of net charge offs  or of average loans  during compared to million in net charge offs  or 
of average loans  during and million in net charge offs during net loans decreased during by million  or approximately  due to the company s focus on improving asset quality  profitability  and liquidity  along with a recognition of declining economic trends 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
noninterest income was negatively impacted in by an other than temporary impairment on two securities of  in there were no charges for other than temporary impairment in or due to the drastic decrease in security market values in the latter half of  fees from trust and brokerage services declined 
assets under management have increased by million from december   but have not yet returned to the record high of million set in may causing a reduction in the fee income of  in compared to the trust and brokerage fee income in was  higher than the million reported in loan broker fees were  during  an increase of  or  from  for loan broker fees were  for the increase in and was attributable to an effort to place less real estate mortgages in our portfolio and to sell them to the secondary market compared to years and prior 
deposit service charges were million in  showing a decrease of  or  from deposit service charges increased  or  between and in addition to the above  noninterest income results included a gain of  in and a gain of  in on the sale of securities available for sale 
there was a loss of  on the sale of afs securities in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or  during over the increase in expenses is attributable to an increase in fdic insurance premiums  an increase in loan and professional expenses  and an increase in the costs and valuation expenses on other real estate owned offset by a decrease in employment costs 
salary and benefit costs decreased  or  and were of total noninterest expenses 
during the second half of  the bank reduced its workforce by full time employees  which will create an annual savings of approximately million 
while we incurred additional expenses of approximately  for the early retirement of our chairman of the board in due to the discounted payment of his contracted salary and the acceleration of his accrual of supplemental executive retirement plan serp benefits  we will save approximately  per year in and due to a reduction in his contractual payments as defined in his serp 
with the decrease in employees  we also saw a decrease in the business development expenses by  from to loan and prof essional costs increased during from prior year levels by  or 
legal and professional expenses increased through a consulting engagement incurred to analyze our lending staffing and processes 
the engagement included analyzing current staffing levels and our internal approval processes for commercial and consumer loans 
the engagement resulted in the creation of a centralized underwriting function for consumer loans and making necessary staffing adjustments in the areas of credit and lending 
these expenses also increased due to additional costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic have continued to increase in and an industry wide one time special assessment of  in the second quarter was made causing a total increase of  from to the increases in premiums over the past two years have been to offset bank failures and the additional operating expense incu rred from increased resolution activities 
real estate market values remained low in causing write downs and professional expenses of million on properties that have moved to other real estate owned 
other various expense categories decreased during  such as marketing and communication  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was million for   and in  we recorded a loss on a commercial letter of credit in other expenses in the amount of  during  salaries and benefits costs were million  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million 
additional large overhead expenses in included costs for professional fees and services  which amounted to million and data processing expenses of million 
significant noninterest expenses during were million for salary and benefit costs  million for occupancy and equipment costs  million for loan and professional costs  and data processing expense of  monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high but reflects a decrease in net interest income caused by steep interest rate cuts taken in that remained unchanged in  along with elevated expenses due to valuation adjustment to foreclosed assets and increased fdic premiums 
improvement in the efficiency ratio will be obtained through an increase in revenue  both net interest income and fee income  and a reduction in operating expenses 
during we made significant strides in improving our net interest margin  which will translate into improved net interest income 
additionally operating expenses reduction of approximately million took place in in the form of staff reductions 
based on these changes  management anticipates an improved efficiency ratio for income taxes expense 
during  we recorded million of income tax benefit 
in and  we recorded  of income tax expense and million of income tax benefit  respectively 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for the income tax benefit recorded in was the result of a net loss posted and was offset by writing off our state deferred tax asset 
the company formed a real estate investment trust reit in that provides us with an alternative vehicle for raising capital should we so desire and also provides us with certain state income tax benefits to lower our effective tax rate 
the reit has provided several tax benefits for the comp any since  but has also created a large state net operating loss 
with the net loss posted in  the company decided that the state deferred tax asset created from the state net operating loss was more likely than not unrealizable and wrote it off  causing an offset of  to the income tax benefit 
the effective interest rate was low in due to modest levels of income before tax 
the low effective tax rate in was primarily due to modest levels of income offset by tax exempt investment income derived from investing in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
the tax benefit in is the result of the net loss posted  as well as certain tax exempt interest income 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stockholders equity decreased during from a net loss of million and  from stock option and restricted stock compensation expense 
the decrease was offset by a capital raise through the sale of  shares of series a convertible non cumulative preferred stock in the amount of million on september  affecting the increase in stockholders equity during was a net income of million  dividends of  and the repurchase of common stock of  this was somewhat offset by  for the net exercise of stock options  and  from stock option compensation expense 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in we refined our capital contingency plan and we have established new internal minimum capital levels that are in excess of those required by the regulators to remain well capitalized 
the plan provides that our total risk based capital ratio should be equal to or greater than and our leverage ratio should be equal to or greater than 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends at annual rate of per share payable in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to pay a dividend of per share for the first quarter dividend payment 
in the second quarter of  however  we elected to forego the declaration of dividends on our common stock indefinitely 
the decision was based on the desire to retain capital and hedge against challenging economic and banking industry conditions as well as to maintain tower bank s current well capitalized status within the federal reserve system 
as a result of resolutions adopted in  the company and the bank need to receive the approval of the federal reserve bank of chicago prior to declaring an dividends 
liquidity and capital ratios december  loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  cash flow from securities  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
as net loans declined by million we were able to allow higher costing deposits to run off 
overall deposits declined by million compared to a decline in deposits from to of million 
we mainly generated deposits from in market sources  however  we expanded our funding base during to include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities 
during we further expanded our funding base to include brokered deposits 
at december   the balance in brokered cds and fhlb borrowings were million and million respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  we expect the loan portfolio to remain unchanged through funding for the loan portfolio will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment interest rate sensitivity strategies and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased along with borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and million at december  the unused line at the discount window totaled million at december  and million at december  we view this type of funding as a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may re quire payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower

under our policy  a related person is a person who is  or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year was a director or executive officer  a nominee to become a director  a shareholder who beneficially owns or more of our common stock  an immediate family member that is  a spouse  child  parent  sibling  or an in law of any of the foregoing persons  as well as any entity which is owned or controlled by any of such persons or of which such person is a general partner or a or greater beneficial owner or any other person identified by our audit committee or our board as a related person for purposes of this policy 
once a person has been identified as related person and if tower financial corporation or any subsidiary is a participant  then if the aggregate amount involved in the transaction exceeds  and the related person has a direct or indirect interest other than simply as a result of being a director or less than a beneficial owner of the entity involved the transaction must be considered  approved or ratified by the audit committee 
we have established the threshold transactional amount at  which triggers the review  even though applicable sec regulations set the threshold at  we have done this so that even smaller transactions with related persons will be reviewed for fairness and appropriateness 
employment of a related person in the ordinary course of business consistent with our policies and practices with respect to the employment of non related persons in similar positions so long as the related person is not an executive officer required to be reported in our annual proxy statement is not subject to the policy 
transactions involving competitive bids or transactions involving services as a bank depository  transfer agent  registrar  or trustee are considered pre approved for purposes of our policy 
all other transactions subject to our policy must be approved in advance by the audit committee  unless our chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that it is impractical to wait until an audit committee meeting 
in such event  the chair of the audit committee may review and approve the proposed related person transaction but shall then promptly report any such approval to the full audit committee 
all material facts respecting the related person transaction must be disclosed to the audit committee 
in the event that we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been approved prior to its consummation  the matter must then still be reviewed by the audit committee  which will then review all relevant facts and circumstances  shall evaluate all available options including ratification  revision or te rmination of the transaction  and shall take such course of action as it deems appropriate 
in reviewing any related person transaction  the audit committee must consider the proposed benefits to the company  the availability of other sources of comparable products or services  an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is at least on terms comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally  and must then determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the company 
financial condition during  we continued to moderate the bank s loan growth as elected toward the middle of  while continuing to grow the trust company and our investment portfolio 
total assets were million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in assets was mainly attributable to a purposeful decrease in the loan portfolio to allow the company to focus on improving asset quality and increasing liquidity 
the decrease in loans was followed by a decrease in deposits which was primarily allowing higher cost deposits to runoff 
asset growth had been substantial during each year since we began operations  but slowed and even declined since due to management s decision to focus on improving asset quality  increa sing liquidity  and improving profitability while factoring in the uncertain and challenging economic times ahead 
management anticipates that  in the near term  asset growth will be minimal 
any growth experienced will be primarily from the marketing of our products  providing banking expertise and trust services  delivering a high level of customer service and developing our branch network 
earning assets 
the bank s net loans experienced a decline of million  or  during total loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates and were made to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentr ations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate categories are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at million  or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at million  or of total loans 
while the general portfolio mix has remained about the same  the main direction the bank has taken was to put more resources into the commercial versus the commercial real estate product 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team

these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectability 
identified probl em loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist

we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations

the portfolio will continue to include some short term liquid holdings from time to time based on liquidity needs 
since the inception of the company  all securities have been designated as available for sale and held to maturity as defined by accounting standards 
securities designated as available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity

the company  through the bank s investment subsidiary  owns a million original investment in pretsl xxv  a pooled trust preferred investment with a book value of million at the time of purchase 
this is the company s only pooled trust preferred security and is classified as a collateralized debt obligation 
at december   the market value of the investment was  and the book value was  the investment was rated ca by moody s and c by fitch 
the investment is divided into seven tranches 
tower s investment is in the fifth tranche c  meaning the cashflows on the investment are subordinated to the higher placed tranches 
there are sixty eight issuing participants in pretsl xxv 
fifty eight of the issuers are banks or bank holding companies  with the remaining issuers being insurance companies 
as of december   the amount of deferrals and defaults was million  or of the total pool 
of the total million of original collateral  million is currently paying interest 
the defaults and deferrals occurred as follows deferral default march  september  december  march  june  september  december  million of defaults at december  were reported as deferrals in september  the company uses an otti evaluation model to compare the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimate to determine whether an adverse change in cash flows has occurred during the quarter 
the otti model considers the structure and term of the collateralized debt obligation cdo and the financial condition of the underlying issuers 
specifically  the model details interest rates  principal balances of note classes and underlying issuers  the timing and amount of interest and principal payments of the underlying issuers  and the allocation of the payments to the note classes 
the current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of underlying trust preferred securiti es 
assumptions used in the model include expected future default rates and prepayments 
we assume that all interest payment deferrals will become defaults prior to their next payment dates and that there will be no recoveries on defaults 
in addition we use the model to stress each cdo  or make assumptions more severe than expected activity  to determine the degree to which assumptions could deteriorate before the cdo could no longer fully support repayment of tower s note class 
we evaluate the credit quality of each underlying issuer in the pool and apply a risk rating for each issuer and then put this risk rating into a relevant risk model to identify immediate default risk 
upon completion of the december  analysis  our model indicated that the security was other than temporarily impaired 
based on this conclusion at december   the investment had otti of approximately  or  the company owns a private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo with an original investment of million 
at december   the market value of the investment was  and the book value was  the investment was rated caa by moody s and ccc by s p 
this bond is classified as a super senior tranche because its cash flow is not subordinated to any other tranche in the deal and is classified as a mortgage backed security residential 
we used the intex database to evaluate and model each individual loan in the underlying collateral of this security 
in  we noticed that the credit quality of the underlying collateral was marginally deteriorating causing us to more aggressively monitor and analyze for other than temporary impairment 
to monitor this investment  management has evaluated loan delinquencies  foreclosures  other real estate owned oreo and bankruptcies as shown in the table below prior to making assumptions on the performing loans 
december september june march delinquency delinquency other real estate owned foreclosure bankruptcy we utilized intex data to determine the default assumptions for all loans that are classified as past due  oreo or in foreclosure 
a severity rate was assumed on all defaults 
this number was derived from the pool  average over the last months 
the default rate differs for each state based on the severity of that state s home price depreciation and the number of days the loan is past due 
any foreclosure or loan classified as oreo is immediately liquidated at a severity 
the current loan category is stratified by fico scores and the level of asset documentation full documentation  low documentation  or no documentation 
the loan performance database driven by intex data is mined for historical probabilities of loans meeting these characteristics moving into default 
this was done for   and periods 
the average default rate is then calculated  as well as its standard deviation 
two standard deviations are then added to this mean to derive the current loan cdr assumptions  representing what management feels is a stressed scenario 
we used the yield at the time of purchase as the discount rate for the cash flow analysis 
at the time of purchase the bond was yielding 
therefore  all cash flows in the otti analysis were discounted by to get a present value 
to determine the fair value  we surveyed two bond desks to see what yield it would take to sell the bond in the open market 
both desks said it would take a yield of to get someone to buy this bond 
management decided to use the conservative figure and discounted the cash flows by 
the two bonds desks that were surveyed are sterne agee and performance trust 
based on the analysis performed using the assumptions above  we have determined that this private label cmo is other than temporarily impaired requiring us to record a credit impairment of  as of december  short term investments and fed funds sold federal funds sold  consisting of excess funds sold overnight to correspondent banks  and short term investments and interest bearing deposits  consisting of certificates of deposit with maturities less than days and interest bearing accounts at correspondent banks  are used to manage daily liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity

we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  we did have borrowings in the amount of million in fhlb bullet advances and million in variable rate advances at december  compared to million of bullet advances at december  as noted above  the increase in fhlb borrowings during was a result of the drop in deposits due to interest rate decreases 
we had million of aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and we currently have two statutory trust subsidiaries

in january  at the request of our regulators  our board of directors adopted a resolution requiring that we seek written approval from the federal reserve bank of chicago prior to incurring any additional parent company debt  including the addition of trust preferred securities and advances on any existing lines of credit 
in january  the board of directors adopted a resolution that supersedes the one from january that states the company will refrain from making interest payments of interest on existing trust preferred securities without first obtaining written approval from the federal reserve bank 
per the debenture agreements  we have the ability to defer payment of the interest for twenty consecutive quarters 
on february   we sent written notice to the trustees of the trust p referred securities stating that we elected to defer payment of the interest for the first quarter of in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of outstanding common stock

additional measures taken by our board of directors and management to preserve capital and mitigate capital risk during the first quarter of  the boards of the company and the bank  as well as our management teams  adopted various measures that we believe will allow us to continue to preserve capital and mitigate further capital risk in light of our net loss and our level of non performing assets  which continues to be elevated compared to historical levels 
we have adopted many of these measures in conjunction with extensive discussion with our banking regulators 
these measures include we have reviewed and revised our loan policies with regard to how we establish interest rate reserves  we have modified the appropriate time frame for new appraisals for collateral dependent loans  and we have enhanced our internal loan grading system to help ensure timely adjustment of loan risk ratings 
we have developed enhanced processes for the renewal of credit to any borrower who has a loan or other extension of credit on our internal watch list 
our enhanced processes include increased use of expanded cash flow analysis for the entire borrowing relationship  as well as an increased number of loans that require approval by the full bank board and or a committee of the board 
we have expanded the level of detail for all asset improvement plans and we have increased the regularity of reporting such plans to the board in order to improve our ability to reduce both non performing loans and reduce the number of foreclosed assets on our balance sheet 
as part of our efforts to ensure complete understanding by the board and the continued adherence to regulatory guidelines regarding our process for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses alll  we have further enhanced our level of board review  education  and approval of our ongoing methodology 
we have further refined our capital contingency plan and we have established new internal minimum capital levels that are in excess of those required by the regulators to remain well capitalized 
the plan provides that our total risk based capital ratio should be equal to or greater than and our leverage ratio should be equal to or greater than 
as of december   the company s total risk based capital ratio and leverage capital ratio were and  respectively 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of our ratios 
we have further refined and outlined the company s liquidity policy and liquidity funding plan  and  given the uncertainty in the marketplace and exposure to increasing interest rates in the future  we have enhanced the monitoring  analysis  and reporting of our cash flow and interest rate forecast 
the company will not pay dividends on our common stock  the series a convertible non cumulative preferred stock or other capital stock  or make any payments of interest on our trust preferred debt without written approval from the federal reserve bank of chicago

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our sa fety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis in thousands within three months three to twelve months one to five years after five years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities held to maturity securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock loans held for sale fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results wil l differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities
