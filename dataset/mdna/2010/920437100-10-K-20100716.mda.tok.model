business environment during the company s fourth quarter ended april   the global financial markets continued to improve from the march market lows 
the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average declined and respectively from the end of september to march  from that point to april   those indices have rallied nearly and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended april   the nasdaq and dow jones industrial average were up and  respectively 
but the severe downturn and volatility in the financial markets throughout the prior fiscal year continue to negatively impact the company s revenues  assets under management and the assets attributable to third party copyright data partners as compared to the twelve months of the previous fiscal year 
although we have not suffered a fundamental change in our business model  the business environment remains challenging for our business 
in response  we continue to be diligent both in our operational and marketing execution and in controlling expenses 
results of operations the operating results of the company for fiscal year show its worst performing year since going public in due to the provision for the sec settlement  which was reached in november excluding the sec settlement  the company was profitable in its operations  albeit  revenues from each business line to be discussed in further detail  have deteriorated from the previous year

while the company continues to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels  primarily direct mail and the internet  total product line circulation continues to decline 
factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients 
as of april   total company wide circulation has dropped compared to the previous fiscal year 
overall renewal rates for the flagship product  the value line investment survey  are  up from a year earlier  however  the company is not adding enough new subscribers to offset the subscribers that choose not to renew to the flagship product and the other products 
the company has been successful in growing electronic investment periodicals revenues within institutional sales  which increased  or from the previous year 
fiscal year gross institutional sales through april  were  up  or from the previous fiscal year 
this continues to be a positive trend  but not sufficient to offset the lost revenue from retail subscribers 
within investment periodicals and related publications are subscription revenues derived from print and electronic products 
the following chart illustrates the year to year change in the revenues associated with print and electronic subscriptions 
subscription revenues year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs print publication revenues electronic publication revenues total investment periodicals and related publications revenue unearned revenues short and long term for the twelve months ended april   print publication revenues decreased  or from the last fiscal year for the reasons described earlier 
print circulation  which has always dominated our subscription base  has fallen from the last fiscal year 
electronic publications revenues were down  for the twelve months ended april  all the retail electronic services continued to decline in circulation from the prior fiscal year 
the electronic publication revenues are broken down into institutional accounts and retail subscribers 
for the twelve months ended april   institutional revenues increased  or  while revenues from retail subscribers were down  or as compared to the twelve months ended april  the company has relied more on its institutional sales marketing efforts  and the increase in institutional revenues is a direct result of a focused effort for sales to colleges  libraries and corporate accounts 
the decrease in electronic retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products  which continue to decline 
the value line timeliness ranking systemtm the ranking system  a component in the company s flagship product  the value line investment survey  is also an important part of the company s copyright data business 
as stated in recent quarterly filings  the rapid and severe price actions in the markets in appear to have favored short term investing  as investors bought well known names whose earnings have plunged but whose stock prices were depressed in hopes the stock prices would rebound 
such stocks are generally not well ranked by value line because the ranking system emphasizes earnings results and price momentum 
the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period 
during the six months and fiscal quarter ended april   the combined value line timeliness rank stock performance of and  allowing for weekly changes in ranks  compares favorably to the and return of the s p index  respectively 
the company and its quantitative research staff continue to work diligently to improve the ranking system s predictive performance although no assurances are possible 
copyright data fees copyright data fees have decreased  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months ended april  as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data and represent billion in various products as compared to four contracts and billion in assets last fiscal year  representing a increase in assets year end over year end 
despite the increase in year end assets under management from april  to april   average assets under management during the year ended april  were greater than for the year ended april  the combination of the underperformance by the ranking system and the broad and deep declines in the equity markets from late and early significantly impacted assets of the third party sponsors that are customers of our copyright data business which resulted in lower asset based fees paid to the company 
the company believes the growth of this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products 
today this market is significantly more competitive as a result of product diversification and growth of the use of indices by portfolio managers 
copyright data fees have been a critical component of the company s plan to replace shrinking publishing revenues but no new contracts have been added in fiscal year investment management fees and distribution services revenues overall fund assets are flat compared to the end of the last fiscal year

over the past several years  the company has saved money by combining the roles and responsibilities of various personnel and by selective outsourcing

as previously mentioned the ranking system s sometimes inconsistent performance and competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients contributed to the decline in revenue 
the recession and turmoil in the markets have also contributed to the decline in subscriptions as individuals reduced many forms of discretionary spending  or have shifted investments to fixed income  for which the company only provides research on mutual funds and etf vehicles 
investment periodicals  publishing copyright data segment profit margin from operations decreased as a direct result of the decline in revenue 
investment management revenues from the company s investment management business segment declined significantly from the previous fiscal year primarily due to the decline in investment management fees from the company s family of mutual funds that was a direct result of the deterioration in the underlying assets under management and fee waivers

effective income tax rate the overall effective income tax rate  as a percentage of pre tax ordinary income for the twelve months ended april  and april  was and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the income tax rate is attributable to the non deductible portion of the provision for the sec settlement described in note legal proceedings within the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements as of april  and the change in the non taxable investment income  events that do not have tax consequences 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of april  and  as of april  working capital as of april  has been reduced by a provision of  relating to the sec settlement of which million was paid in november and the payment of per share special dividend during the fourth quarter of fiscal in lieu of the regular

cash from operating activities the company had cash outflows from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  as compared to cash inflows from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  this was a result of the payment pursuant to the sec settlement of million to the fair fund in november  which was partially offset by the proceeds from sale of fixed income securities within the company s trading portfolio to fund the sec settlement 
otherwise  the company had positive cash flows from its operating activities for fiscal year cash from investing activities the company s cash inflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  was lower than cash inflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  cash inflows in fiscal were higher as a result of sales of the company s entire equity portfolio during fiscal year ended april  and partial sale of fixed income securities during fiscal to fund the sec settlement 
cash from financing activities the company s net cash outflow from financing activities of  as of april  was higher than cash outflow from financing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  the increase in cash outflow during fiscal resulted from the payment of five dividends during fiscal including a special per share dividend paid in april  in the aggregate amount of per share compared with four dividends totaling per share for the fiscal year ended april  management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity 
management does not anticipate any borrowing in fiscal retained earnings were nearly million and liquid assets million at year end april  critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes reserve for settlement expenses revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and electronic subscriptions  investment management and service and distribution fees  and fees for copyright proprietary information 
the company recognizes subscription revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service 
investment management fees and service and distribution fee revenues for the value line funds are recognized each month based upon the daily net asset value of each fund 
copyright data fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income and income from securities transactions will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax return the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april   the company had  of deferred tax assets  which included  of short term deferred federal  state  and local taxes related to the current year nol carryforward of million 
in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
reserve for settlement expenses the company has  in accrued liabilities to reserve for expenses related to the sec settlement 
this expense is an estimate related to the fair fund creation and administration required by the sec to distribute the proceeds of the fair fund 
included in the estimate are calculations for the third party administrator  tax advisor  legal  and transfer agent work to identify shareholders  and to calculate and distribute the proceeds of the fair fund 
these costs are estimates based on the scope of the work and bids received from the third party vendors 
due to the complexity of the fair fund distribution  these estimates are subject to change with a positive or negative impact to the company predicated on the complexity of the calculation and determination of shareholders who will receive distributions from the fair fund 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations below is a summary of certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on balance sheet total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk  although the company disposed of its entire portfolio of equity securities during the fiscal year ended april  and held no equity securities during the fiscal year ended april  the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s business activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk 
despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in six months to three years 
the fair values of the company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
in fiscal year and at the end of fiscal year  value line did not hold equity securities
