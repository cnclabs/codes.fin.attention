item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
executive summary introduction biogen idec is a global biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas with high unmet medical needs 
our business strategy is focused on discovering and developing first in class or best in class products that we can deliver to specialty markets globally 
patients around the world benefit from biogen idec s significant products that address medical needs in the areas of neurology  oncology and immunology 
in the near term  we are dependent on continued sales of avonex  rituxan and tysabri to drive our revenue growth 
in the longer term  our revenue growth is also dependent on the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products 
as part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts within our core and emergent areas of neurology  oncology  immunology  cardiopulmonary and hemophilia 

table of contents financial highlights the following table is a summary of financial results achieved change for the years ended december  compared in millions  except per share amounts and percentages to total revenues income from operations net income attributable to biogen idec inc diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen idec inc as described below under results of operations  our operating results for the year ended december   were primarily driven by increased avonex worldwide revenue 
total avonex revenues were  million in  representing a increase over continued tysabri growth 
global in market net sales of tysabri totaled  million in our share of tysabri revenues totaled million in  representing an increase of over us in market net sales of rituxan totaled  million in  representing an increase of over our share of rituxan revenues totaled  million in  which is inclusive of our share of co promotion profits in the us totaling million  representing an increase of over this increase was offset by a million decrease in our share of revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
total costs and expenses increased as compared to this increase was driven by a increase in research and development spending and a increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to tysabri growth 
these increases were offset by a decrease in costs of sales  a reduction in selling  general and administrative expense of  and a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets of 
in addition to the strong operating results achieved  we generated  million of net cash flows from operations during  which were primarily driven by increases in our earnings 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  million as of december  business highlights in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock  with repurchased shares being retired 
during  approximately million shares at a cost of million were repurchased under this and our share repurchase programs 
in june  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with acorda therapeutics  inc acorda to develop and commercialize products containing fampridine in markets outside the us in july  we made a million upfront payment pursuant to this agreement

in addition  during  we experienced higher participation in our access program  which provides free product to eligible patients 
for compared to  the decrease in rest of world avonex revenue was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar against relevant foreign currencies  primarily the euro  offset by increased patient demand and price increases in some countries 
for compared to  rest of world sales of avonex increased due to increased patient demand  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and the establishment of additional direct market affiliates

avonex rest of world revenues for  and also include losses of million  million and million  respectively  recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments 
continued growth of avonex revenue is primarily dependent on maintaining avonex s position as one of the most prescribed ms therapies in the world 
we expect to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world from existing and new ms treatments  including oral and other alternative formulations developed by our competitors  the continued growth of tysabri and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates  which may have a continued negative impact on the unit sales of avonex as well as increasing price pressure 
we continue to generate data showing avonex to be an effective and safe choice for ms patients and physicians 
tysabri we collaborate with elan pharma international  ltd elan an affiliate of elan corporation  plc  on the development and commercialization of tysabri 
please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements for a description of this collaboration 
in the us  we sell tysabri to elan who sells the product to third party distributors 
our sales price to elan in the us is set prior to the beginning of each quarterly period to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin on sales in the us between elan and us 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri in the us upon elan s shipment of the product to the third party distributors 
in the rest of world markets  we are responsible for distributing tysabri to customers and are primarily responsible for all operating activities 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri in the rest of world at the time of product delivery to our customers 
revenues from tysabri include our share of net us sales of tysabri from elan to third party customers  revenue on sales of tysabri in rest of world markets  amortization of deferred revenue amounts related to elan milestone payments made to us  and gains or losses recognized in relation to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted revenues 
revenues from tysabri are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to united states rest of world total tysabri revenues for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in us tysabri revenue was due to the continued increase in the number of patients using tysabri in the us increased commercial demand resulted in increases of and in us tysabri sales volume for and  respectively  over their prior year comparative periods 
net sales of tysabri from our collaboration partner  elan  to third party customers in the us for each of the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in rest of world tysabri revenue was due to the continued increase in the number of patients using tysabri in our rest of world markets 
increased commercial demand resulted in increases of and in us tysabri sales volume for and  respectively  over their prior year comparative periods 
the increase in tysabri revenues in was offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies  primarily the euro 

table of contents tysabri rest of world revenues for also include losses of million recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments  no such losses were recognized in or as we did not designate hedges against tysabri rest of world revenues in those periods 
in and  we recognized million and million respectively of product revenue related to the amortization of the elan milestone payments 
since we reintroduced tysabri to the market in july  some patients taking tysabri have been diagnosed with pml  a rare but serious brain infection described in the tysabri label 
in november  the us prescribing information for tysabri was revised to reflect that the risk of pml increases with longer treatment duration  and for patients treated for to months is generally similar to the rates seen in clinical trials 
the revised label also reflects that there is limited experience beyond three years of treatment 
in january  the ema recommended updating the tysabri label in the eu to reflect that the risk of pml increases after two years of therapy 
the ema also recommended that patients have regular mri scans and be reinformed of the risk of pml after two years of therapy 
we continue to monitor the growth of tysabri unit sales  which may be further impacted by the updated prescribing information 
we continue to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients being treated with tysabri 
we are working to identify patient or viral characteristics which contribute to the risk of developing pml  including the presence of asymptomatic jc virus infection with a serological assay for antibodies against the jc virus 
our efforts to improve management by physicians of pml and to improve patient outcomes have included researching plasma exchange to more rapidly remove tysabri from a patient  and drug screening that identified mefloquine as an anti jc virus drug candidate 
other product revenues other product revenues represent revenues derived from fumaderm  zevalin and amevive and are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to fumaderm zevalin amevive total other product revenues unconsolidated joint business revenues we collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements for a description of this collaboration 
the majority of rituxan unit sales are for use in oncology as a treatment for certain types of b cell nhl 
we believe there is opportunity for rituxan unit sales growth in the immunology setting  where rituxan is used as a treatment for certain types of ra 
additional immunology indications for rituxan that we are investigating include anca associated vasculitis 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of pretax co promotion profits in the us  reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the us  and revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world  which consist of our share of pretax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche and its sublicensees 
pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by genentech in the us and by roche in canada 
pre tax co promotion profits consist of us and canadian sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech  roche and us 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of revenues from unconsolidated joint business change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to biogen idec s share of co promotion profits in the us reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the us revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world total unconsolidated joint business revenues biogen idec s share of co promotion profits in the us the following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of co promotion profits in the us change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to product revenues  net costs and expenses co promotion profits in the united states biogen idec inc s share of co promotion profits in the united states for compared to  the increase in us rituxan product revenue on sales recorded by genentech resulted from continued growth for treatment of b cell nhl and ra  and price increases 
for compared to the increase in us rituxan product revenue was primarily due to increased unit sales in treatments of b cell nhl  cll an unapproved and unpromoted use of rituxan and ra  and price increases 
collaboration costs and expenses for as compared to decreased primarily due to higher costs incurred in development of rituxan for use in other indications during under our collaboration agreement  our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  provides for a share of co promotion profits on the first million of co promotion operating profit with our share increasing to if co promotion operating profits exceed million 
in   and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
in addition  under our collaboration agreement  we have rights to collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of anti cd products that genentech acquires or develops  which we refer to as new anti cd products  and anti cd products that genentech licenses from a third party  which we refer to as third party anti cd products 
our collaboration rights for new anti cd products are limited to the us and our collaboration rights for third party anti cd products are dependent upon genentech s underlying license rights 
there is only one new anti cd product  ocrelizumab  and only one third party anti cd product  ga our agreement with genentech also provides that the successful development and commercialization of the first new anti cd product will decrease our percentage of co promotion profits of the collaboration 
please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pretax co promotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and new anti cd products sold by us and genentech following the approval date of the first new anti cd product 
we will participate in third party anti cd products on similar financial terms as for ocrelizumab 

table of contents reimbursement of selling and development expense in the us as discussed within note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue 
selling and development expenses  incurred by us in the us and reimbursed by genentech  increased in as compared due to an increase in sales and marketing expense associated with cll and legal fees 
the increase in selling and development expenses in compared to was primarily due to development costs we incurred related to the development of rituxan in ra 
revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world we record our royalty revenue and co promotion profit revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world on a cash basis 
revenues on sales of rituxan in the rest of world decreased in compared to primarily due to royalty expirations in certain of these markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes 
revenues on sales of rituxan in the rest of world increased in compared to due to several factors  including increased market penetration in nhl and increased use in ra 
the royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
for the majority of european countries  the first commercial sale of rituxan occurred in the second half of specifically  the royalty periods with respect to sales in france  spain  germany and the united kingdom expired in the royalty period with respect to sales in italy will expire in the royalty periods with respect to sales in other countries will subsequently expire through as a result of these expirations  we expect royalty revenues derived from sales of rituxan in the rest of world to continue to decline in future years 
other revenues our product line previously included zevalin ibritumomab tiuxetan which is part of a treatment regimen for certain b cell nhl  and amevive alefacept  a treatment for certain moderate to severe psoriasis 
we have sold or exclusively licensed the rights to these products to third parties and continue to receive supply agreement revenues based on those products which are included in corporate partner revenues 
we also receive royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of other products under patents that we own 
other revenues are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to royalty revenues corporate partner revenues other revenues royalty revenues we receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own 
sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition  manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control 
in addition  the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents 
the increase in royalty revenues in as compared to  as well as in as compared to  was primarily due to increased sales of angiomax bivalirudin licensed to the medicines company tmc offset by a decline in royalties from sales of other licensed product and the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements 

table of contents our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from sales of angiomax by tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us  europe  canada  and latin america for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
royalty revenues related to the sales of angiomax are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with tmc 
the royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year 
the increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year 
this formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters 
accordingly  an adjustment is recorded in the period in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved 
under the terms of our agreement  tmc is obligated to pay us royalties earned  on a country by country basis  until the later of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of angiomax in such country and the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a patent in such country 
the annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share 
tmc began selling angiomax in the us in january the principal us patent that covers angiomax expires in march the fda has granted tmc an additional period of marketing exclusivity for angiomax in order to investigate its use in pediatric patients 
this period expires in september in the event that third parties sell products comparable to angiomax after the period of marketing exclusivity expires  we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to lower royalty rates and increased competition 
provisions for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veterans administration va rebates  managed care rebates  product returns  and other applicable allowances 
reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable if the amount is payable to our customer or a liability if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer 
for compared to  as well as compared to  the increases in total allowances were primarily due to price increases 
our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual requirements  statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data  as adjusted  to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product 
reserves for discounts  contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues were as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to discounts contractual adjustments returns total allowances gross product revenues percent of gross product revenues 
table of contents discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases 
contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid  va and managed care rebates and other applicable allowances 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  contractual adjustments increased primarily due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and price increases in the us and medicaid and va programs associated with price increases in the us product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
we also accept returns from our patients for various reasons 
for compared to  return reserves remained relatively unchanged 
for compared to  return reserves decreased primarily due to a decrease in estimated product returns based on historical trends 
costs and expenses a summary of total costs and expenses is as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to cost of sales  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets research and development selling  general and administrative collaboration profit sharing amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired in process research and development facility impairments and gain loss on disposition  net costs and expenses cost of sales  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets cost of sales components of cost of sales are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to cost of product revenues cost of royalty revenues cost of sales for compared to  the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in write downs from unmarketable inventory of million  decreased production costs of approximately million resulting from the implementation of a new high titer production process which produces higher yields of tysabri and an million decrease in royalty payments on sales of licensed product due mainly to the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in costs associated with higher tysabri sales volume 
in addition  during we also incurred a million period expense related to the shutdown of our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina for the implementation of the high titer production process upgrades 

table of contents for as compared to  the overall increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher sales volume offset by decreased write downs from unmarketable inventory 
write downs from unmarketable inventory our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
the shelf life associated with our products is generally between and months  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant 
amounts written down related to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales  and totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to research and development we devote significant resources to research and development programs focusing our efforts on finding novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need within our core and emergent focus areas of neurology  oncology  immunology  cardiopulmonary and hemophilia 
over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to the development of new product candidates and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders in addition to those currently approved in their labels 
costs associated with later stage clinical trials are  in most cases  more significant than those incurred in earlier stages of our pipeline 
research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities  including compensation and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  fees paid to clinical research organizations cros and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
for compared to  research and development expenses increased by million  driven primarily by the million upfront payment made to acorda  as well as a net increase of million related to the ramp up of clinical trial activity for certain development stage product candidates including lixivaptan  bg  humanized anti cd and adentri 
in addition  in  we initiated registrational trials in our pegylated interferon program 
the aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction of spending across several programs including baminercept in ra  lumiliximab and volociximab 
for compared to  research and development expenses increased by million  driven by an increase of million related to the continued advancement of our pipeline into phase clinical trials 
in  we initiated a registrational trial in our lixivaptan program  a phase trial in our adentri program  and continued to develop our bg  anti cd mab galiximab and anti cd mab lumiliximab programs 
in  we had programs in phase clinical trials as compared to in we also increased spending in our anti cd programs in both phase and phase clinical trials by million primarily due to a million opt in payment to participate in the roche led ga program 
the balance of the increase of million was due to other research and development investments  primarily in our pre clinical and early stage pipeline programs including hsp  biib  bart and lingo programs 
we expect total research and development expense in to be between and of total revenue 

table of contents milestone and upfront payments milestone and upfront payments made to our collaboration partners and included within research and development expense are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to total milestone and upfront payments reflected within research and development expense for as compared to  the increase in milestone and upfront payments was primarily the result of the million upfront payment made to acorda 
selling  general and administrative change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  outside marketing and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs 
for compared to  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a reduction of expenses reimbursed to elan for their marketing of tysabri for crohn s disease in the us these decreases were offset by costs incurred associated with our geographic expansion into new markets 
for compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a million increase in sales and marketing  of which million related to international sales and marketing activities primarily for avonex and tysabri and million related to an increase in compensation and benefits for general and administrative personnel as well as increases in fees and services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in as compared to the total amount incurred in primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of avonex and tysabri 
in addition  under the transition agreement entered into with james c 
mullen  we will incur approximately million of expense in the first half of all of which relates to the modification of his existing equity based compensation awards 
the substantial portion of this charge is due to the incremental value attributable to the extension of mr 
mullen s stock option awards 
collaboration profit sharing change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to collaboration profit sharing payments are made to elan for their share of the rest of world net operating profits to effect an equal sharing of collaboration operating profit 
these payments include the reimbursement of our portion of third party royalties that elan pays on behalf of the collaboration  relating to sales in the rest of world 
these amounts are reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line in our consolidated statements of income 
our collaboration profit sharing expense increases as rest of world sales of tysabri increase and is impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
for as compared to  as well as for as compared to  the increases were due to the continued increase in tysabri rest of world sales resulting in a higher rest of world net operating profits to be shared with elan and causing growth in the third party royalties elan paid on behalf of the collaboration 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  our collaboration profit sharing expense included million  million and million  respectively  related to the reimbursement of elan s royalty payments 
amortization of acquired intangible assets change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to amortization of acquired intangible assets our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product 
we refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model  which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model 
although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset  the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances  due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise 
in order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods  we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method 
amortization is then recorded based upon the higher of the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model or the minimum amortization amount determined under the straight line method 
we completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales of avonex and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
based on this analysis  we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of  and expect to apply the same model for the first two quarters in the results of our analysis were most significantly impacted by the issuance in september of a us patent covering the treatment of ms with avonex  which resulted in an increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of avonex and an extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset 
as a result of these changes in the total expected lifetime revenues of avonex  amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of decreased significantly over their respective prior year comparative periods 
based upon this most recent analysis  amortization of intangible assets  included within our consolidated balance sheet as of december   is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million for each of the next five years 
for compared to  the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the changes in the estimate of the future total expected lifetime revenues of avonex that occurred as part of the annual reassessment of amortization expense in the third quarters of and the change in the estimate of the future revenue of avonex was attributable to the expected impact of competitor products  including the commercialization of our own pipeline product candidates 
acquired in process research and development ipr d change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to acquired in process research and development effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations  which changes the accounting treatment of acquired ipr d 
for acquisitions occurring prior to january   we measured 
table of contents acquired ipr d at fair value and expensed it on the acquisition date  or capitalized it as intangible assets if certain criteria were met 
however  effective january   acquired ipr d will be measured at fair value and capitalized as intangible assets and amortized from the date of completion over its estimated useful life 
in addition  the acquired ipr d will be tested for impairment until completion of the acquired programs 
in  we recorded an ipr d charge of million related to a hsp related milestone payment made to the former shareholders of conforma therapeutics  inc conforma pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of conforma in during the year ended december   we recorded ipr d charges of million 
the principal components of this amount are as follows million related to the acquisition of syntonix pharmaceuticals syntonix  million related to the collaboration with cardiokine biopharma llc cardiokine  and million related to the collaboration with neurimmune subone ag neurimmune 
cardiokine and neurimmune are variable interest entities as defined under the guidance set forth within the consolidation topic of the codification 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in ipr d charges which have been recorded as a component of operating income 
however  because the ipr d charges relate to the fair value of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of cardiokine and neurimmune  these amounts were allocated to the respective noncontrolling interests 
we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair values associated with acquired technologies 
these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include but are not limited to an estimate of future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed and in process products and the use of discount and probability rates on a project basis 
refer to valuation of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses within critical accounting estimates for additional discussion 
we believe that the discount rates utilized in our valuations are commensurate with the stage of development of these compounds and uncertainties in the economic estimates associated with each development relationship 
the ipr d charge related to our collaboration with neurimmune was determined based upon an estimate of revenues expected to be recognized beginning in related to the beta amyloid antibody and a discount rate of 
the ipr d charge related to our collaboration with cardiokine was determined assuming a discount rate of and an estimate of revenues expected to be recognized beginning in for lixivaptan 
the amount allocated to ipr d resulting from the acquisition of syntonix relates to the development of long acting recombinant factor ix and long acting recombinant factor viii assuming estimated revenues expected to be recognized beginning in and  respectively 
a discount rate of was used to value these projects 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of syntonix in january  we agreed to make additional future consideration payments contingent upon the achievement of certain milestone events 
in accordance with our acquisition agreement  we will make a million milestone payment to the former shareholders of syntonix during the first quarter of this amount will be recorded as a charge to ipr d in the first quarter of refer to note  acquisitions and dispositions and note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other income expense  net components of other income expense  net  are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to interest income interest expense impairment on investments gain loss on sales of investments  net 
table of contents change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to foreign exchange gains losses  net gain on the sale of property other  net other income expense  net interest income for as compared to  interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  offset by higher average cash balances 
for compared to  interest income decreased primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the funding of our tender offer in july  a net payment of million for our term loan facility and lower investment yields 
interest expense for as compared to  interest expense decreased primarily due to decreased average debt balances 
in addition in  approximately million was recorded as a reduction of interest expense due to the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the termination of an interest rate swap in december this is further described in note  derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
for compared to  interest expense increased primarily due to an increased average debt balance as well as million of expense incurred in due to the impact of hedge ineffectiveness as discussed in note  derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
we capitalized interest costs related to construction in progress totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  which were primarily related to the development of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in hiller d  denmark  which as a result reduced our interest expense by the same amount 
we expect the amount of interest capitalized in relation to this facility will decrease in impairment on investments in april  we implemented newly issued accounting standards which provided guidance for recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  this standard amended the other than temporary impairment model for marketable debt securities 
the impairment model for equity securities was not affected 
refer to note  financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of this guidance 
in  we recognized impairment losses of million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional million in charges for the other than temporary impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities 
in  we recognized impairment losses of million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional million in impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage  asset backed and corporate securities 
in we recognized impairment losses of million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional million in impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities 
we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future 

table of contents impairment on property we own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories  office space  and biologic manufacturing operations  some of which are located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values 
if we decide to consolidate  co locate or dispose of certain aspects of our business operations  for strategic or other operational reasons  we may dispose of one or more of our properties 
due to reduced expectations of product demand  improved yields on production and other factors  we may not fully utilize our manufacturing facilities at normal levels resulting in idle time at facilities or substantial excess manufacturing capacity 
we are always evaluating our current strategy  as well as other alternatives  including whether to delay completion of the denmark facility 
if any of our owned properties are held for sale  or disposed of  we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges if the fair value of the properties were determined to be lower than their book value 
in addition  if we decide to fully or partially vacate a leased property  we may incur significant cost  including lease termination fees  rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements 
income tax provision tax rate change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to effective tax rate on pre tax income income tax expense our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the nature of our global operations 
the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions  changes in tax laws  acquisitions and licensing transactions 
in  our effective tax rate was impacted by the following significant items tax impact from licensing transaction during  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with acorda 
as there is no income tax benefit associated with either the million upfront payment made to acorda or our development spending on fampridine outside the us  these payments had a unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate 
tax impact from changes in tax laws we established deferred tax assets and adjusted certain deferred tax liabilities  and adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions  due to changes in tax laws in certain states in which we operate 
this had a favorable effect of on our effective tax rate 
tax impact from resolution of tax audits the resolution of federal  state and foreign tax audits resulted in reducing our reserves for several uncertain tax positions  which had a favorable effect of on our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate in was lower than in due to the net effect of the three items noted above and a higher percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to us income taxation in the effect of the allocation of earnings was partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets which will be realized as a result of our domestic reorganization 
our effective tax rate in was higher than primarily due to a reorganization of our international operations in and the allocation of our earnings subject to us taxation in each year 
the domestic and foreign reorganizations to our corporate structure involved the movement of certain personnel  operations and processes among our affiliates 
our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent on the allocation of our profits among jurisdictions and the percentage of our foreign earnings which are subject to taxation in the us we expect our effective tax rate to be between and 
this rate does not consider the impact of a potential renewal of the federal research and development tax credit 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity our financial condition is summarized as follows change as of december  compared in millions  except percentages to financial assets cash and cash equivalents marketable and loaned securities current marketable securities non current total financial assets borrowings current portion of notes payable and line of credit notes payable and line of credit total borrowings working capital for the year end december   certain significant cash flows were as follows  million of cash flows generated from operations  inclusive of the million upfront payment made to acorda on july   million used for share repurchases  million in total payments for income taxes  million used for net purchases of marketable securities  and million used for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
significant cash flow activities during included the net repayment of approximately million of indebtedness  million used to fund share repurchases  used for the net purchases of marketable securities  and million used to purchase property  plant and equipment offset by cash generated from operations of  million 
we have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through cash flows from our operations 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations  as well as existing cash resources 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of  and access to  financing are adequate to satisfy our operating  working capital  strategic alliance and acquisition  milestone payments  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives  including acquisition and licensing activities 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
please read the risk factors and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sections of this report for items that could negatively impact our cash position and ability to fund future operations 
share repurchase programs in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock  with repurchased shares being retired 
this repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
as of december   approximately million shares at a cost of million were repurchased under this program  all of which were retired 
from january  through february   we repurchased approximately an additional million shares under this program at a total cost of approximately million  all of which were also retired 
approximately million remains available for the repurchase of our common stock under the program 
the remaining shares that may be purchased under this program is subject to price fluctuations of our common stock 

table of contents in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program was completed during the fourth quarter of during  approximately million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately million under this program 
during  approximately million shares of our common stock were repurchased for approximately million under this program 
we used the share repurchase program principally for share stabilization 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  us and foreign government instruments and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
we attempt to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution  maturity  and investment type 
in particular  the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in the value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
the increase in cash and marketable securities as of december  as compared to december  is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment  share repurchases  payments pursuant to our collaboration agreement with acorda and other collaboration arrangements  and purchases of strategic investments 
borrowings there have been no significant changes in our borrowings since december  on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march  for proceeds of million  net of issuance costs 
the credit rating on these notes at december   was baa with a stable outlook by moody s investors service and bbb with a stable outlook by standard poor s 
additionally  in connection with the issuance of these notes  we entered into interest rate swaps  which were terminated in december and are further described in note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 
we used the proceeds of this offering  along with cash and the proceeds from the liquidation of marketable securities  to repay the  million term loan facility we had entered into in july in connection with the funding of our june stock repurchase tender offer 
in june  we entered into a five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which we may use for future working capital and general corporate purposes 
the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc in resulted in the elimination of their million commitment  thereby reducing the availability of the credit facility to million 
the terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants  including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and  under certain circumstances  an interest coverage ratio 
as of december   and there were no borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with applicable covenants 
working capital change as of december  compared in millions  except percentages to current assets current liabilities working capital 
table of contents we define working capital as current assets less current liabilities 
the increase in working capital primarily reflects the overall reduction of current liabilities by million primarily driven by a million reduction in balances attributable to taxes payable 
the change in total current assets was negligible as increases in net receivable balances  inventory and other current assets were offset by decreases in cash and marketable and loaned securities 
cash flows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital 
we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and share based compensation charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to was primarily driven by change in other liabilities and taxes payable  primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of million  primarily resulting from increased earnings and the settlement of various audits in  the million upfront payment made to acorda on july  and the payment of certain accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the increase in cash from operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to higher earnings net of a higher investment in working capital and the proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap 
investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in collateral received under our securities lending program offset primarily by a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities and a reduction in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the decline in purchases of property  plant and equipment is primarily attributable to our hiller d  denmark manufacturing facility and certain other manufacturing upgrades which are near completion 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to is primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities  offset by cash proceeds from collateral received under securities lending 
in  significant cash flows related to investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of marketable securities of million 
our other primary use of cash in investing activities consisted of the purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
in  significant cash flows related to investing activities consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million and net purchases of property  plant and equipment totaling million 

table of contents in  net proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million were used to partially fund our tender offer 
purchases of property  plant and equipment totaled million in payments made for acquisitions and collaborations were million in  which primarily related to our acquisition of syntonix for million and our collaboration payments to cardiokine for million and neurimmune of million 
the change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities 
additionally  in we sold our position in a strategic investment for million 
financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities in compared to is due  principally  to the repayment of our term loan facility of  million in  offset by the issuance of our notes payable  a decrease in the amount of stock options exercised  and a decrease in obligations under our securities lending program 
the increase in cash used in financing activities in as compared to is due principally to a reduction in the net proceeds received from borrowings offset by an overall decrease in the amount of common stock repurchased 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares for million under our and share repurchase programs 
the primary use of cash in was for the repayment of our term loan facility of  million and the repurchase of our common stock for million  offset in part by the net proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt and proceeds of million from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs 
in  the primary use of cash related to the repurchase of our common stock for  million by means of a tender offer 
this repurchase was partially funded with cash proceeds from a short term note of  million 
additionally  cash proceeds from the issuance of shares under our share based compensation programs were million  which was attributable to the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
the change in balance of collateral received under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing activities 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations excluding funding commitments  contingent milestone payments and other off balance sheet arrangements as described below as of december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than to to after in millions total year years years years non cancellable operating leases notes payable and line of credit purchase obligations defined benefit obligation contractual obligations includes fifteen year lease on a  square foot office building in weston  massachusetts  which will serve as the future location of our general and administrative offices with a planned occupancy around mid year the initial lease term is from through under which the total minimum lease payments are million 
notes payable and line of credit includes principal and interest payments 

table of contents purchase obligations include our obligations of approximately million pursuant to a dedicated resource agreement whereby a laboratory will provide us with dedicated services through  million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts due in less than one year  approximately million related to fixed obligations for the purchase of natural gas and million in construction commitments related to our manufacturing facility in hiller d  denmark 
the table above excludes tax payments totaling approximately million to be made in the first half of related to the settlement of certain federal and state tax audits in  and also excludes liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
as of december   we have approximately million of long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
funding commitments as of december   we have funding commitments of up to approximately million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds 
as of december   we have several ongoing clinical trials 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations cros 
the contracts with cros are generally cancellable  with notice  at our option 
we have recorded accrued expenses of million on our consolidated balance sheet for work done by cros as of december  we have approximately million in cancellable future commitments based on existing cro contracts as of december  which are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are cancellable 
contingent milestone payments based on our development plans as of december   we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately  million as part of our various collaborations  including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
we anticipate that we may pay approximately million of milestone payments in  provided various developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved 
amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory approval and commercial milestones 
these milestones may not be achieved 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we consolidate entities if we are the primary beneficiary 
legal matters please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of legal matters as of december  critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances  marketable 
table of contents securities  derivatives and hedging activities  inventory  impairments of long lived assets including intangible assets  impairments of goodwill  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  valuation of investments  research and development expenses  contingencies and litigation  and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  collaborative relationships  clinical trial expenses  consolidation of variable interest entities  inventory  investments  impairment of financial instruments  impairment of long lived assets including goodwill  valuation of acquired intangible assets and ipr d  share based compensation  income taxes  and contingencies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery 
however  sales of tysabri in the us are recognized on the sell through model  that is  upon shipment of the product by elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to elan 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
reserves for discounts and allowances revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  va rebates  managed care rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances 
our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
royalty revenues we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products 
there are no future performance obligations on our part 
table of contents under these license agreements 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues  we record such revenues on a cash basis 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in october a new accounting standard for the recognition of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables was issued 
this standard provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  while we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  this standard may impact us in the event we complete future transactions or modify existing collaborative relationships 
refer to note  new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this standard and its impact on us 
collaborative relationships effective january   we adopted a newly issued accounting standard for the accounting and disclosure of an entity s collaborative arrangements 
this newly issued standard prescribes that certain transactions between collaborators be recorded in the income statement on either a gross or net basis  depending on the characteristics of the collaboration relationship 
in accordance with this guidance  we must also evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity 
amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to our operations 
for collaborations with commercialized products  if we are the principal we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income 
if we are not the principal  we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue 
the revenue recognition topic of the codification describes the principal as the party who is responsible for delivering the product or service to the customer  has latitude to determine price  and has the risks and rewards of providing product or service to the customer  including inventory and credit risk 
as discussed within note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
for such consolidated entities where we own less than a interest  we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  we consider a number of factors  including determining the expected losses and residual returns of the technologies being developed pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of such collaborations 

table of contents discounted cash flow models are typically used in these analyses and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to assuming that the research and development efforts will result in an approved commercial product  estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting timing of regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding from partners resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
these factors affect the way we account for certain collaborations 
future events may result in our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we have a collaborative arrangement 
the consolidation of variable interest entities may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operation in future periods 
effective january   a new accounting standard will amend previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities and will affect how an enterprise determines whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this new standard may affect how we account for the consolidation of common structures  such as joint ventures  equity method investments  collaboration and other agreements and purchase arrangements 
under this revised guidance  the determination about whether an enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity is required to be evaluated continuously 
refer to note  new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this standard and its impact on us 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
capitalization of inventory costs our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process  including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
we expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 

table of contents obsolescence and unmarketable inventory we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
in the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration  we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value 
investments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes  government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested  equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies  some of which have collaborative agreements with us  equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available  and investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds where fair value is not readily available 
these investments are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we monitor the financial performance of our portfolio of investments which are subject to concentration limits set within our investment policy to help mitigate and limit the amount of investment exposure as to institution  maturity and investment type 
the objectives of this policy are safety of principal  liquidity and yield 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
as noted in note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as level these assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets 
we also have some investments classified as level whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies 
we apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents impairment of financial instruments other than temporary impairments in april  we implemented newly issued accounting standards which provide guidance for the recognition  measurement and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this newly issued standard amended the other than temporary impairment model for debt securities and requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of credit losses and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired 
the impairment model for equity securities was not affected 
prior to our adoption of these new accounting standards in april  we recognized all other than temporary impairment amounts related to our debt securities in earnings as required under the previously effective guidance which required that management assert that it had the ability and intent to hold a debt security until maturity or until we recovered the cost of our investment 
under the new accounting standards  an other than temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
however  even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security  expected cash flows to be received must be evaluated to determine if a credit loss has occurred 
in the event of a credit loss  only the amount associated with the credit loss is recognized in income 
the amount of losses relating to other factors  including those resulting from changes in interest rates  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
evaluating investments for other than temporary impairments we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  as required under the investment for debt and equity securities topic of the codification 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  and the financial condition of the issuer 
we then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
impairment of long lived assets including goodwill long lived assets other than goodwill we periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including property plant and equipment  as well as intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could indicate a change in circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  
table of contents a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change or development in strategy or operations that negatively impact the utilization of our long lived assets  a significant change in industry or economic trends  significant underperformance of the asset in relation to historical or projected future operating results  if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  including its eventual residual value  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets  other than goodwill  during  and goodwill we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
the provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we calculate the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing both an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model with multiple scenarios for future growth 
the discount is calculated based on our cost of capital rate 
the market approach utilizes revenue and other metrics from similar publicly traded companies 
the results of both fair value calculations are then compared to our reporting unit s carrying value 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
in each year  the fair value of our reporting unit  which includes goodwill  was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit 
the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions used in calculating fair value include identifying future cash flows  which requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
valuation of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets 
table of contents acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
we account for business combinations completed on or after january  in accordance with the revised guidance for accounting for business combinations  which modifies the criteria that must be met to qualify as a business combination and prescribes new accounting requirements  including the accounting treatment associated with acquired ipr d 
before january  we measured acquired ipr d at fair value and expensed it on the acquisition date  or capitalized it as intangible assets if certain criteria were met 
effective january   acquired ipr d is measured at fair value and capitalized as intangible assets and tested for impairment until completion of programs and amortized from the date of completion over its estimated useful life 
share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
in connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
in addition  for our performance vested restricted stock programs  we estimate the performance factor each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned 
for example  performance vested restricted stock programs are usually based on company performance metrics such as annual revenue and earnings per share 
thus  during the performance period  we estimate our full year revenue and earnings per share and then adjust the performance factor after the completion of the full year 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
new forms of equity awards are expected to be granted to certain employees beginning in restricted stock units which will vest based on market conditions and performance vested restricted stock units which will be settled in cash 
the market based awards require the use of a binomial model or monte carlo simulation for valuation at grant date and include key assumptions such as the expected market price of the company s stock on the vest date and the expected number of vested shares 
the cash settled awards will be marked to market at each period end with fluctuations in value reported through earnings 
we will apply forfeiture rate assumptions similar to those utilized by us when accounting for our other share based compensation programs 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences 
table of contents result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
these revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations in canada  brazil  argentina  australia  new zealand  japan  china  and india and throughout europe in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri and in germany in connection with the sale of fumaderm 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily with respect to the euro  danish kroner  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
the majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions 
table of contents denominated in foreign currencies 
we also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items 
we have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items 
the following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs 
as of december  and  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions 
certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
as of december  and  a basis point adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million in each period 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
as of december  and  we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
we regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
