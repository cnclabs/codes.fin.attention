table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
critical success factors critical success factors include our ability to access capital on acceptable terms  accurately forecast consumer loan performance  and maintain or grow consumer loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate 
access to capital our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to maintain consistent financial performance  maintain modest financial leverage  and maintain multiple funding sources 
our funded debt to equity ratio is at december  we currently utilize the following forms of debt financing a revolving secured line of credit with a commercial bank syndicate  revolving secured warehouse facilities with institutional investors  asset backed secured financings with qualified institutional investors  and senior secured notes due consumer loan performance at the time the consumer loan is submitted to us for assignment  we forecast future expected cash flows from the consumer loan 
based on these forecasts  an advance or one time payment is made to the related dealer partner at a price designed to achieve an acceptable return on capital 
if consumer loan performance equals or exceeds our original expectation  it is likely our target return on capital will be achieved 
we use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each consumer loan at the time of assignment 
we continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each consumer loan subsequent to assignment 
our evaluation becomes more accurate as the consumer loans age  as we use actual performance data in our forecast 
by comparing our current expected collection rate for each consumer loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment  we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast 
the following table compares our forecast of consumer loan collection rates as of december   with the forecasts as of december   as of december   and at the time of assignment  segmented by year of assignment consumer loan forecasted collection percentage as of variance in forecasted collection percentage from assignment december  december  december  initial december  december  initial year forecast forecast as a result of current economic conditions and uncertainty about future conditions  our forecasts of future collection rates are subject to a greater than normal degree of risk 
our pricing strategy considers this in that we have established advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  even if collection rates are less than we currently forecast 
during  our forecasted collection rates declined as payment patterns were worse than historical payment patterns for consumer loans with similar attributes 
during the latter part of  we adjusted the expected collection rate of new consumer loan assignments downward to reflect this unfavorable trend in consumer loan performance 
during  payment patterns improved for consumer loans assigned during both and the improvement in payment patterns  together with our reduced expectations  have caused our forecasted collection rates to exceed our initial forecast for consumer loans assigned during and 
table of contents the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates includes amounts paid to acquire purchased loans  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of december  payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included in the advance percentage paid to the dealer partner 
all amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
the table includes both dealer loans and purchased loans 
as of december  consumer loan forecasted of forecast assignment year collection advance spread realized the risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the consumer loans age 
for and prior consumer loan assignments  the risk of a material forecast variance is modest  as we have currently realized in excess of of the expected collections 
conversely  the forecasted collection rate for   and consumer loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates includes amounts paid to acquire purchased loans  and the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate as of december  for purchased loans and dealer loans separately consumer loan forecasted assignment year collection advance spread purchased loans dealer loans although the advance rate on purchased loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on dealer loans  purchased loans do not require us to pay dealer holdback 
the increase in the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate during and occurred as a result of pricing changes implemented during the first nine months of and improving forecasted collection rates during the positive impact of these two factors on the spread for was partially offset by pricing changes implemented during the last four months of 
table of contents consumer loan volume our ability to maintain and grow consumer loan volume is impacted by our pricing strategy  the number of dealer partners actively participating in our programs  and the competitive environment 
the following table summarizes changes in consumer loan dollar and unit volume in each of the last quarters as compared with the same period in the previous year consumer loans year over year percent change three months ended dollar volume unit volume march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  dollar and unit volume declined during the first three quarters of as compared to the same periods in due to pricing changes implemented during the first nine months of the growth in dollar and unit volume during the fourth quarter of was the result of pricing changes implemented during the last four months of that reduced per unit profitability in exchange for increased loan volume 
as a result of our success in renewing our debt facilities during the third quarter of and securing additional financing during the fourth quarter of and february  we are now in position to grow year over year unit volumes 
we will continue to monitor unit volumes and will make additional pricing changes with an objective to maximize economic profit given the capital we have available 
future growth rates will depend on how unit volumes respond to pricing changes  which will be influenced to a large degree by how quickly competition returns to our market 
unit volume for the two months ended february  increased by as compared to the same period in

previously  earnings on vehicle service contracts  excluding our commissions  were recorded as other income and realized when profit sharing payments were received from third party administrators 
the following table shows the after tax earnings from vsc re and profit sharing payments received and recorded as other income for the years ended december  and years ended december  dollars in thousands premiums earned less premium tax and provision for claims after tax earnings from profit sharing payments after tax the financial results from vsc re for the year ended december  include million of after tax earnings related to a revision in our timing used to recognize premiums earned 
during the third quarter of  we revised our timing in order to better match the timing of our revenue recognition with our expected costs of servicing our vehicle service contracts  which is based on our historical claims experience 
finance charges 
for the year ended december   finance charges increased million  or  as compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio resulting from pricing changes implemented during the first nine months of  partially offset by pricing changes implemented during the fourth quarter of  and an increase in forecasted collection rates during for the years ended december  and  the average yield on our loan portfolio was and  respectively 
an increase in the average loans receivable balance due to growth of in new loan dollar volume during  partially offset by a decline in new loan dollar volume during premiums earned and provision for claims 
for the year ended december   premiums earned and provision for claims increased million and million  respectively  as compared to the increases were the result of our formation of vsc re during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we formed vsc re in order to enhance our control over and the security in the trust assets that are used to pay future vehicle service contract claims 
prior to october   vsc re reinsured vehicle service contracts that were underwritten by two of our three third party insurers 
effective october   we terminated our arrangement with one of our three third party insurers 
vsc re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by one of our two third party insurers 
premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on historical claims experience 
a provision for claims is recognized in the period the claims are incurred 
the amount of income we earn from the vehicle service contracts over time is not expected to be impacted by the formation of vsc re  as both before and after the formation  the income we recognize  excluding our commissions  is based on the amount by which vehicle service contract premiums exceed claims 
however  the formation of vsc re impacts the timing of income recognition and the income statement presentation 
prior to the formation of vsc re  our agreements with vehicle service contract tpas allowed us to receive profit sharing payments depending upon the performance of the vehicle service contract programs 
profit sharing payments were received periodically  primarily during the first quarter of each year  and were recognized on a net basis premiums earned less claims incurred as other income in the period received 
premiums earned for the year ended december  include million of revenue related to a revision in our revenue recognition timing 
we revised our revenue recognition timing in order to better match the timing with our expected costs of servicing those contracts 
other income 
for the year ended december   other income decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the formation of vsc re  as discussed above  which eliminated the profit sharing arrangements related to vehicle service contracts  except for vehicle service contracts written prior to through one of the tpas 
for the year ended december   we earned million related to vehicle service contract profit sharing payments compared to million for the same period in decreased interest income on restricted cash related to the secured financings due to a decrease in interest rates earned on cash investments relating to secured financing transactions and a decrease in the average outstanding balance 
for the year ended december   we earned million in interest income related to secured financings compared to million for the same period in decreased gap profit sharing payments resulting from an increase in gap claims paid as a percentage of premiums written 
for the year ended december   we received million in gap profit sharing payments compared to million for the same period in salaries and wages 
for the year ended december   salaries and wages expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million in salaries and wages related to information technology 
an increased percentage of loan underwriting costs being deferred due to an increase in dealer loan unit volume as a percentage of total unit volume 
for dealer loans  certain underwriting costs are considered dealer loan origination costs and are deferred and expensed over the life of the dealer loan as an adjustment to finance charge revenue while  for purchased loans  all underwriting costs are expensed immediately 
since dealer loans represent a larger proportion of total unit volume during as compared to the same period in prior year  the deferral was higher for the year ended december   as compared to deferring the same proportion of underwriting costs during the year ended december  would have increased salaries and wages by approximately million  partially offset by an increase of million related to stock based compensation primarily due to the grant of restricted stock awards during general and administrative 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased million  or  as compared to primarily resulting from increased legal costs and expenses related to the ongoing examination by the internal revenue service 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower sales commissions reflecting a decrease of in consumer loan unit volume for the year ended december  and the discontinuance of certain dealer partner support programs and lower utilization of various other dealer partner programs 
provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was the result of an improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio 
during the 
table of contents year ended december   forecasted collection rates increased on previously impaired loan pools and as a result  a portion of this increase was recognized as a reversal of previously recorded provision for credit losses 
during the second quarter of  as a result of lower than expected realized collection rates  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio  which resulted in a provision for credit losses of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by an additional million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we revised the estimated timing of future collections to reflect reduced prepayment expectations as a result of recent trends 
the fourth quarter of forecast modifications resulted in a provision for credit losses of million

interest 
for the year ended december   interest expense decreased million  or  as compared to the following table shows interest expense  the average outstanding debt balance and the pre tax average cost of debt for the years ended december  and years ended december  dollars in thousands interest expense average outstanding debt balance pre tax average cost of debt for the year ended december   the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the average outstanding debt balance and a reduction in our pre tax average cost of debt due to reductions in market rates 
the reductions in market rates were slightly offset by less favorable pricing on our revolving credit facilities 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate decreased to  from in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded during the third and fourth quarters of year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table highlights changes for the year ended december   as compared to year ended december  average outstanding balance of loan portfolio finance charges premiums earned  net of provision for claims operating expenses provision for credit losses interest expense income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased for the year ended december  primarily due to the following increased finance charges due primarily to an increase in the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on our loan portfolio  and increased premiums earned  net of provision for claims  due to the formation of vsc re during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents these increases were partially offset by increased provision for credit losses resulting from reductions in forecasted collection rates during the second and fourth quarters of increased interest expense due to an increase in the average outstanding debt balance partially offset by a reduction in our pre tax average cost of debt  and increased operating expenses primarily related to salaries and wages 
finance charges 
for the year ended december   finance charges increased million  or  as compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio due to an increase in the number of active dealer partners partially offset by a reduction in volume per active dealer partner  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on our loan portfolio primarily due to declining loan performance partially offset by more attractive pricing on originations 
for the years ended december  and  the average yield on our loan portfolio was and  respectively 
premiums earned and provision for claims 
for the year ended december   premiums earned and provision for claims increased million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we formed vsc re in order to enhance our control and the security of the trust assets that are used to pay future vehicle service contract claims 
during  vsc re reinsured vehicle service contracts that were underwritten by two of our three third party insurers 
our financial results for the year ended december  reflect two months of vsc re activity  including million in premiums earned and million in provision for claims 
other income 
for the year ended december   other income increased million  or  as compared to the increase was primarily the result of increased periodic vehicle service contract and gap profit sharing payments received during the year from third party vehicle service contract and guaranteed asset protection providers 
since we had only received these payments since  the amounts of these payments were not estimable due to a lack of historical information 
as a result  the revenue related to these payments was recognized in the period the payments were received 
for the year ended december  we received a total of million in vehicle service contract and gap profit sharing payments compared to million in payments received in salaries and wages 
for the year ended december   salaries and wages expense increased million  or  as compared to the increase was primarily a result of an increase of million related to our support functions 
this increase was primarily related to increases in information technology  analytics  and finance to support current and expected future growth 
an increase of million related to our servicing functions primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio 
an increase of million related to our originations functions due to a decreased percentage of loan underwriting costs being deferred due to a decrease in dealer loan unit volume as a percentage of total unit volume 
for dealer loans  certain underwriting costs are considered dealer loan origination costs and are deferred and expensed over the life of the dealer loan as an adjustment to finance charge revenue while  for purchased loans  all underwriting costs are expensed immediately 
since dealer loans represent a smaller proportion of total unit volume during as compared to the same period in prior year  the deferral was smaller for the year ended december   as compared to deferring the same proportion of underwriting costs during the year ended december  would have decreased salaries and wages by approximately million 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the discontinuance of certain dealer partner support programs  lower utilization of various other dealer partner programs  and the elimination of our national dealer partner convention during these decreases were offset by an increase in sales commissions reflecting an increase of in consumer loan unit volume for the year ended december  provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses increased million  or  as compared to the increase was primarily due to reductions in our forecasted collection rates during the second and fourth quarters of as a result of lower than expected realized collection rates during these periods 
during the second quarter of  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio  which resulted in a provision for credit losses of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by an additional million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we revised the estimated timing of future collections to reflect declining trends in consumer loan prepayments

provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate increased to  from in the same period of the increase was primarily due to a decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded in critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment  and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
finance charge revenue allowance for credit losses balance sheet captions loans receivable allowance for credit losses income statement captions finance charges provision for credit losses nature of estimates required estimating the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments 
assumptions and approaches used for accounting purposes  we are not considered to be an originator of consumer loans  but instead are considered to be a lender to our dealer partners for consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program  and a purchaser of consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
as a result of this classification  our accounting policies for recognizing finance charge revenue and determining our allowance for credit losses may be different from other lenders in our market  who  based on their different business models  may be considered to be a direct lender to consumers for accounting purposes 
for additional information regarding our classification as a lender to our dealer partners for accounting purposes  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
for 
table of contents dealer loans  finance charge revenue and the allowance for credit losses are calculated after first aggregating dealer loans outstanding for each dealer partner 
for the same purpose  purchased loans are aggregated according to the month the loan was purchased 
an allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net asset value loan balance less the allowance to the value of forecasted future cash flows discounted at the yield established at the inception of the loan origination date for a dealer loan or purchase date for a purchased loan 
the discounted value of future cash flows is comprised of estimated future collections on the loans  less any estimated dealer holdback payments related to dealer loans 
we write off loans once there are no forecasted future collections on any of the associated consumer loans 
cash flows from any individual dealer loan or pool of purchased loans are often different than estimated cash flows at loan inception 
if such difference is favorable  the difference is recognized prospectively into income over the remaining life of the dealer loan or pool of purchased loans through a yield adjustment 
if such difference is unfavorable  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
because differences between estimated cash flows at inception and actual cash flows occur often  an allowance is required for a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
an allowance for credit losses does not necessarily indicate that a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans is unprofitable  and in recent years  very seldom are cash flows from a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans insufficient to repay the initial amounts advanced or paid to the dealer partner 
future collections on dealer and purchased loans are forecasted based on the historical performance of consumer loans with similar characteristics  adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns 
dealer holdback is forecasted based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each dealer loan 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a new methodology for forecasting future collections on consumer loans 
the new methodology increased the dollar amount of overall forecasted collections by 
while the new methodology produces overall collection rates that are very similar to those produced by the prior methodology  the new methodology utilizes a more sophisticated approach which allows us to expand the number of variables on which the forecast is based 
as a result  we believe the new forecast improves the precision of our estimates in two respects i the new forecast is believed to be more accurate when applied to a smaller group of consumer loans  which allows us to forecast more accurately at the dealer pool level and more precisely measure the performance of specific segments of our portfolio and ii the new forecast is believed to be more sensitive to changes in consumer loan performance and will allow us to react more quickly to changes in consumer loan performance 
implementation of the new methodology resulted in a reversal of million in provision for credit losses as higher forecasted collections reduced the amount of loan impairment 
in conjunction with our implementation of the new forecasting methodology  we reevaluated our forecast of future collections on old  fully reserved dealer loans 
as a result  we wrote off million of dealer loans and the related allowance for credit losses as we were no longer forecasting any future collections on these dealer loans 
this write off had no impact on net income for the first quarter of as all of these dealer loans were fully reserved 
our forecast of future collections prior to the second quarter of assumed that consumer loans within our current portfolio would produce similar collection rates as produced by historical consumer loans with the same attributes 
during the second quarter of  we modified our forecast to assume that consumer loans assigned during  and would perform to basis points lower than historical consumer loans with the same attributes 
as a result  we reduced our estimate of future cash flows by million  or of the total 
table of contents undiscounted cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio 
of the total reduction  million was recorded as provision for credit losses during the second quarter of we did not modify our forecast related to and prior consumer loans as these consumer loans continued to perform as expected 
during the fourth quarter of  we again realized lower than expected collection rates and as a result implemented an additional modification to our forecasting methodology 
this modification reduced estimated future net cash flows by million  or of the total undiscounted cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio 
the adjustment impacted only consumer loans assigned during the fourth quarter of and during forecasted collection rates on consumer loans assigned on or before september  were not modified as collection results during the fourth quarter of were consistent with our expectations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we revised the estimated timing of future collections to reflect declining trends in consumer loan prepayments 
during  we experienced a reduction in prepayments  which typically result from payoffs that occur when consumers reestablish a positive credit history  trade in their vehicle  and finance another vehicle purchase with a more traditional auto loan 
as the availability of traditional financing was curtailed during this period as a result of economic conditions  prepayment rates had declined 
as a result of these forecast modifications  we recognized a provision for credit losses of million during the fourth quarter of key factors variances in the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods 
a decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on loans at december  would have reduced net income by approximately million

assumptions and approaches used premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience 
in developing our cost expectations  we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term  as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past 
we will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate  including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence  and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified 
premiums earned for the year ended december  include million of revenue related to a revision in our revenue recognition timing 
we revised our revenue recognition timing during the third quarter of in order to better match the timing with our expected costs of servicing those contracts

assumptions and approaches used we follow a two step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions 
first  we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  for positions that we determine are more likely than not to be sustained  we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being sustained 
we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or more information becomes available 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we need capital to fund new loans and pay dealer holdback 
our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  collections of consumer loans and borrowings under a revolving secured line of credit with a commercial bank syndicate  revolving secured warehouse facilities with institutional investors  asset backed secured financings with qualified institutional investors  and senior secured notes due there are various restrictive debt covenants for each financing arrangement and we are in compliance with those covenants as of december  for information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a million asset backed secured financing  and on february   we issued million of senior notes 
the net proceeds from these financings were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our million secured warehouse facility 
after these repayments  we have over million in available borrowing capacity 
our first priority is to ensure we have the available capacity to fund expected new consumer loan assignments 
while the successful completion of these financings will improve our position in that regard  we intend to continue to work to secure additional borrowing capacity  increase the diversity of our funding sources  and extend the term of one or more of our revolving credit facility and our revolving secured warehouse facilities
