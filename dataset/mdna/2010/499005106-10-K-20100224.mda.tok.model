consolidated revenues in increased million  or from  while consolidated expenses increased million or from consolidated pre tax earnings from continuing operations in decreased million  or from the changes in our pre tax earnings loss from continuing operations by segment from to are summarized as follows equities our pre tax earnings from equities decreased in by million  or  from the decrease is primarily due to increased transaction costs principally driven by higher share volume  lower revenue capture  increased regulatory transaction fees and additional costs in associated with increased compensation due to additional headcount and our investments in businesses and infrastructure  both domestically and internationally 
these factors were partially offset by higher equity volumes 
ficc our pre tax earnings from ficc increased in by million  or  from the increase is primarily due to higher earnings from knight libertas  which was acquired during the third quarter of offset  in part  by additional costs in associated with our investments in businesses and infrastructure  both domestically and internationally 
corporate our pre tax loss from our corporate segment increased in by million from  primarily due to the million gain from the partial sale of our equity interest in direct edge in offset  in part  by a million reversal of a lease loss accrual in certain factors affecting results of operations we may experience significant variation in our future results of operations 
these fluctuations may result from numerous factors 
these factors include  among other things  introductions of or 
table of contents enhancements to trade execution services by us or our competitors  the value of our securities positions and other financial instruments and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our trade execution activities  the dollar value of securities traded  the composition and profile of our order flow  volatility in the equities and ficc markets  our market share with institutional and broker dealer clients  the performance and size of  and volatility in  our quantitative market making and program trading portfolios  the performance of our high velocity algorithmic principal trading models  the performance of our international operations  costs associated with our international expansion and domestic growth  our ability to manage personnel  compensation  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses under our office leases and expenses and charges relating to legal and regulatory proceedings  the strength of our client relationships  changes in payments for order flow  changes to execution quality and changes in clearing  execution and regulatory transaction costs  the addition or loss of executive management  sales  electronic and voice trading and technology professionals  legislative  legal and regulatory changes  legal and regulatory matters  geopolitical risk  the amount  timing and cost to build out our self clearing initiative and other capital expenditures  acquisitions and divestitures  the integration  performance and operation of acquired businesses  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition  and market and economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation  increases in our market share  growth and profitability in our equities or ficc segments 
if demand for our services declines due to any of the above factors  and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to continue the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past or that we will be able to improve our operating results 
trends global economic trends our businesses are affected by many factors in the global financial markets and worldwide economic conditions 
these factors include the growth level of gross domestic product in the us  europe and asia  and the existence of transparent  efficient and liquid equity and debt markets and level of trading volumes 
global economic conditions generally improved during volatility levels across equity markets declined and credit spreads tightened during the year 
despite the slight improvements in economic conditions  there were still concerns about the outlook for global growth  inflation and declining asset values 
trends affecting our company we believe that our businesses are affected by the aforementioned global economic trends as well as more specific trends 
some of the specific trends that impact our operations  financial condition and results of operations are broker dealer clients continue to focus on statistics measuring the quality of equity executions including speed of execution and price improvement 
in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations and the extent of price improvement 
the greater focus on 
table of contents execution quality has resulted in greater competition in the marketplace  which  along with market structure changes and market conditions  has negatively impacted the revenue capture metrics of the company and other market making firms 
equities and ficc transaction volumes executed by broker dealers have fluctuated over the past few years due to retail and institutional investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors  resulting in a shift of product mix 
equities and ficc transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
over the past several years several exchanges have entered into joint ventures with broker dealers to create their own alternative trading systems ats and electronic communication networks ecn and compete within the otc and listed trading venues 
in addition  there are many new entrants into the market  including ats  multilateral trading facilities  dark liquidity pools  high frequency trading firms  and market making firms competing for retail and institutional order flow 
further  many broker dealers are offering their own internal crossing networks 
these factors continue to create further fragmentation and competition in the marketplace 
market structure changes  competition and market conditions have triggered an industry shift toward market makers charging explicit commissions or commission equivalents to institutional clients for executions in otc securities 
for the majority of our institutional client orders  we charge explicit fees in the form of commissions or commission equivalents 
institutional commission rates have fallen in the past few years due to competitive forces and increased electronic trading  and may continue to fall in the future 
market structure changes  competition and technology advancements have also led to a dramatic increase in electronic message traffic 
these increases in message traffic place heavy strains on the technology resources  bandwidth and capacities of market participants 
due to regulatory scrutiny over the past several years relating to equity sell side research and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  more institutional clients allocate commissions to broker dealers based on the quality of executions 
in the past  a good deal of institutional equity commissions were allocated to broker dealers in exchange for either research or soft dollar and commission recapture programs 
there has been continued scrutiny of the capital markets industry by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or new or modified regulations and rules could occur in the future and could materially impact the company s revenues and profitability 
members of congress have raised various concerns about the regulatory structure of the us capital markets and have asked the sec to take a close look at the regulatory structure and make the changes necessary to insure the rule framework governing the us capital markets is comprehensive and complete 
the sec has stated that it will carefully review  and propose rules where necessary  a variety of marketplace trading issues including  but not limited to high frequency trading  indications of interest  various forms of off exchange trading  dark liquidity pools  post trade attribution  co location  and sponsored access 
in addition  the sec recently filed proposed rules dealing with short sales and flash orders which have not been finalized and are currently subject to public comment 
the short sale proposals could make it more difficult for market makers to sell stock short 
any legislative or regulatory action  including  but not limited to  new laws  rules or regulations in these or other areas could  depending on their form and scope  adversely impact trading volumes and profitability 
there continues to be growth in equity electronic trading  as evidenced by increased volumes in direct market access platforms  algorithmic and program trading  high frequency trading and ecns and dark liquidity pools 
in addition  electronic trading continues to expand to other asset classes  including options  currencies and fixed income 
the expansion of electronic trading may result in the growth of innovative electronic products and competition for order flow 

table of contents the macro economic environment and market conditions have had an adverse impact on the profitability of the institutional customer base  resulting in volatile earnings and decreased volumes 
during  there have been increased volumes in lower priced stocks  driven by the decline in overall stock prices 
as market volume  in general  is not predictable  an increase in retail volume in stocks with lower share prices may decrease the profit potential of trading these shares  while  at the same time  increase trade or share based transaction costs  thus lowering overall profitability

we had approximately million shares of class a common stock outstanding as of december  our us registered broker dealers are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and require the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c these regulations also prohibit a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to its parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec and finra prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to its parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions  which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of its excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
we believe that during  all of our broker dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital adequacy requirements 
in connection with an ongoing regulatory examination of one of our broker dealer subsidiaries  an issue has been identified as to whether a cash balance had been maintained in an acceptable control location within a bank  and therefore whether such balance should be considered an allowable asset in determining net capital of the broker dealer 
several of our broker dealer subsidiaries maintained balances in similar accounts at the bank 
due to the uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of the examiner s findings  we have closed the accounts in question and moved the cash balances to a more commonly used control location 
in the event that finra and or the sec conclude that such balances are deemed to be non allowable assets  three of our broker dealer subsidiaries may be considered to have had inadequate regulatory capital at december  due to this administrative matter 
while it may be determined that the affected broker dealers were in technical violation at december   the capital existed within the affected broker dealers at that time and has subsequently been transferred to a more commonly used control location

effects of inflation because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation may affect our expenses  such as employee compensation  office leasing costs and communications expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of the services offered us

discontinued operations our former asset management segment comprised deephaven capital management llc and its subsidiaries collectively  deephaven  which was formerly the registered investment adviser to  and sponsor of  the deephaven investment funds the deephaven funds 
prior to february   deephaven was a wholly owned subsidiary 
on february    we contributed our interest in deephaven to deephaven capital management holdings llc deephaven holdings in exchange for a interest in deephaven holdings 
certain deephaven managers deephaven managers acquired a interest in deephaven holdings in exchange for the termination of their employment agreements and associated profit sharing bonuses and an equity contribution 
on january   deephaven entered into an asset purchase agreement along with deephaven managing partners  llc deephaven partners  the company  and each of the deephaven managers to sell substantially all of deephaven s assets to stark roth  inc together with its affiliates  stark with stark agreeing to assume certain limited liabilities of deephaven 
on march   deephaven completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to stark 
as of that date  deephaven was replaced by stark as the investment manager  managing member and general partner for the deephaven funds and we exited the asset management business 
as a result of this sale  our asset management segment was classified as a discontinued operation 

table of contents consideration for the sale is based on a formulaic purchase price based on the extent of deephaven global multi strategy fund gms fund assets that investors elect to have stark manage on an ongoing basis  and the investment return of such transferred assets over a two year period following the closing of the transaction

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate 
however  if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally knight direct  hotspot  knight bondpoint and knight libertas  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we determine the values and useful lives of intangible assets upon acquisition 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
we test goodwill and the useful lives of intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that signifies the existence of impairment 
goodwill goodwill of million at december  is related to our equities and ficc segments 
goodwill primarily represents purchases of the businesses now operating as knight direct in our equities segment and hotspot  knight bondpoint and knight libertas in our ficc segment 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair value of each segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each segment observable price to book multiples and discounted cash flow analyses and we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
as part of our test for impairment  we also consider the profitability of the applicable reporting unit as well as the overall market value of the company  compared to the company s book value 
we performed our annual test for impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired at that time 
we believe there was no impairment of our goodwill at december  
table of contents intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their respective lives 
intangible assets  less accumulated amortization  of million at december  are all attributable to our equities and ficc segments 
substantially all intangible assets resulted from the purchases of the businesses now operating as knight direct  hotspot  knight bondpoint and knight libertas 
we amortize these assets  which primarily consist of customer relationships on a straight line basis over their useful lives  the majority of which have been determined to range from four to years 
we performed our annual test for impairment of intangible assets with definitive lives in the second quarter of we test amortizable intangibles for recoverability whenever events indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of  we discontinued the use of the donaldson trade name 
as such  we wrote off million in intangible assets related to the trade name 
during  we discontinued the use of the direct trading institutional trade name and wrote off the remaining book value of million 
no other events occurred in or that would indicate that the carrying amounts of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable  and we do not believe that our intangible assets were impaired as of december  financial instruments and fair value we value our financial instruments using a hierarchy of fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period for financial instruments that are carried at fair value 
our securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased will generally be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or broker or dealer quotations with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active  but are valued based on quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   our investment in deephaven funds  as well as deferred compensation investments met the definition of level certain instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency 
for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as of december   we did not hold any financial instruments that met the definition of level 
table of contents strategic investments strategic investments include noncontrolling equity ownership interests held by us within our non broker dealer subsidiaries  primarily in financial services related businesses 
we account for strategic investments under the equity method  at cost or at fair value 
we use the equity method of accounting for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that are held by us within our non broker dealer subsidiaries 
our non broker dealers carry investments in corporations at adjusted cost 
we use the equity method of accounting where we are considered to exert significant influence on the investee 
we hold investments at adjusted cost when we are not considered to exert significant influence on the investee 
we account for investments in liquid investment funds  including deferred compensation investments in mutual funds  at fair value 
we review strategic investments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the carrying values of the investments have not been impaired 
if we assess that an impairment loss on a strategic investment has occurred due to a decline in fair value or other market conditions  we write the investment down to its estimated impaired value 
lease loss accrual it is our policy to identify excess real estate capacity and where applicable  accrue for related future costs  net of estimated sublease income 
in determining the accrual  we perform a nominal cash flow analysis for lease losses initiated prior to december  and we accrue costs related to the excess capacity 
for lease losses initiated after december   our policy is to accrue future costs related to excess capacity using a discounted cash flow analysis 
in  we incurred a charge of million  primarily related to the lease loss accrual on a portion of the jc lease encompassing approximately  square feet  all of which was unoccupied at the time 
during  we entered into two sublease agreements related to our jc lease for a portion of the premises for which we had previously recorded a lease loss accrual 
as a result  we adjusted the lease loss accrual based on the difference between the actual terms of the subleases and the assumptions used in the previous calculation of the lease loss accrual and recorded a lease loss benefit of million 
in  we recorded a net benefit of million primarily related to the jc lease 
the accrual on the remaining unoccupied space of approximately  square feet was derived from assumptions and estimates based on lease terms of an anticipated additional sub lease agreement  which assumed a sublease would commence in the beginning of  anticipated market prices along the jersey city waterfront and estimated up front costs  including broker fees and build out allowances 
in  we recorded a benefit of million primarily related to a reversal of a previously recognized lease loss with respect to the jc lease 
we had previously considered a portion of these premises to be excess real estate and had therefore recorded a lease loss accrual for such excess office space 
based on expected growth and future needs  in the second quarter of we made the decision to build out and occupy the excess office space and therefore recorded a benefit related to the reversal of such previously recorded lease loss 
market making  trading and sales activities securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased  which primarily consist of listed and otc equities  are carried at fair value and are recorded on a trade date basis 
net trading revenue trading gains  net of trading losses and commissions which includes commission equivalents earned on institutional client orders and related expenses are also recorded on a trade date basis 
our third party clearing agreements call for payment or receipt of interest income  net of transaction related interest charged by clearing brokers for facilitating the settlement and financing of securities transactions 

table of contents dividend income relating to securities owned and dividend expense relating to securities sold  not yet purchased  derived from our market making activities are included as a component of net trading revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
other estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates that we make in connection with accounting for the items noted above  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
when determining stock based employee compensation expense  we make certain estimates and assumptions relating to volatility and forfeiture rates 
we estimate volatility based on several factors including implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock on the grant date and the historical volatility of our common stock 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on historical rates of forfeiture of employee stock awards 
a portion of our employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of operations represents discretionary bonuses  which are accrued for throughout the year and paid after the end of the year 
among many factors  discretionary bonus accruals are generally influenced by our overall performance and competitive industry compensation levels 
we estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the acquisition date fair value for all identifiable assets acquired  and liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies requires the capitalization of in process research and development and requires the expensing of acquisition related and restructuring costs as incurred 
this new accounting standard was effective as of january  and we will apply the provisions of this statement to any future business combinations 
in march  the fasb issued an accounting standard which requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
this statement was effective as of january  the adoption only affected disclosures within the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an accounting standard which establishes accounting and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  the accounting standard sets forth i the period after the 
table of contents balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  ii the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and iii the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
in addition  the accounting standard requires a reporting entity to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated 
this new accounting standard was effective for reporting periods ended after june  and the adoption did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on july   the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification became the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb for nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap to the company 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues take force abstracts  instead the fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
the issuance of the codification does not change gaap and was effective for reporting periods ending after september  the implementation of the codification did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
since july   no accounting standards updates were issued that are expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business  see part i  item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k 
market risk our market making and trading activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility and changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
for working capital purposes  we invest in money market funds and government securities or maintain interest bearing balances at banks and in our trading accounts with clearing brokers  which are classified as cash and cash equivalents and receivable from brokers and dealers  respectively  on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these financial instruments do not have maturity dates or present a material market risk  as the balances are short term in nature and subject to daily repricing 
our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies are subject to the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations 
these balances are monitored daily and are not material to our overall cash position 
in our equities segment where we maintain securities positions  we employ proprietary position management and trading systems that provide real time  on line position management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by reviewing trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management and an independent risk control function on a real time basis as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals  capital allocations  and real time profits and losses 
our management of trading positions is enhanced by our review of mark to market valuations and position summaries on a daily basis 
in the normal course of business  we maintain inventories of exchange listed and otc equity securities  and to a significantly lesser extent  listed equity options and fixed income products 
the fair 
table of contents value of these securities at december  and was million and million  respectively  in long positions and million and million  respectively  in short positions 
the potential change in fair value  using a hypothetical decline in prices  is estimated to be a loss of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to the offset of gains in short positions with the losses in long positions 
the following table illustrates  for the period indicated  our average  highest and lowest month end inventory at market value based on both the aggregate and the net of the long and short positions of trading securities in millions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions average month end highest month end lowest month end operational risk operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising  for example  from major systems failures 
we incur operational risk across all of our business activities  including revenue generating activities as well as support functions 
legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under legal risk 
primary responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with our operating segments and supporting functions 
our operating segments maintain controls designed to manage and mitigate operational risk for existing activities 
as new products and business activities are developed  we identify operational risks and design controls to mitigate the identified risks 
disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities related to our primary operations and resources and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
we have also established policies  procedures and technologies to protect our systems and other assets from unauthorized access 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards 
legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business see government regulation and market structure in part i  item 
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
we have also established procedures that are designed to require that our policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices are followed
