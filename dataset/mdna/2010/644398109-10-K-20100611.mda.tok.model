executive overview overview we are a leader in transactional television and the distribution of general motion picture entertainment 
our key customers include large cable and satellite operators  premium movie channel providers and major hollywood studios 
we distribute content world wide 
our three principal businesses are reflected in the transactional tv  film production and direct to consumer operating segments 
our transactional tv segment distributes adult content to cable and satellite operators who then distribute the content to retail customers via ppv and vod technology 
we earn revenue through contractual percentage splits of the retail price 
the transactional tv segment has historically been our most profitable segment 
the film production segment primarily generates revenue through the distribution of mainstream content to large cable and satellite operators  premium movie channel providers and other international content distributors 
this segment also periodically provides contract 
table of contents film production services to major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
the film production segment incurred operating losses in fiscal years and primarily due to large non cash impairment charges 
our direct to consumer segment primarily generates revenue from membership fees earned through the distribution of adult content to consumer websites 
the direct to consumer segment has historically incurred operating losses and is expected to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  however  we have focused our efforts on returning the segment to profitability through efforts described below 
our corporate administration segment includes all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc the business models of each of our segments are summarized below 
transactional tv segment our transactional tv segment is focused on the distribution of its ppv and vod service to msos and dbs providers worldwide 
we earn a percentage of revenue  or split  from our content for each vod  ppv or subscription that is purchased on our customers platform 
revenue growth can occur when we launch our services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experience growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where our services are currently distributed  when we launch additional services or replace our competitors services on existing customer cable and dbs platforms  and when our proportional buy rates improve relative to our competitors 
alternatively  our revenue could decline if we were to experience lower consumer buy rates as has been the case with the recent general economic downturn  if customers migrate to other forms of entertainment such as pay and free adult oriented internet sites  if the revenue splits we receive from our customers decline  if additional competitive channels are added to our customers platforms or if our existing customers remove or replace our services on their platform 
prior to fiscal year  the transactional tv segment focused on growing its distribution of content in the us market 
during fiscal year  we began expanding our services into new international markets in north america  europe and latin america  and we generated approximately million of revenue from this international distribution in fiscal year we continued to focus on growing our international distribution in fiscal year and improved international revenue to million 
approximately of our fiscal year international revenue was from vod services  and the remaining proportion was from ppv services 
we leverage our existing technology infrastructure to distribute content internationally 
our international vod distribution resulted in minimal transport and sales staff costs  and our ppv channel distribution also resulted in minimal incremental costs because our existing transponder footprint reaches from north central canada to southern mexico 
as we continue to expand our international vod services distribution footprint  we expect to incur minimal costs for this distribution including transport and sales staff costs 
we expect the expansion of our international ppv channel services will require us to lease additional transponder space in order to obtain a broader international footprint for our channels 
we believe the cost of leasing additional transponder space will increase our cost of sales  however  the cost will be relatively fixed in nature and will not vary relative to increases or decreases in the related revenue 
transactional tv segment revenue during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends our domestic vod and ppv revenue declined  and we believe this is due to a reduction in consumer discretionary spending in response to the economic downturn 
we believe consumers that have historically purchased our content with discretionary income have reduced or eliminated their acquisition of our content or are viewing adult content through less expensive alternatives such as pay and free internet websites in response to the economic downturn 

table of contents in november  the largest dbs provider in the us decreased their distribution of our channels from three channels to two channels 
the customer has the right to discontinue carriage of any of the remaining two channels without penalty and with little advance notice 
the removal of the channel in november resulted in an estimated decline in our ppv revenue of between approximately million and million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to the same prior year quarter 
we expect that there will be a comparable decline in our ppv quarterly revenue in each of the first three quarters of fiscal year as compared to the same quarters in the prior fiscal year as a result of the removal of the third channel 
partially offsetting the decline in domestic revenue is incremental revenue from the expansion of our distribution into international markets 
as of march   we were distributing content to canada  latin america and europe 
we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to distribute our content to new customers internationally and increase the quantity of content we distribute to existing international customers 
we also expect to pursue distribution in new international regions in fiscal year such as asia 
our transactional tv segment domestic revenue during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year were relatively consistent with the results reported in the second quarter of fiscal year excluding the impact from the loss of a ppv channel on the largest dbs platform in the us these results may be a leading indicator of the stabilization of the domestic revenue  however  we believe additional performance data is necessary to confirm this stabilization 
it is reasonably possible that difficult economic conditions will persist or worsen  which could cause our transactional tv segment results to be materially adversely impacted 
our transactional tv segment is reliant on discretionary consumer purchases of our content 
when consumers spend less of their discretionary income on non essential expenses such as our content  it adversely impacts our business 
additionally  the price point of our content is significantly higher than both mainstream content and adult content that is distributed through other less expensive and free media such as the internet 
as a result  consumers that would otherwise purchase our content may opt to purchase less expensive mainstream content or obtain their adult entertainment through less expensive media such as pay and free internet 
although we believe that the deterioration in the economy has negatively impacted the transactional tv segment s results  it is not possible for us to quantify or reasonably estimate the financial impact 
we have remained focused on maintaining our competitive market position by offering a wide range of high quality content that we believe is superior to other product offerings in the industry 
we are currently in discussions with many of our largest customers to seek ways to encourage increased viewing of our content and to implement value added offers in order for our content to be more competitive with alternative media 
when considering the future operating results of the transactional tv segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact the segment s future operating results declines in new and existing customer buys of adult tv services due to a migration to other lower cost or free adult media services such as the internet  adverse impacts to our business from a continued decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions  increased pressure from customers to reduce the revenue splits we receive or execute minimum guarantees or risk having those customers remove one or more of our channels from their platform  increased vod competition from established adult entertainment companies or new entrants such as production studios and internet based distributors because the barriers of entry for this product line are low  
table of contents challenges associated with our continued expansion into international markets and our inexperience with international customers  buy rates  and consumer habits  slowing growth of the overall adult entertainment category and limited incremental distribution opportunities within the us  and continued product commoditization 
in addition to the above noted risks  our agreements typically allow our customers to make significant changes to our distribution such as reduce the number of hours on the platform or remove one or more channels from the platform and may be terminated on relatively short notice without penalty 
if one or more of our cable mso or dbs operators changes our distribution terms  terminates or does not renew our agreements  or does not renew the agreements on terms as favorable as those of our current agreements  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
all the above mentioned challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and future periods  we believe that the transactional tv segment will experience revenue growth if we can successfully manage and are not materially adversely impacted by the challenges and risks previously mentioned 
we currently expect future growth in the segment to occur if we are successful with the following objectives continuing our international distribution expansion into new and existing geographic locations  increasing the proportional vod hours we receive on existing customer platforms  replacing our competitors ppv channels with our channels on both existing and new customer platforms  transitioning cable mso and dbs providers to less edited content standards  improving the value proposition for customers such as including limited term internet access to our content for each ppv or vod purchase  improving the vod user interfaces  and increasing the advertising revenue we receive from our ppv channels 
film production segment the film production segment has historically derived the majority of its revenue from two principal businesses the production and distribution of original motion pictures such as erotic thrillers  horror movies  and erotic  event styled content owned content  and the licensing of third party films in international and domestic markets where we act as a sales agent for the product repped content 
this segment also periodically provides contract film production services to certain major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
we generate revenue by licensing our owned content for a one time fee to free tv  premium tv and other domestic and international distributors 
additionally  we leveraged our existing customer relationships with our transactional tv segment customers and license the film production segment s owned content to domestic and international cable mso and dbs providers through revenue split arrangements that are structured in a similar manner to our transactional tv segment agreements 
the revenue splits we receive from cable mso and dbs providers for the film production segment content are higher than the revenue splits we receive for our transactional tv segment content 
table of contents primarily due to the mainstream nature of the content 
however  the retail price for our mainstream content is lower than our transactional tv segment content  and our per buy revenue per transaction is often the same as the transactional tv segment 
we also generate repped revenue through sales agency arrangements whereby we earn a sales commission and marketing fees by selling mainstream titles on behalf of film producers 
the film production segment has established relationships with independent mainstream filmmakers and represents these filmmakers movies through its lightning entertainment group 
beginning in late fiscal year  we leveraged our existing transactional tv segment customer relationships and began distributing repped content on vod platforms through several domestic cable msos 
we are also distributing repped content titles to domestic retail dvd markets through a distribution partner 
our distribution of repped content to vod and retail dvd markets generated incremental sales agency commission revenue of approximately million in fiscal year  and we expect this revenue will improve in fiscal year our film production segment periodically acts as a contract film producer for major hollywood studios 
through these producer for hire arrangements  we provide services and incur costs associated with the film production 
once the film has been delivered to the customer  we earn a fee for our services 
although we maintain no ownership rights for the produced content  we are responsible for the management and oversight of the production 
we do not produce these movies unless we have an executed agreement with a customer 
these services have historically generated between million and million of revenue with a gross margin of between and 
however  our historical performance may not be representative of producer for hire performance in the future 
film production segment revenue during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends owned content revenue declined primarily due to a million decrease in revenue from premium cable channel customers related to the delivery of episodic series 
we recognized revenue in fiscal year from a premium cable channel customer for the remaining partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series  whereas in fiscal year  we recognized the full revenue from the delivery of the second installment of an episodic series as well as revenue from the initial partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series 
we completed the production of a fourth installment of an episodic series in fiscal year and expect to deliver and recognize revenue for this series during the first half of fiscal year we expect the revenue from the fourth series will be between million and million  and we expect our total production costs for the series will be million 
we also plan to continue to pursue these episodic productions in the future 
repped content revenue improved due to our distribution of mainstream content to domestic vod and retail dvd markets 
also contributing to the increase was incremental revenue from the distribution of content to home video and vod platforms through our arrangement with a mainstream film distributor 
we expect the mainstream repped content revenue will continue to improve as we expand our distribution of content to new customer vod platforms and increase the amount of content we distribute on existing customer vod platforms 
producer for hire and other revenue improved due to the completion of a producer for hire arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which generated million in revenue and a profit margin percentage of approximately 
revenue also improved due to the partial delivery of film titles associated with a second producer for hire arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the second producer for hire deal generated revenue of million and a profit margin percentage of  and we expect to recognize the remaining revenue of between approximately million and million in the first quarter of fiscal year we are also in the process of securing a new producer for hire arrangement scheduled for production in fiscal year  and we currently estimate this production will generate approximately million in additional producer for hire revenue in fiscal year and generate a profit margin of between and 

table of contents when considering the future operating results of the film production segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact this segment s operating results the identification and execution of owned content deals with premium movie channels could become less frequent  declines in new and existing customer vod buys of our erotic owned content due to a migration to other lower cost or free adult services such as the internet  increased competition to our owned content from more explicit adult film offerings  adverse impacts to our business from a continued depression or additional decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions  and we are making larger producer advances and incurring more significant costs for repped content films with larger production budgets and we may be unable to recover these advances and costs through the future sale of the films 
the impact of these challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and in future periods  we will focus on improving the revenue we generate from this segment through the following strategic initiatives generating incremental mainstream repped content revenue by distributing higher quality titles with recognized actors and actresses through domestic cable msos  generating incremental mainstream repped content revenue by distributing higher quality titles through the dvd retail market  identifying other mainstream niche content  such as horror titles  for distribution through domestic cable msos and other platforms  expanding the quantity of owned episodic series content deals we execute with premium movie channels  identifying new opportunities to provide producer for hire services to major hollywood studios  and improving the buy rates of vod owned content on cable mso and dbs platforms through the same methods utilized by our transactional tv segment 
during fiscal year  the film markets were significantly impacted by the economic downturn 
as a result  the film production segment s customers reduced their content acquisition budgets 
we believe this occurred because our customers were relying upon their existing libraries to reduce spending and costs 
these changes significantly impacted the film production segment operating results during the third quarter of fiscal year and as a result  we made material revisions to the segment s internal forecasts resulting in a million goodwill impairment charge 
we also recorded a film cost impairment charge of approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of the economic downturn 
during fiscal year  the film production segment results were consistent with our internal budgets excluding the impact of the goodwill and other impairment charges 
however  industry conditions continue to be unfavorable in the film markets where we distribute content  and we believe these challenging conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the five year internal forecast for the film production segment was revised downward in connection with our year end goodwill impairment testing resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we also recorded a film cost impairment charge of approximately million and a 
table of contents recoupable costs and producer advances impairment charge of approximately million during fiscal year associated with the unfavorable film market conditions 
it is reasonably possible that future unfavorable economic conditions could cause the operating results of this segment to remain depressed or decline 
direct to consumer segment our direct to consumer segment generates revenue primarily by selling memberships to our adult consumer websites 
during fiscal year and  we experienced a decline in the direct to consumer segment revenue which we believe is due to a decline in consumer spending as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions as well as the availability of free and low cost internet content 
we expect this segment will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  however  we recently launched additional niche consumer websites during fiscal year as well as a dating website and are optimistic that these efforts will result in improved performance during fiscal year the direct to consumer segment also operated an internet protocol television iptv set top box business beginning in late fiscal year customers of the iptv set top box product could obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we discontinued the operations of the iptv business model as a result of underperformance in fiscal year see note discontinued operations for further discussion on our discontinuation of the iptv set top box business 
corporate administration segment the corporate administration segment reflects all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal expenses  accounting expenses  human resource department costs  insurance expenses  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs  and costs associated with our public company filings and shareholder communications 
our focus for this operating segment is balancing cost containment with the need for administrative support for the growth of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments that the company uses in applying the accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that the company reports in its financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require the company to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company continuously evaluates its methods  estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and considerations used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the recognition of revenue  the recognition and measurement of income tax expenses  assets and liabilities including the measurement of uncertain tax positions and valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of recoupable costs and producer advances  
table of contents the assessment of film costs and the forecast of anticipated revenue ultimate revenue  which is used to amortize film costs  the amortization methodology and valuation of content and distribution rights  the valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  and the valuation and recognition of share based compensation 
each of these critical accounting policies is described in detail below 
revenue recognition the company s revenue consists primarily of fees earned through the distribution of its licensed and owned content through various media outlets including msos  dbs providers  the internet  premium movie channels  and other available media channels 
revenue also consists of fees earned through the licensing of third party content whereby the company acts as a sales agent for the film producer 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the services have been rendered or delivery conditions as described in the related contract for the completed film have been satisfied  the license period related to film production segment arrangements has begun and the customer can begin exploitation of the content  the fee is fixed or determinable and its collection is reasonably assured 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgment including estimating monthly revenue based on historical data and determining collectability of fees 
transactional tv segment vod and ppv services the transactional tv segment s vod and ppv revenue are recognized based on buys and monthly subscriber counts reported each month by cable msos and dbs providers 
the company earns revenue through a contractual percentage split of the retail price of the content 
the actual monthly sales information is not typically reported to the transactional tv segment until approximately days after the month of service 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the transactional tv segment s historical experience with each customer 
the revenue may be subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the monthly sales reports 
film production segment owned content licensing revenue from the licensing of owned content is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the delivery conditions of the completed film have been satisfied as required in the contract  the license period of the arrangement has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
for agreements that involve the distribution of content to the home video market  ppv market and vod market  the company is unable to determine or reasonably estimate the revenue split earned from customers in advance of receiving the reported earnings because the performance materially varies by film and from period to period 
as a result  the company s share of licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by the customers 
film production segment repped content licensing the company recognizes revenue from represented film licensing activities on a net basis as an agent 
the revenue recognized for these transactions represents only the sales agency fee earned by the company on the total content licensing fee 
the producers share of the licensing fee is recorded as a liability by the company until the balance is remitted to the producer 
for agreements that involve the distribution of repped content to the home video market  ppv market and vod market  the company 
table of contents is unable to determine or reasonably estimate the revenue split due from customers in advance of receiving the reported earnings because the performance materially varies by film and from period to period 
as a result  the company s share of licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by the customers 
the agreements entered into with the producers may also provide for a marketing fee that can be earned by the company 
the marketing fee is stated as a fixed amount and is contractually earned by the company upon collection of sufficient film licensing fees as defined by the contract  the terms of which vary depending on film quality  distribution markets and other factors 
the company recognizes marketing fees as revenue when the amounts become determinable and the collection of the fee is reasonably assured  which typically occurs in the period of sufficient collection of licensing fees as defined by the respective contract 
direct to consumer segment membership fees revenue from membership fees is recognized over the life of the membership 
the company records an allowance for refunds based on expected membership cancellations  credits and chargebacks 
income taxes the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining its income tax provision expense 
these estimates and judgments are used in the determination of tax credits  benefits and deductions  uncertain tax positions  and the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which are a result of differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the company also uses estimates and judgments in determining interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates could result in a material change to the company s tax provision in subsequent periods 
the company is required to evaluate the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if the company s evaluation determines that the recovery is unlikely  it would increase the provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets equal to the amount that is not expected to be recoverable 
the company currently has a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million to fully reserve for a deferred tax asset associated with the company s discontinued set top box operations in europe 
the company has no other deferred tax asset valuation allowances and estimates that  with the exception of the set top box european deferred tax assets  its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if these estimates were to change and the company s assessment indicated it would be unable to recover the deferred tax assets  the company would be required to increase its income tax provision expense in the period of the change in estimate 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of tax regulations 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position liabilities 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this process is based on various factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new audit activity 
changes to these factors and the company s estimates regarding these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision expense 

table of contents recoupable costs and producer advances recoupable costs and producer advances represent amounts paid by the company that are expected to be subsequently recovered through the collection of fees associated with the company s licensing of repped content 
in connection with the film production segment s repped content operations  the company enters into sales agency agreements whereby the company acts as a sales agent for a producer s film sales agency agreements 
these sales agency agreements typically include provisions whereby certain costs that are incurred for promotion related activities will be paid by the company on behalf of the producer such as movie trailer and ad material costs 
the company may also pay the producer an advance for the related film prior to the distribution of such film 
as the company subsequently licenses the producer s film and license fees are collected  the recoupable costs and producer advances are recovered by the company through these license fee collections 
license fees typically are not paid to the producer of the related film until such recoupable costs and producer advances have been fully recovered by the company 
the company evaluates recoupable costs and producer advances for impairment on a quarterly basis based on estimates of future license fee collections 
an impairment of these assets could occur if the company s estimates indicated that it would be unable to collect fees from the licensing of a film sufficient to recover the related outstanding recoupable costs and producer advances 
during each fiscal year ended march   and  the company incurred impairment charges related to recoupable costs and producer advances of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the impairment charges are recorded in the charge for restructuring and asset impairments other than goodwill line item within the consolidated statements of operations 
film costs the company capitalizes costs incurred for film production including costs to develop  acquire and produce films  which primarily consist of salaries  equipment and overhead costs  as well as the cost to acquire rights to films 
film costs include amounts for completed films and films still in development 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of the films 
interest expense associated with film costs is not capitalized because the duration of productions is short term in nature 
films are typically direct to television in nature 
film costs are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
film costs are reviewed for impairment on a title by title basis each quarterly reporting period 
the company records an impairment charge when the fair value of the title is less than the unamortized cost 
examples of events or circumstances that could result in an impairment charge for film costs include a an unexpected less favorable performance of a film title or event on a mso platform or b a downward adjustment in the estimated future performance of a film title or event due to an adverse change to the general business climate as was experienced during the third quarter of fiscal year future adjustments associated with film cost valuations could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations in future periods 
capitalized film costs are recognized as an expense within cost of sales using the film forecast method 
under this method  capitalized film costs are expensed based on the proportion of the film s revenue recognized for such period relative to the film s estimated remaining ultimate revenue  not to exceed ten years 
ultimate revenue is the estimated total revenue expected to be recognized over a film s useful life 
ultimate revenue for new film titles and events is typically estimated using actual historical performance of comparable films that are similar in nature such as production cost and genre 
film revenue associated with this method includes amounts from all sources on an individual film forecast computation method 
estimates of ultimate revenue are reviewed quarterly and adjusted if appropriate  and amortization is also adjusted on a prospective basis for such a change in estimate 
changes in estimated ultimate revenue could be due to a variety of factors  including the 
table of contents proportional buy rates of the content as compared to competitive content as well as the level of market acceptance of the television product 
content and distribution rights the transactional tv segments content library primarily consists of licensed films 
the company capitalizes the costs associated with the licenses as well as certain editing and production costs and amortizes these capitalized costs on a straight line basis over the term of the licensing agreement generally years 
these costs should be amortized using a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the related film revenue is expected to be recognized 
the company amortizes the cost of content and distribution rights on a straight line basis because each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenue and the revenue for the films is expected to be recognized ratably over the related license term 
the company regularly reviews and evaluates the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis as opposed to an alternative method of amortization such as an accelerated basis 
based on these analyses  the company has determined that the amortization of the film library costs using a straight line basis most accurately reflects the manner in which the revenue for the related films will be recognized 
the company periodically reviews the content library and assesses whether the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the library based on expected forecast results 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  the company will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets the company records goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the operating segment level on an annual basis march for the company and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using considerations of various valuation methodologies which could include income and market valuation approaches 
the income approach involves discounting the reporting unit s projected free cash flow at its weighted average cost of capital  and the market approach considers comparable publicly traded company valuations and recent merger and acquisition valuations 
the analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth  determination of the weighted average cost of capital  and other similar estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
the company allocates goodwill to each operating segment based on the operating segment expected to benefit from the related acquisition and or combination 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting segments and consolidated company  a reconciliation of the fair value estimates for the reporting segments to the company s market capitalization was performed as of march  the reconciliation considered a reasonable control premium based on merger and acquisition transactions within the media and entertainment industry and other available information 
a control premium is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 

table of contents other identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization primarily include amounts paid to acquire non compete agreements with certain key executives  contractual and non contractual customer relationships  intellectual property rights  patents and websites 
these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which is typically five years 
intangible asset balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts in the period in which they become fully amortized or impaired and are no longer in use 
the company continually reviews long lived assets that are held and used and identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  the company considers whether the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets is less than the related assets carrying value and if so  the company records an impairment loss for the excess recorded carrying value of the asset as compared to its fair value 
employee equity incentive plans the company has an employee equity incentive plan  which is described more fully in note employee equity incentive plans 
employee equity awards are accounted for under the fair value method 
accordingly  the company measures share based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the company uses the straight line attribution method to recognize the fair value of the award over the related service period 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted

table of contents results of operations transactional tv segment the following table sets forth certain financial information for the transactional tv segment for each of the three fiscal years presented amounts may not sum due to rounding in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs net revenue vod ppv other revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit operating expenses operating income net revenue vod the decline in vod revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to a reduction in revenue from several of the largest cable msos in the us we believe the decline is due to a reduction in discretionary consumer spending in response to the economic downturn 
we believe consumers that have historically purchased our content with discretionary income have reduced or eliminated their acquisition of our content or are viewing adult content through less expensive or free alternatives such as pay and free internet websites in response to the economic downturn 
the decline in revenue was also due to a settlement of paid and unpaid historical amounts with a domestic mso customer in fiscal year that resulted in million of additional revenue as further discussed below  and no similar settlement occurred in fiscal year partially offsetting the decline in revenue was a a million increase in revenue primarily associated with new international vod distribution  b a million increase in domestic vod revenue associated with distribution to a new cable mso customer in the eastern us  and c a million increase in revenue from domestic telecommunication companies associated with their growth in subscribers 
revenue increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a a million increase in revenue from the largest mso in the us due to our improved content performance and from a related increase in the quantity of content available on the platform  b an increase in revenue from performance improvement on several of the other top ten largest cable msos in the us related to new content packages and recommended changes to our customers menu positioning  and c million of incremental international revenue 
the fiscal year results also included approximately million in additional revenue associated with settling paid and unpaid historical amounts with a domestic mso customer 
based on a joint research analysis with the mso customer  we entered into an arrangement and agreed that any historical billings and payments were resolved resulting in the completion of the earning process and settlement of the million in revenue 
we also made recommendations to the related mso regarding process changes to prevent similar future issues  and we believe the issues that gave rise to the adjustment are isolated to the related mso 
the increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decline in revenue from the second largest 
table of contents cable mso in the us because the operator increased the retail price of content during fiscal year and since the economic downturn  we believe consumers are less willing to purchase content at the higher retail price 
ppv revenue from our ppv distribution declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the two largest dbs providers and other top ten cable msos in the us  which we believe to be primarily associated with the general economic downturn and related reduction in discretionary consumer spending 
revenue also declined by approximately million due to our loss of a third channel on the largest dbs provider in the us  which is discussed in more detail below 
the decline in revenue was partially offset by a million increase in revenue associated with our international expansion into markets primarily in latin america 
in november  the largest dbs provider in the us decreased their distribution of our channels from three channels to two channels 
the customer has the right to discontinue carriage of any of the remaining two channels without penalty and with little advance notice 
the removal of the channel in november resulted in an estimated decline in our ppv revenue of between million and million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which was the first full quarter impact of the removal of the third channel 
we expect that there will be a materially comparable decline in our ppv quarterly revenue in each of the first three quarters of fiscal year as compared to the same quarters in the prior fiscal year as a result of the removal of the third channel 
the decline in ppv revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million reduction in revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us due to an increase in the number of competitors on the platform and a reduction in consumer spending related to the economic downturn 
also contributing to the decline was lower revenue from several of the other top ten largest cable msos in the us due to the economic downturn 
we believe consumers that historically purchased our content with discretionary income reduced or eliminated their acquisition of our content or are viewing adult content through less expensive or free alternatives such as the internet in response to the economic downturn 
partially offsetting the revenue decline was an increase in revenue of approximately million from the addition of a new channel on the largest dbs platform in the us other revenue other revenue primarily includes revenue from advertising on our ppv channels and from content distribution services 
other revenue in fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year the decline in other revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was from lower c band revenue because we ceased offering these services during the third quarter of fiscal year we did not incur any material costs associated with removing this service offering 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast center  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisitions  vod transport  amortization of content  depreciation of equipment  and related employee costs 
cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million increase in transport costs to support the increase in vod distribution  b a million increase in transponder and uplink costs to support additional ppv channel offerings  and c a million increase in content and distribution amortization expense associated with licensing higher quality content to attract additional consumer purchases 

table of contents cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a a million increase in transport costs to support the increase in us vod distribution  b a million increase in transponder costs to support additional ppv channel offerings  and c a million increase in content and distribution amortization expense associated with licensing higher quality content to attract additional customer purchases 
the increase in cost of sales was partially offset by a million decline in costs related to the termination of the c band services and a reduction in employee expenses from cost reduction efforts 
operating expenses and operating income operating expenses increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million increase in consulting fees primarily associated with new business development  and b a million increase in advertising and promotion costs incurred in an effort to improve domestic revenue 
operating income for fiscal year was million as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to higher advertising and promotion costs of approximately million which were incurred in connection with efforts to increase domestic revenue 
this increase in costs was partially offset by a million reduction in expenses associated with equipment and tenant improvement disposition and impairment charges that were incurred in the prior fiscal year but did not recur in fiscal year operating income for the fiscal years and was million and million  respectively

these items are discussed in more detail below 
represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
net revenue owned content owned content revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million decline in revenue from premium cable channel customers related to the delivery of episodic series 
we recognized revenue in fiscal year from a premium cable channel customer for the remaining partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series  whereas in fiscal year  we recognized the full revenue from the delivery of the second installment of an episodic series as well as revenue from the initial partial delivery of the third installment of an episodic series 
we also completed the production of a fourth installment of an episodic series in fiscal year and expect to deliver and recognize revenue of between million and million for this series during the first half of fiscal year  and we expect our total production costs for this series will be approximately million 
also contributing to the decline in revenue in fiscal year was lower revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us because fewer owned content titles were distributed on that platform in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the revenue decline in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to a a million decline in revenue from a large ppv aggregator that no longer distributes our content  b a million decline in revenue from the largest dbs provider in the us because our content was moved to a more competitive location within that provider s electronic programming guide  c a million decline in certain horror film revenue generated through an arrangement with a mainstream film distributor due to less favorable film performance  and d a general decline in revenue believed to be due to unfavorable economic conditions in the film markets during the second half of fiscal year we believe the unfavorable economic conditions caused potential customers to reduce or eliminate acquisitions of our content in an effort to reduce spending which resulted in the execution of fewer owned content deals 
the decline in owned content revenue was partially offset by a million increase in revenue from new vod distribution on us cable platforms 
repped content repped content revenue includes revenue from the licensing of film titles that we represent but do not own under domestic and international sales agency relationships with various film producers 
the increase in revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a a million increase in revenue from the new distribution of repped content on domestic vod platforms and through retail dvd markets  and b a million increase in revenue from the distribution of content to home video and vod platforms through our arrangements with mainstream film distributors 
we also believe that our ability to represent and distribute mainstream film titles with widely recognized actors and actresses has contributed to the improvement in repped content revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decline in repped content revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was believed to be due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on the independent film market consistent with the conditions described above within the owned content revenue discussion 

table of contents producer for hire and other revenue producer for hire and other revenue relates to amounts earned through producer for hire arrangements  music royalty fees and the delivery of other miscellaneous film materials to distributors 
approximately million of the increase in revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to our completion of a producer for hire arrangement with a major hollywood studio in fiscal year we also recognized approximately million of revenue associated with the initial delivery of films from a second producer for hire arrangement 
we expect to recognize between approximately million and million of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year associated with the remaining delivery of films from the second producer for hire arrangement 
producer for hire and other revenue declined in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year because we did not generate revenue from a producer for hire arrangement during fiscal year whereas in fiscal year  we recognized approximately million of revenue from a producer for hire arrangement 
cost of sales our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the amortization of our owned content film costs as well as delivery and distribution costs related to that content 
these expenses also include the costs we incur to provide producer for hire services 
there is no significant cost of sales related to the repped content services 
cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to million of producer for hire costs associated with the completion of a producer for hire arrangement and the partial delivery of films related to a second producer for hire arrangement 
the increase in costs was partially offset by a decline in film cost amortization consistent with the decline in owned content revenue 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue during fiscal year was as compared to during fiscal year film cost amortization as a percentage of owned content revenue has increased because the prior year periods included a larger proportion of revenue from older titles whose film costs had been fully amortized 
the decline in cost of sales during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a a million decline in costs related to a producer for hire deal that occurred during the prior fiscal year but no similar producer for hire deals recurred during fiscal year  and b a decline in film cost amortization related to the decline in owned content revenue 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue during fiscal years and was and  respectively 
operating expenses and operating income loss operating expenses declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily because the fiscal year results included a million non cash goodwill impairment charge and a million non cash film cost impairment charge whereas the fiscal year results included a million non cash goodwill impairment charge and a million non cash film cost impairment charge 
these impairment charges are discussed in additional detail below 
operating expenses in fiscal year also included approximately million of recoupable costs and producer advances impairment charges because we do not believe the amounts can be recovered through future sales of the related repped content 
operating expenses declined in fiscal year by approximately million due to a reduction in tradeshow and travel costs associated with efforts to further reduce expenses in response to the economic downturn 
operating loss for fiscal year was million as compared to million in fiscal year 
table of contents operating expenses increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a a million non cash goodwill impairment charge  and b a million non cash impairment charge for certain owned content film costs 
the prior fiscal year operating expense results included a million non cash film cost impairment charge which was partially offset by the reversal of million in net earn out accrual expenses that had been previously accrued but were reversed because the former principals of mrg did not achieve the required performance targets 
the film production segment s operating loss was million for fiscal year as compared to operating income of million for fiscal year goodwill impairment charge throughout fiscal year  the company did not identify any indications of goodwill impairment within the film production segment  and the results of the segment in fiscal year were consistent with the company s internal forecast excluding the goodwill and other impairment charges 
as part of our year end procedures  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of march  we engaged an independent firm to assist us in performing the impairment test 
the income and market valuation approaches were considered in determining the estimated fair value of the film production segment 
using these methods  we determined that the estimated fair value of the film production segment was less than its carrying value as of march  we then performed additional analysis to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
we determined the implied fair value of the goodwill by first allocating the estimated fair value of the film production segment to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the operating segment 
the excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million to reduce the film production segment s goodwill from million to the implied fair value of goodwill of zero 
although the fiscal year performance of the film production segment was consistent with our internal forecasts excluding the impact of impairment charges  conditions within the film markets continue to be challenging 
based on our historical and current experience within the film production markets and in connection with our year end annual goodwill impairment test  we modified our five year forecast for the film production segment downward to reflect our estimate that film market conditions will remain depressed and decline further 
as a result of our downward adjustment to the five year forecast  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year see additional discussion at the fiscal year goodwill impairment testing section below 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we determined that continued adverse changes in the business climate and material revisions to the film production segment s internal three year forecasts based on lower than expected revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year were events that could indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
we therefore engaged an independent firm to assist us in performing an impairment test 
the income and market valuation approaches were considered in determining the estimated fair value of the film production segment 
using these methods  we determined that the estimated fair value of the film production segment was less than its carrying value at december  we then performed additional analysis to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal year of million to reduce the film production segment s goodwill from million to the implied fair value of goodwill of million 
film cost impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment expense of approximately million associated with several film production segment owned content films and events 
as part of our quarterly film performance analysis and in connection with our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we estimated that conditions within the film markets would continue to be 
table of contents challenging and adjusted downward the film production segment s forecasts as well as certain estimated future film and event performance 
as a result of the downward adjustment to certain estimated future film and event performance  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the related films and events 
this difference was recorded as an asset impairment charge within the film production segment s operating expenses 
the fair value of the films and events was estimated by discounting the film or event s projected cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment expense of approximately million associated with several film production segment owned content films and events 
during that quarter and as part of our process to continually assess the expected performance of owned content  we determined that downward adjustments to the estimated performance of the films and events should be recorded as a result of adverse changes to the business climate as discussed above 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the films and events 
this difference was recorded as an asset impairment charge within the film production segment s operating expenses 
the fair value of the films and events was estimated by discounting the film or event s projected cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment expense of approximately million associated with several film production segment owned content films and events 
the films and events were originally valued when we acquired the film production segment in during the quarter ended december   we obtained initial revenue data that indicated the actual performance of the films and events would not meet the original estimates that were established when we acquired the film production segment 
as a result  we lowered our estimate of the expected future benefits to be derived from these films and events and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the films and events 
the fair value of the films and events was estimated by discounting the film or event s projected cash flow by the weighted average cost of capital

net membership revenue during fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year other revenue other revenue primarily relates to the sale of content to other webmasters and wireless platforms 
other revenue in fiscal year was generally consistent with fiscal year we believe other revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of the general economic downturn and a related reduction in spending by our customers 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of expenses associated with credit card processing  bandwidth  traffic acquisition  content amortization  depreciation of equipment  and related employee costs 
the increase in cost of sales during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to additional employee costs incurred in an effort to improve our website membership revenue 
cost of sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was relatively flat 
operating expenses and operating income loss operating expenses declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of a million reduction in website maintenance fees 
operating expenses were also lower because the fiscal year results included a million settlement expense associated with a vendor and no similar expenses were incurred in fiscal year the decline in operating expenses was partially offset by a million intangible asset impairment charge discussed in further detail below 
the direct to consumer segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year operating expenses in fiscal year were relatively flat as compared to fiscal year  and the direct to consumer segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to operating income of million in fiscal year intangible assets impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that certain internally developed websites and related software used to manage our consumer websites no longer met our quality standards 
additionally  the software did not provide sufficient support or functionality for content management  database interface  consumer facing websites  or accumulation or reporting of website traffic 
as a result  we ceased using the websites and software  and we determined the websites and software would not provide us with service potential in the future 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the fair value of the websites and related software to zero 

table of contents corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for the corporate administration segment for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs operating expenses expenses related to the corporate administration segment include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal expenses  accounting expenses  human resource department costs  insurance expenses  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs  and costs associated with our public company filings and shareholder communications 
our focus for this operating segment is balancing cost containment with the need for administrative support for the growth of the company 
corporate administration expenses declined in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a a million decline in audit  accounting and related third party advisor fees from ongoing cost reduction efforts  b a million decline in external legal fees  and c a million decline in tradeshow and travel costs 
operating expenses also declined as a result of our efforts to renegotiate our contracts with vendors in order to obtain more favorable fee structures 
corporate administration expenses were lower in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million decline in employee costs primarily related to a reduction in executive bonus accruals and from lower legal and human resource costs of million related to organizational improvements 
the reduction in costs was partially offset by an increase in third party advisor fees of approximately million and higher stock option expenses from grants that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year fiscal year goodwill impairment testing goodwill impairment testing requires us to use judgment in determining assumptions for the analysis 
we performed annual goodwill impairment tests for the transactional tv and film production segments at march  the market and income valuation approaches were considered in determining the estimated fair value of the segments 
the market valuation approach requires us to estimate and consider market multiples for companies considered to be comparable to ours 
there is a lack of comparable public companies to consider for the market valuation approach  however  we believe the comparable companies considered are reasonably similar to our operations 
the income valuation approach requires us to consider the projected operating results and cash flows of the segments discounted by a risk adjusted discount rate 
the projected results include estimates of revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  content acquisitions  capital expenditures and other related cash flows and activities over a five year future period 
for the transactional tv segment  the market valuation approach was more heavily weighted than the income approach because a the overall company valuation is believed to be primarily based on the performance and results of the transactional tv segment  and b the results of the transactional tv segment represent the large majority of the company s overall activity 
for the film production segment  the valuation methodologies were weighted equally 
the company assumed an average annual growth decline rate of and for the transactional tv and film production segments  respectively  based on both company specific and general economic risk 
the company used a weighted average cost of capital of and for the 
table of contents risk adjusted discount rates for the transactional tv and film production segments  respectively 
the weighted average cost of capital was determined by considering comparable companies and their cost of equity  cost of debt  capital structure and other specific risk factors 
the fair value of the transactional tv segment exceeded the carrying value by approximately  and the fair value of the film production segment was less than the carrying value by approximately 
a change in the growth rate would cause the percentage by which the transactional tv segment s fair value exceeded the carrying value to change by approximately basis points  and the percentage by which the film production segment s fair value was less than the carrying value to change by approximately basis points 
a change in the weighted average cost of capital would cause the percentage by which the transactional tv segment s fair value exceeded the carrying value to change by approximately basis points  and the percentage by which the film production segment s fair value was less than the carrying value to change by approximately basis points 
due to the continued pressure on the company s stock price during fiscal year  the company s market capitalization was less than its shareholders equity balance at march  as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting segments and consolidated company  a reconciliation of the fair value estimates for the reporting segments to the company s market capitalization was also performed as of march  the reconciliation reflected an implied control premium of  which is reflective of historical merger and acquisition transactions involving comparable companies as well as other relevant information 
based on the reconciliation  the company s fair value was in excess of its shareholders equity balance by approximately and there was no indicator of additional goodwill impairment 
a change in the control premium would cause the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the shareholders equity balance to change by approximately basis points 
other income expense and provision for income taxes other income expense the following table sets forth certain financial information for other income expense for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs other income expense represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
amounts included in other income expense primarily relate to interest expense on our line of credit borrowings  interest expense on our uncertain tax positions  and interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the change in other income expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily because the fiscal year results included the reversal of approximately million of interest expense associated with the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
there was no similar reversal of interest expense during fiscal year also contributing to the change was an increase in interest expense in fiscal year associated with an outstanding line of credit balance throughout the fiscal year 
we had no outstanding line of credit balance until the third quarter of fiscal year the decline in other income expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decline in interest income associated with a decline in investments balances as well as interest rates as compared to fiscal year the investments were redeemed and used to pay 
table of contents dividends and repurchase stock in fiscal year also contributing to the decline was an increase in interest expense associated with an outstanding line of credit balance during the second half of fiscal year provision for income taxes during fiscal year  we performed a research and development tax credit study 
the study considered fiscal years for which amended or current tax returns could be filed 
we concluded that we were eligible for research and development tax credits that would result in a reduction in the provision for income tax expense for the noted fiscal years as follows in thousands march  total approximately  and  of research and development tax credits during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
we filed amended and current tax returns during the third quarter of fiscal year for each of the fiscal years noted above and included the research and development tax credits identified in the study 
as a result of the filings  we recorded a reduction in the provision for income tax expense of million during the third quarter of fiscal year we also estimated that we will utilize research and development tax credits during fiscal year of between million and million 
approximately million of the estimated fiscal year tax credit was reflected in the third quarter of fiscal year and the remaining amount was reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we also recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million within our film production segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and the impairment charge was a non deductible expense for purposes of the fiscal year tax return 
no other discreet items had a material impact on our tax rate during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million within our film production segment 
the impairment charge was a non deductible expense for purposes of our fiscal year tax return 
additionally  the statute of limitations expired on approximately million of uncertain tax positions in fiscal year this reversal of uncertain tax positions resulted in a million reduction in tax expense and a million reversal of related interest expense during the third quarter of fiscal year see note income taxes within the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax provision 
discontinued operations the direct to consumer segment acquired certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box and other intangible assets in late fiscal year in an effort to expand the product lines that are delivered directly to consumers 
the intellectual property rights technology allowed us to manufacture a device through which consumers could obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
based primarily on a lower than expected subscriber additions for the iptv business model during the second half of fiscal year  b the significant downturn in economic 
table of contents conditions and related reduction in consumer spending during the second half of fiscal year  and c slower than expected development of new product lines  we restructured the direct to consumer segment operations as it relates to these new product lines 
although we continued to operate the iptv set top box business and other new direct to consumer product lines through the first nine months of fiscal year  we materially changed the nature of those operations and dedicated fewer resources towards marketing and generating revenue for the products 
based on the change in operations and an analysis of the future expected benefits  we determined that certain intangible assets associated with the related new product lines were impaired and recorded a million non cash intangible asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year additionally  several contracts were cancelled prior to the end of the related term in connection with the restructuring and as a result  we also incurred an early contract termination fee of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which was paid in april during fiscal year  the company entered into arrangements with third party affiliates to distribute the iptv set top box in europe and the us throughout fiscal year  these affiliates marketed the iptv set top box product through a variety of advertising programs including print  billboards and other miscellaneous media 
the performance of the iptv set top box business in fiscal year was lower than expected and as a result  the company implemented a plan to discontinue the operations of the iptv set top box business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  the company recorded an inventory obsolescence impairment charge of million and an equipment impairment charge of million 
the company has classified approximately million of certain equipment as held for sale based on  among other things  the company s intent and ability to sell the assets 
the assets held for sale are reflected in the prepaid and other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
we do not expect to incur material expenses or cash flows in the future associated with the discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources our current priorities for the use of our cash and cash equivalents are investments in processes intended to improve the quality and marketability of our products  funding our operating and capital requirements  and funding  from time to time  opportunities to enhance shareholder value  whether in the form of repurchase of shares of our common stock  cash dividends or other strategic transactions 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient during the next months to satisfy our operating requirements 
we also anticipate that we will be able to fund our estimated outlay for capital expenditures  repayment of outstanding debt and other related purchases that may occur during the next months through our available cash  cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from operations during that period

table of contents borrowing arrangements on december   our former line of credit matured and we obtained a new line of credit from a financial institution 
the line of credit is secured by certain trade accounts and accounts receivable  is scheduled to mature on december   and bears interest at the greater of a the current prime rate less percentage points per annum or b per annum 
the remainder of the line of credit may be drawn from time to time to support our operations and short term working capital needs  if any 
a loan origination fee of of the available line was paid upon the execution of the line of credit 
the line of credit includes a maximum borrowing base equal to the lesser of of the trade accounts and accounts receivable securing the line of credit or million  and the maximum borrowing base at march  was million 
the line of credit contains both conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing and affirmative and negative covenants customary for facilities of this type  including  without limitation  a a requirement to maintain a current asset to current liability ratio of at least to  b a requirement to maintain a total liability to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  c prohibitions on additional borrowing  lending  investing or fundamental corporate changes without prior consent  d a prohibition on declaring without consent any dividends  other than dividends payable in our stock  and e a requirement that there be no material adverse change in our current client base as it relates to our largest clients 
the line of credit provides that an event of default will exist in certain circumstances  including without limitation  our failure to make payment of principal or interest on borrowed amounts when required  failure to perform certain obligations under the line of credit and related documents  defaults in certain other indebtedness  our insolvency  a change in control  any material adverse change in our financial condition and certain other events customary for facilities of this type

commitments and contingencies contractual cash obligations the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations as of march  for each of the fiscal year time periods specified amounts may not sum due to rounding payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligations vendor obligations line of credit employment contract obligations total for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum services to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations to acquire specified quantities of movie license rights that are subject to the delivery of the related movies are included in vendor obligations because we estimate that the movies will be delivered in the specified time periods 
we maintain non cancelable leases for office space and equipment under various operating leases 
the leases for office space expire through november and contain annual consumer price index escalation clauses 
our transactional tv segment has entered into direct lease agreements that expire through december with an unrelated party for the use of transponders to broadcast its channels on satellites 
we expect to have continued access to transponders subsequent to the expiration of the 
table of contents current leases 
as the lessee of transponders under the transponder agreements  we are subject to arbitrary refusal of service by the service provider if that service provider determines that the content being transmitted by us is harmful to the service provider s name or business 
any such service disruption would substantially and adversely affect the financial position and results of operations 
we also bear the risk that the access of their networks to transponders may be restricted or denied if a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions 
additionally  cable operators may be reluctant to carry less edited or partially edited adult programming on their systems 
if either of the above scenarios occurred  it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we had no equipment under capital lease at march  or from time to time  we enter into arrangements with movie studios to acquire license rights for a fixed and or minimum quantity of movies over various purchase periods as defined by the agreements 
additionally  we are party to certain uplinking  transport and marketing services that contractually obligate us to receive services over specified terms as per these arrangements 
we are also obligated to make future payments associated with our purchase of patent rights 
these contractual obligations are reflected in the above table as vendor obligations 
we have recorded long term income taxes payable of million for uncertain tax positions  reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments  if any  related to these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  the amounts have been excluded from the above table 
uncertain tax positions we had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million at march  that are not expected to be settled within one year and have been classified within long term taxes payable 
if we were to prevail or the uncertainties were settled in our favor for all uncertain tax positions  the net effect is estimated to be a benefit to tax expense of approximately million 
as of march   we had accrued immaterial amounts of interest expense related to uncertain tax position liabilities 
there were no material changes in our unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal year during fiscal year  the statute of limitations expired on approximately million of uncertain tax positions resulting in a decline in the uncertain tax position balance as reflected in the current portion of taxes payable 
this reversal of the uncertain tax positions resulted in a million reduction in our current period tax expense and a million reversal of related interest expense 
approximately million of the reversal of the uncertain tax position liabilities was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital because the amount was originally recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital and had no impact on income tax expense 
we file us federal  state and foreign income tax returns 
during fiscal year  we concluded an audit by the internal revenue service irs for the fiscal year  and the irs proposed no changes to the fiscal year tax return in connection with the audit 
there are currently no tax audits in process with taxing authorities 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to examination of our federal and state income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements see recently issued accounting pronouncements in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies within the company s financial statements and supplementary data commencing on page f herein

a adverse change in the interest rates on borrowings under our line of credit would not have a material impact on the company s interest expense
