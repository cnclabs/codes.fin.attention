item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a developer  manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics  medical imaging systems and surgical products dedicated to the healthcare needs of women 
our core business segments are focused on breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  magnetic resonance imaging mri breast coils  computer aided detection cad for mammography and mri  minimally invasive breast biopsy devices  breast biopsy site markers  breast biopsy guidance systems  breast imaging comfort pads  and breast brachytherapy products 
we have also developed a new breast imaging platform  dimensions  which utilizes a new technology  tomosynthesis  to produce three dimensional d images  as well as conventional two dimensional d full field digital mammography ffdm images 
in the us  our dimensions product has been approved by the food and drug administration fda for providing conventional d images  and we have submitted a pre market approval pma application for the d configuration 
our dimensions d system was reviewed by the radiological devices panel of the fda on september  as part of our pma application 
in connection with that review  the panel unanimously voted that the system was both safe and effective for both screening and diagnostic mammography 
on november   we received an approvable letter from the fda for our dimensions d system 
final approval of our pma application for our system remains subject to satisfactory review and inspection of our manufacturing facility  methods and controls 
even with the approvable letter  we cannot assure that the fda will approve our system for either use on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  even if approved  the fda could impose conditions to such approval that would significantly limit the use or commercialization of the system 
our dimensions platform received ce mark approval in europe during fiscal and canadian registration in march  both for d and d modes of imaging 
in august  we acquired sentinelle medical inc sentinelle medical  a company that develops  manufactures and markets mri breast coils  patient positioners and visualization software 
sentinelle medical  which is included within our breast health segment  is dedicated to developing advanced imaging technologies used in high field strength mri systems 
our diagnostics products include the thinprep system thinprep  which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening  the rapid fetal fibronectin test  which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre term birth  and our molecular diagnostic reagents used for a wide variety of dna and rna analysis applications based on our proprietary invader chemistry 
our current clinical diagnostic offerings based upon this invader chemistry include products to assist in the diagnosis of human papillomavirus hpv  cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
we received fda approval of our cervista hpv tests in march  and ce mark approval in europe for cervista hpv high risk hr in january and in may for cervista hpv our gyn surgical products include the novasure endometrial ablation system novasure system and the adiana permanent contraception system adiana system 
the novasure system enables physicians to treat women suffering from excessive menstrual bleeding in a minimally invasive manner in order to eliminate or reduce their bleeding 
the adiana system is a form of permanent female contraception intended as an alternative to tubal ligation 
we received fda approval of the adiana system in july and ce mark approval for the system in europe in december our skeletal health products include dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  and our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging products 

table of contents recent developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
since the end of calendar  the uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and slowdown in worldwide macroeconomic conditions have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
additionally  constrictions in world credit markets have caused and continue to cause our customers to experience difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products 
economic uncertainty and unemployment have and may continue to result in cost conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness  which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered  which could adversely affect sales of our products 
if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
in march  significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposes new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices beginning in we expect that our products will fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax 
us net product sales represented and of our worldwide net product sales in fiscal and  respectively 
as we operate in a highly regulated industry  other governmental actions may adversely affect our business  operations or financial condition  including  without limitation new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to health care availability  method of delivery and payment for health care products and services  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring  labeling changes  restrictions on product distribution or use  or other measures after the introduction of our products to market  which could increase our costs of doing business  adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products  or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments  new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices  and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations  including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related therapies 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors 
recommendations  guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products 
for example  in november  the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists changed their recommendations for pap smear screening  and the united states preventive services task force changed their recommendations for mammography screening 
these new recommendations could significantly reduce the amount of screening using our thinprep  selenia and related products and adversely affect the sale of those products 
in recent history  there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the us dollar may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time 
historically  a majority of our capital 
table of contents equipment sales to international dealers have been denominated in us dollars 
however  we expect there to be a shift to more sales denominated in the euro compared to the us dollar for our euro zone dealers 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostics segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets  foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future  and if the us dollar strengthens  we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results 
acquisitions fiscal acquistions sentinelle medical inc on august   we completed our acquisition of sentinelle medical  a privately held company located in toronto  canada 
the purchase price is comprised of an million cash payment  which was net of certain adjustments  plus a two year contingent earn out up to a maximum of million in cash 
we have concluded that the acquisition of sentinelle medical did not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of sentinelle medical  which is a component of our breast health reporting segment 
we adopted accounting standards codification asc  business combinations  effective september  and have accounted for the sentinelle medical acquisition as a purchase of a business under this business combination accounting standard 
the allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of august  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets aggregating million  primarily comprised of developed technology of million and in process research and development projects of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of million 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value of in process projects based on risk adjusted cash flows utilizing a discount rate of 
these in process projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses as of the date of the acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the acquired in process research and development assets are not subject to amortization until the projects are complete  at which time  they will be amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives ranging from to years 
these projects relate to a prostrate mri coil and certain software  and the projects are expected to be completed in fiscal at a cost of approximately million 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the contingent earn out will be based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
as required by asc  we have recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the sentinelle medical business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
these cash flow projections have been discounted using a rate of 
this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability  primarily driven by assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement as defined in asc  fair value measurements 
as of september   there were no significant changes in the estimated outcomes for the contingent consideration recognized 
actual amounts paid may differ from the liability recorded 

table of contents fiscal acquisitions third wave technologies  inc on july   we completed our acquisition of third wave pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  we paid per share of third wave  for an estimated aggregate purchase price of million  including million for the estimated fair value of fully vested stock based awards and million in acquisition related expenses 
we concluded that the acquisition of third wave did not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
our results of operations include the results of third wave since the acquisition date  as a component of our diagnostics reporting segment 
our acquisition of third wave was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the total purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the excess of purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we have recorded additional amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense on the funds we borrowed to complete the acquisition in both fiscal and the allocation of the purchase price was based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of july  we finalized the allocation of the purchase price in fiscal once we had all necessary information to complete our estimates 
the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
as part of the purchase price allocation  million of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development represents programs for which some research and development has been completed  but technological feasibility has not been determined or fda approval is pending 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to these projects using a discount rate of 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value attributable to these in process projects was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the most significant acquired in process technology related to the cervista hpv hr screening  for which we estimated a value of million 
at the time of  and subsequent to the acquisition  we sold hpv reagents that detect certain high risk hpv types as analyte specific reagents asrs 
in  third wave began clinical trials for pma submissions to the fda for cervista hpv hr 
third wave submitted the pmas in april and received fda approval in the second quarter of fiscal since receiving fda approval  we have begun to transition to only selling hpv ivds 
the hpv in process research and development related only to the hpv ivds and the hpv asrs were valued as developed technology 
the estimated cost to complete third wave s remaining in process research and development projects as of september  in the aggregate was approximately million 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders and borrowed million under that facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
we paid off amounts outstanding under this amended and restated credit agreement in fiscal and terminated this agreement in third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents cytyc corporation on october   we completed our merger with cytyc  pursuant to which cytyc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cytyc shareholders received shares of our common stock and in cash for each share of cytyc common stock held by them 
the aggregate consideration we paid for cytyc  including liabilities assumed in connection with the transaction  was billion comprised as follows merger consideration paid to the former cytyc stockholders of billion  consisting of approximately billion in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately billion  million of fully vested stock options issued upon conversion of cytyc stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately million  the assumption of obligations of cytyc under its senior convertible notes due with a principal amount outstanding as of october  of approximately million and an estimated fair value of approximately million  and direct acquisition costs of million 
in connection with the merger  we entered into a credit agreement relating to a senior secured credit facility with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders  in which the lenders committed to provide  in the aggregate  senior secured financing of up to approximately billion to pay for the cash portion of the merger consideration  for repayment of existing debt of cytyc  for expenses relating to the merger and for working capital following the completion of the merger 
as of the closing of the merger  we borrowed billion under the credit facility 
in december  we refinanced a substantial portion of this credit facility through the issuance of convertible senior notes due in the principal amount of billion 
on july   after having paid off all outstanding term loans under the credit facility  we amended and restated the credit facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
our merger with cytyc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and we were considered to be the acquirer of cytyc for accounting purposes 
our results of operations after completion of the merger include the operations of cytyc 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an in process research and development of million in the first quarter of fiscal we allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of their estimated fair values 
we then allocated the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation  we determined that cytyc s identifiable intangible assets included existing technology  customer relationships and trade names 
cytyc s existing technology related to patents  patent applications and know how with respect to the technologies embedded in its currently marketed products 
in determining the allocation of the purchase price to existing technology  consideration was only given to patent and patent applications that relate to products that have been approved by the fda 
cytyc s customer relationship assets relate to relationships that cytyc s sales force has developed with ob gyns  breast surgeons  clinical laboratories and other physicians 
the trade names related to both the cytyc name as well as key product names 

table of contents we used the income approach to value the existing technology and marketing based intangibles 
this approach calculates fair value by discounting the after tax cash flows back to a present value 
the baseline data for this analysis was the cash flow estimates used to price the transaction 
cash flows were forecasted for each intangible asset  and then discounted based on an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model as well as cytyc s weighted average cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired assets  we considered asc  intangible goodwill and other  subsection  which lists the pertinent factors to be considered when estimating the useful life of an intangible asset 
these factors included a review of the expected use by the combined company of the assets acquired  the expected useful life of another asset or group of assets related to the acquired assets  legal  regulatory or other contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of an acquired asset or may enable the extension of the useful life of an acquired asset without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives either using a method that is based on estimated future cash flows as we believe this will approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be utilized  or on a straightline basis if those cash flows are not reliably determinable 
in connection with our review of long lived assets  we recorded a million intangible asset impairment charge related to our mammosite reporting unit  which was acquired in the merger with cytyc and is within our breast health segment  in the fourth quarter of fiscal see the critical accounting policies below for additional information pertaining to the impairment analysis 
acquired in process research and development as part of the purchase price allocation for our merger with cytyc  we allocated million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the merger 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value attributable to these in process projects was expensed at the time of the merger 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the fair value assigned to acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the transaction model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates were based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 
the acquired in process research and development of cytyc related to the following research and development projects adiana system and expanded labeling of the novasure system  gestiva  the thinprep imaging system  the thinprep processor and helica 

table of contents the most significant acquired in process technology related to the adiana system for which we estimated a value of approximately million 
the system is an incisionless trans cervical permanent sterilization device intended to be used during an office or hospital based procedure 
in january  the fda requested an additional year of clinical trial data for the product  and in july  we received fda approval for the product 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our rights to gestiva  a drug being developed to be used in the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth  to k v pharmaceutical company kv for a total purchase price of million 
we subsequently amended the agreement with kv to increase the purchase price to million 
for additional information  refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we had allocated million to acquired in process research for this product as part of the initial purchase price allocation 
subsequent to the merger with cytyc  we decided to discontinue the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product 
we will not incur any further costs or realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal the other in process research and development projects we acquired in our merger with cytyc were at different stages of development  ranging from the early stages of development to phase iib prototype building  ongoing clinical trials and submission to the fda of pma and drug applications 
fda approval or clearance had not been granted for any of the products classified as in process research and development  nor had cytyc received any foreign approvals or clearances for any of these products 
all products classified as in process research and development require various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda before these future products can be marketed 
the estimated cash requirements to complete the remaining products as of september  were expected to be approximately million 
the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  including  unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements  including  for example changes requested by the fda in connection with pma or nda applications for products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot provide assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill the purchase price allocation for cytyc initially resulted in goodwill of approximately billion 
the factors contributing to the recognition of this amount of goodwill were based upon several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the combination 
these benefits included the expectation that our complementary products and technologies would create a leading women s healthcare company with an enhanced presence in hospitals  private practices and healthcare organizations 
we also expected to realize substantial synergies through the use of cytyc s ob gyn and breast surgeon sales channel to cross sell our existing and future products 
our merger with cytyc provided us broader channel coverage within the united states and expanded geographic reach internationally  as well as increased scale and scope for further expanding operations through product development and complementary strategic transactions 
in connection with our fiscal annual goodwill impairment test  performed on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our mammosite reporting 
table of contents unit 
as a result of our interim impairment analysis of goodwill as of december   we recorded an impairment charge of billion related to the goodwill from the merger with cytyc 
see the critical accounting policies below for additional information pertaining to the interim impairment analysis of our goodwill

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of million in our breast health products and to a lesser extent a million decline in skeletal health products partially offset by increases in gyn surgical and diagnostic products of million and million  respectively 
breast health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million decline in digital mammography systems revenues principally due to product mix as we sold a greater number of defeatured selenia systems  which have lower average selling prices than our full featured models  a shift to a higher level of international sales  and to a lesser extent  we experienced slight pressure on average selling prices 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of units sold of our new d d dimensions systems 
the decline in revenue is also due to phasing out the supply of digital detectors to an oem and closing our aeg organic photoconductor drum coatings manufacturing operations in shanghai  which in aggregate accounted for million in revenues in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in revenues due to higher volumes of our breast biopsy products  offset in part by a slight reduction in average selling prices for these products 
we also generated million in revenues from sales of mri breast coils through our acquisition of sentinelle medical in the fourth quarter of fiscal diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales of our cervista hpv tests  and to a lesser extent other molecular tests 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in thinprep pap test volume domestically due to the decline in doctor visits  which we believe is attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment  continuing economic uncertainty and recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings  and the discontinuance of certain molecular asrs  which contributed million of revenue in in addition  we have seen laboratory consolidation  which impacts our average selling prices due to volume purchase discounts to the larger laboratories 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to growing sales of the adiana system  which was approved by the fda in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of novasure products sold 
we also experienced a slight increase in novasure average selling prices 
skeletal health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in mini c arms sales of million as a result of a reduction in the number of units sold 
in addition  there was a million decrease in osteoporosis assessment product sales principally due to a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold worldwide 
this product line has experienced a difficult capital equipment environment worldwide and the ongoing effects of the reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis exams in the us recently the reimbursement situation improved  which may benefit future demand for this product line 

table of contents in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our full field digital mammography systems 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the significant intangible asset impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal was compared to in fiscal cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased across our business segments  except skeletal health which remained relatively flat with the prior year 
the decline in gross margin in the current year was driven by a shift in product mix of our selenia digital mammography systems to lower margin configurations  a higher level of international sales  and a slight reduction in average selling prices in our breast health segment 
in addition  we experienced unfavorable manufacturing variances related to our adiana system and lower absorption of manufacturing costs 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology 
these intangible assets are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the increase in amortization in fiscal is due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  and is primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the 
table of contents breast brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for mammosite 
we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets  which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue selling a certain product acquired in the third wave acquisition  which was an indicator of impairment  and therefore  we performed an impairment test 
due to the insufficient cash flows to be generated  the company determined that the related asset group s fair value was de minimus and recorded an impairment charge of million comprised of developed technology of million and capitalized license fees of million 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin has improved to in fiscal from in fiscal due in part to the improved absorption of fixed service costs as a result of the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health business 
we have been able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of full field digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets litigation related settlement charges  net acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in clinical trial costs  primarily related to our tomosynthesis product  
table of contents the addition of expenses from sentinelle medical since august  the acquisition date  compensation and benefits  and engineering programs for a number of projects for product enhancements and new products 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction of pre release production costs that were incurred in fiscal related to the adiana system that are no longer being incurred due to its fda approval and commercial release in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
at any point in time  we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary period to period 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher distributor and third party commissions  additional expenses related to recently released products  trade shows and website marketing partially offset by lower compensation and expenditures for advertising and medical education 
we expect to incur additional expenses in fiscal with the launch of our direct to consumer advertising campaign for our novasure product 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher legal fees related to increased litigation related activities  principally the ethicon and senorx lawsuits  and higher employee compensation and benefits principally due to a transition payment to the former ceo of million in the first quarter of fiscal and related continuing retention compensation  an increase in the value of our supplemental executive retirement plan serp  and increased bonuses  offset slightly by lower costs from the departure of certain employees that were not replaced 
in addition  transaction costs related to acquisitions are now recorded as an expense and not capitalized as part of the purchase price  increasing general and administrative expenses in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by lower fees for accounting  tax and other consulting services  lower bad debt expense  and lower charges for the write off of certain corporate related fixed assets in fiscal amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with performing our company wide annual budgeting and forecasting process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit and recorded intangible asset impairment charges discussed above and below 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long term growth projections 
after determining the fair values of mammosite s long lived assets  other than goodwill  and writing these assets down to their fair values  we performed the step goodwill impairment test for mammosite 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge

the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 

table of contents breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating loss operating loss as a of segment revenue breast health revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in service revenues that is substantially related to additional service contracts for the increased number of selenia systems in our installed base partially offset by the decrease in product revenues of million discussed above 
the operating loss for this business segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our mammosite reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the million goodwill impairment charge related to our mammosite reporting unit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal excluding the impact of these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  operating income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million litigation settlement charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal for the settlement of the ethicon matter discussed above 
overall  our gross margins declined significantly to due to the intangible asset impairment charge to write down developed technology related to our mammosite reporting unit 
excluding this impairment  gross margins were relatively flat at in both the current and prior year periods 
gross margin was positively impacted by an improved service revenues gross margin as a result of our relatively fixed cost structure to support service contracts  which was partially offset by a reduction in product gross margin to from in fiscal primarily due to a shift in product mix of our selenia digital mammography systems to lower margin configurations  a higher level of international sales  and slight pressure on average selling prices 
in addition  the increase in service revenues  which have lower gross margins than product sales  resulted in overall lower gross margins 
the fiscal operating loss included higher clinical trial expenses principally related to clinical trials for our tomosynthesis product  increased litigation costs and higher third party commissions compared to fiscal fiscal also included sentinelle medical operating expenses and acquisition related transaction costs and charges aggregating approximately million

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales decreased compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from our breast health products and  to a lesser extent  a million decrease in revenues from our skeletal health products  partially offset by increased revenues in our diagnostics and gyn surgical segments of million and million  respectively 
these increases were due in part to a full year of revenue for these segments in fiscal compared to the inclusion of only weeks of operating results for fiscal as we acquired these segments with the cytyc merger on october  included in the increased diagnostics revenue is additional revenue from third wave of million 
we acquired third wave in the fourth quarter of fiscal and as such had a full year of revenue in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal breast health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in digital mammography systems sales caused primarily by a reduction in the number of selenia full field mammography systems and related components  including our cad software  sold domestically  and to a lesser extent  internationally 
in addition  we experienced a slight deterioration of average selling prices  both domestically and internationally  driven by the current economic environment for capital purchases  and less expensive configurations of the units being sold 
also contributing to the decrease was a million decrease in multicare stereotactic table sales primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold  principally in the us we attribute the decline in sales of breast health capital equipment and related products primarily to the more difficult economic and capital spending environment 
we also experienced a decline in our mammosite single lumen products of million due to increased competition as a result of lower reimbursement rates compared to multi lumen products 
partially offsetting the declines in sales referenced above was an million increase in revenues from our breast biopsy products 
diagnostics product sales  which include thinprep  rapid fetal fibronectin test and our third wave products  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of third wave revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests 
the increase in fiscal is also due to the inclusion of cytyc s results for the full fiscal year versus weeks in fiscal while we received fda approval of the cervista hpv hr and cervista hpv tests in march  the revenue contribution was modest in fiscal gyn surgical product sales  which include our novasure system and adiana system  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of novasure systems sold 
the increase is also due to the inclusion of gyn surgical s revenue for the full fiscal year versus weeks in fiscal revenues from the adiana system  which we received fda approval on july   were modest as the us and international market launches were limited

cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal was compared to in fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our diagnostics and gyn surgical segments as a percentage of our total product sales as these products have a lower product cost as a percent of revenue compared to our breast health and skeletal health products 
in addition  our cost of product sales in fiscal included additional costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair value in purchase accounting of million related to the merger with cytyc and million related to the third wave acquisition 
in fiscal  the impact of these costs was only million related to the third wave inventory write up 
our margins in fiscal were also positively impacted by our cost reduction 
table of contents initiatives implemented in the first half of  which included securing lower material costs from our vendors 
partially offsetting these improvements  was a decrease in gross margin in our breast health segment  primarily attributable to lower absorption of manufacturing costs due to lower volumes and to a lesser extent  a slight deterioration of average selling prices  driven by the current economic environment for capital purchases  and less expensive configurations of the units being sold 
fiscal and cost of product sales included charges of million and million  respectively  for impairment of mri inventory and a related purchase obligation  which was fulfilled in fiscal cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology  which are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense is due partly to the method of recognition based on expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the merger with cytyc  which increased to million from million in fiscal  and a full year of third wave related amortization of million compared to million in fiscal cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue selling a certain product acquired in the third wave acquisition as a result of communications from the fda in the second quarter of fiscal regarding the approval process 
this decision was an indicator of impairment  and we performed an impairment test  which indicated the undiscounted cash flows the asset group would generate over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
due to the insufficient cash flows to be generated  the company determined that the related asset group s fair value was de minimus and recorded an impairment charge of million comprised of developed technology of million and capitalized license fees of million 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal due in part to the improved absorption of fixed service costs and the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health segment

credit agreement in  in connection with our acquisition of third wave  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders collectively  the lenders and secured financing in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit facility consisted of million under a senior secured tranche a term loan term loan a  million under a senior secured tranche b term loan term loan b  and million under a senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
we borrowed million under the term loans 
during fiscal  we paid

sale of gestiva on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell full us and world wide rights to our gestiva pharmaceutical product to k v pharmaceutical company kv upon approval of the pending gestiva new drug application the gestiva nda by the fda for a purchase price of million 
the gestiva product is a drug that  if approved by the fda  could be used in the prevention of preterm births in pregnant women with a history of at least one spontaneous preterm birth 
under this agreement  we received million of the purchase price in fiscal  and the balance was due upon final approval of the gestiva nda by the fda on or before february  and the production of a quantity of gestiva suitable to enable the commercial launch of the product 
this million was recorded as a deferred gain within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
either party had the right to terminate the agreement if fda approval was not obtained by february  on january   the parties executed an amendment to the agreement eliminating the date by which fda approval must be received and extending the term indefinitely 
in consideration of executing this amendment  the purchase price was increased to million 
we received million upon the signing of the amendment  which has been recorded as a deferred gain  and are due to receive an additional million upon fda approval of the product and an additional million over a nine month period beginning one year following fda approval 
under the arrangement  we are continuing our efforts to obtain fda approval of the gestiva nda 
all costs incurred in these efforts are being reimbursed by kv and recorded as a credit against research and development expenses 
these reimbursed costs have not been material to date on an annual basis 
we expect that the amounts recorded in deferred gain will be recognized upon the closing of the transaction following final fda approval of the gestiva nda 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the requisite fda approval  that the transaction will be completed or that we will receive the balance of the purchase price 
moreover  if kv terminates the agreement prior to the transfer of the rights to the gestiva product as a result of a breach by us of a material representation  warranty  covenant or agreement  we will be required to return the funds previously received as well as expenses reimbursed by kv 
contingent earn out payments 
as a result of the merger with cytyc  we assumed the obligation to the former adiana stockholders to make contingent earn out payments tied to the achievement of milestones 
the milestone payments include potential contingent payments of up to million based on worldwide sales of the adiana system in the first year following fda approval first contingent period and on annual incremental sales growth thereafter through december  we received fda approval of the adiana system on july   and we began accruing contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the defined percentage of worldwide sales of the product 
these amounts are being recorded as additional purchase price 
the total accrued contingent consideration  net at september  is million  of which million was earned during the first contingent period 
under the terms of the agreement  the first contingent period payment was paid to the adiana shareholders in october  net of certain holdbacks 
the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of qualifying legal expenses in defense of the adiana intellectual property  and we have the right to offset contingent consideration payments to the adiana shareholders with these qualifying legal costs 
on august   we acquired sentinelle medical 
in addition to the up front cash payment of million  which was net of certain adjustments  we incurred the obligation to the former sentinelle medical stockholders to make contingent payouts over a two year period of up to a maximum of million 
the contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded 
table of contents the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of million based on our estimates and assumptions of revenue growth 
of this amount  million is recorded as a current liability and million is recorded as a long term liability 
the contractual obligations table below does not include the obligation to pay contingent consideration to the shareholders of sentinelle medical or adiana

the first put date on the exchange notes is december  the above table does not reflect this exchange 
see above under convertible notes for additional information 
we acquired the financing leases in connection with our acquisition of cytyc in fiscal cytyc had executed two leases for an office building and for a manufacturing facility  which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under us gaap 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information 
this represents certain non cancelable supply contracts 
for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability or cost effectiveness  certain key components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier 
to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability  long term supply contracts have been executed with these suppliers 
in certain of these contracts  a minimum purchase commitment has been established 
pension obligations do not include our obligation under the serp of million  which is recorded as a current liability 
the serp benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment 
this represents a private equity investment commitment with a limited liability partnership  which could be paid over the succeeding two years 
the above table does not reflect our long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under fin codified primarily in asc  income taxes totaling million 
due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties  we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non current liabilities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 

table of contents future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this report  we believe that cash flow from operations will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
our longer term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments  or to repay our convertible notes 
the holders of the original notes in the principal amount of billion may require us to repurchase the notes on december   and on each of december    and at a repurchase price equal to of their accreted principal amount  and the holders of the exchange notes in the principal amount of million may require us to repurchase the notes on december   december   december   december  and december  these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above referenced risk factors as elsewhere in this report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims 
in connection with these legal proceedings and claims  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete 
table of contents or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product expiration or end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of product revenue 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the recent financial and economic turmoil or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc in fiscal  contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition 
the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios  which are probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario 
these cash flow projections are discounted with an 
table of contents appropriate risk adjusted rate 
on an ongoing basis until such contingent amounts are earned  the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc  we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet 
under asc  in process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete  if at all  the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life 
prior to the adoption of asc  we expensed the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our fiscal and acquisitions  we used risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows  ranging from to 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
trade names represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair 
table of contents value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in the breast health reportable segment  due to changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in us lowering the financial projections for mammosite 
as a result  we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test pursuant to asc and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets 
these undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
the expected future cash flows are level inputs under asc and are those expected to be generated by the market participants  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of million to write these intangible assets down to their fair value 
the charge was comprised of million related to developed technology  which was recorded in cost of product sales  million related to customer relationships and million related to trade names  which were recorded in impairment of intangible assets 
in addition  under the annual goodwill impairment test  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million see below for further discussion 
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on the weighted average cost of capital wacc of market participants 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter  consistent with our policy 
we utilized discounted cash flow dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows and market multiples 
as a result of completing step  all of the company s reporting units  except mammosite  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
mammosite s fair value has declined from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in its long term growth rates 
the changes in mammosite s financial projections are a result of changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current 
table of contents trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
the dcf calculation of fair value was positively impacted by a reduction in the discount rate to from used in the fiscal annual impairment test 
we performed the step analysis for mammosite  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
for illustrative purposes had the fair value of mammosite been lower  the charge would have been higher by million 
if the fair value of the company s other reporting units had been lower by  one reporting unit would have failed step requiring a step analysis 
this reporting unit is in the breast health reportable segment and had a fair value at the annual impairment measurement date that exceeded its carrying value by with goodwill of million 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by use of the dcf  and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit 
for our other reporting units with goodwill aggregating billion  we believe that these reporting units are not at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
during the first quarter of fiscal  based upon a combination of factors  including the deteriorating macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets  we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of december  as a result  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  step of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain reporting units  acquired in connection with the cytyc acquisition  exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for each of the applicable reporting units 
the step analysis required us to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each of these reporting units to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill by reporting unit 
due to the complexities and time involved in preparing the step analysis  we had not commenced the step analysis as of february   the date we filed our form q for the quarter ended december  as a result of the fact that we had not commenced the step analysis and the complexity of the analysis required to complete the step analysis  we were unable to determine that an impairment loss  in accordance with asc  was both probable and reasonably estimable at december  we completed the step analysis during our second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of billion 
this impairment charge is comprised of billion for gyn surgical  million for diagnostics  and million for breast health related to our mammosite reporting unit acquired from cytyc 
we believe that our procedures and related assumptions for estimating the reporting units fair value are reasonable and consistent with the market conditions that existed at the time of the impairment test 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair values of each reporting unit for which we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the second quarter of fiscal been lower by as of december   we would have recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
based on our estimates as of december   the impact of reducing our fair value estimates for our other reporting units  for which we did not record any goodwill impairment charges  by would have had no impact on the goodwill assessment for those reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to complete the annual impairment test  we updated our interim impairment test results and performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of most of our reporting units utilizing our fiscal forecast with updated 
table of contents long term growth assumptions 
for one reporting unit  we utilized the results of our interim impairment test 
pursuant to asc  we concluded that it met the required criteria to use the estimated fair value determined from its interim impairment analysis for this reporting unit because the composition of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit had not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  the most recent fair value determination resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by a substantial margin  and management concluded  based on an analysis of current events that had occurred and circumstances that had changed since the most recent fair value determination  that it is remote that the current fair value of the reporting unit would not exceed their carrying amounts 
as a result of completing step  all of our reporting units  except one  had a fair value exceeding their carrying value  and as such step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
for the reporting unit that failed step  we completed step and determined that an impairment charge was not required due to the fair value of the implied goodwill exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of this reporting unit at june  been lower by  the company still would not have recorded any impairment charge 
if the fair value of our other reporting units had been lower by  two reporting units would have failed step requiring a step analysis 
these reporting units  one in the diagnostics reportable segment and one in the skeletal health reportable segment  had fair values at june  that exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively  and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
we did not record goodwill impairment charges in fiscal for either of these reporting units 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products  primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products  and related services  which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems 
in september  the fasb ratified asc update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards that are currently within the scope of asc  subtopic  which is the revenue recognition standard for multiple element arrangements 
asu provides for three significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance as follows removes the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement 
this may result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting 
modifies the manner in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separately identified deliverables 
asu requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  if vsoe is not available 
each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means vsoe or tpe to determine the selling price of that deliverable 
the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling prices 
eliminates use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method  which results in the discount in the transaction being evenly allocated to the separate units of accounting 

table of contents in september  the fasb ratified asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu amends the existing revenue recognition accounting standards to remove tangible products that contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
as permitted  we elected to early adopt these new accounting standards at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for transactions originating or materially modified on or after september  these accounting standards generally do not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions  and most products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
the impact of adopting these new accounting standards was not material to our financial statements for the year ended september   and if they were applied in the same manner to fiscal and would not have had a material impact to revenue recorded in fiscal or  or any of the interim periods therein 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements for capital equipment sales  primarily in our breast health and skeletal health reporting segments  are multiple element arrangements  including services  such as installation and training  and multiple products 
in accordance with asc  based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as revenue as such services are performed 
the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered 
there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we typically determine the selling price of our products and services based on vsoe and determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining vsoe 
we typically have had vsoe for our products and services 
if vsoe cannot be established  which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately  stand alone sales are too infrequent  or product pricing is not within a narrow range  we attempt to establish the selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we cannot determine vsoe or tpe  we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand alone sale of the product or service 
esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies  internal costs and gross margin objectives  method of distribution  information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 
some of our products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
prior to the adoption of asu  we had determined that except for our cad products and dimensions d d full field digital mammography products dimensions  the software element in our other products was incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and were 
table of contents not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  asc  software revenue recognition 
we had determined that given the significance of the software component s functionality to our cad systems and dimensions products  which are in the breast health segment  these products were within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
asc generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value 
if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element  the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements 
for multiple element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post contract customer support pcs has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
upon the release of the dimensions product in fiscal  we completed an evaluation of the software component in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules 
as a result  we had determined that the dimensions product contained software that was more than incidental to the product as a whole and should be accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules 
in connection with the adoption of asu  we re evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our products and determined that the dimensions products  which have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality ie  it is a tangible product  are scoped out of asc  however  our cad products will continue to be subject to asc dimensions transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal will continue to be accounted for under asc under customer usage agreements  we install certain equipment for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price generally including a usage fee for the equipment over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as disposable products are delivered 
we also rent certain equipment to customers and revenue from rental agreements is recorded over the term of the rental agreements 
product warranties products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units that we issue to our employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor s model 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 

table of contents expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc  stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of september  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of september   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units  respectively  that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have recognized net deferred tax liabilities of million at september  and million at september  the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and the debt discount and original issuance discount on our convertible notes 
the tax assets relate primarily net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  stock based compensation  research credits and the payment we received on the sale of the gestiva asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
on september   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
codified primarily in asc  income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
as a result of our adoption of fin  we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million as a decrease to opening retained earnings 

table of contents we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of approximately million as of september  and million as of september  at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
in the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by million due to expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities  of which million will reduce the company s effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asc topic  business combinations formerly sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
asc replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
asc retains the guidance in sfas for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
asc will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally to affect income tax expense 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted asc effective september  the impact of the adoption of asc is reflected in our fiscal consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
codified within asc topic  consolidation 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
this accounting standard clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas codified in asu 
sfas modifies how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
sfas clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly 
table of contents impact the entity s economic performance 
sfas requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
sfas also requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year 
we have not completed our assessment of the impact sfas  if any  will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  cost method investments  accounts payable and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible note  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
at september   we had billion of principal of convertible notes outstanding  which was recorded at billion  net of the unamortized debt discount 
the fair value of our convertible notes was approximately billion as of september  based on the trading price as of that date 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposure is in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we conduct business worldwide and maintain sales and service offices outside the united states as well as manufacturing facilities in germany  costa rica and canada 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our international sales are denominated in a number of currencies  primarily the euro and us dollar 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses denominated in euros are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred net foreign exchange losses of million  million and million  respectively
