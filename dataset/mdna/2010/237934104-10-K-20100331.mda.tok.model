you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview datalink provides solutions and services that make data centers more efficient  manageable and responsive to changing business needs 
focused on mid and large size companies  datalink assesses  designs  deploys  and supports infrastructures servers  storage and networks at the heart of the data center 
our portfolio of solutions and services spans three practices consolidation and virtualization  enhanced data protection and advanced network infrastructures 
datalink offers a full suite of practice specific analysis  design  implementation  management  and support services 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as servers  disk arrays  tape systems  networking and interconnection components and software products 
datalink s data center strategy is supported through multiple trends in the market in supporting the market and our customers with a single vendor to provide their data center infrastructure needs 
gartner estimates the server virtualization management market will grow by nearly a compound annual growth rate cagr between and although gartner estimates that storage costs are approximately of a typical data center spending budget  datalink s data center portfolio covers services and products estimated by gartner to represent over of a data center s spending budget 
as of december   we have locations throughout the united states 
we historically have derived our greatest percentage of net sales from customers located in the central part of the united states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with datalink and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the data center infrastructure solutions and services market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage  server and networking system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage  server and networking experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data center infrastructure solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions and timing to place orders with us and the size of those orders 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data center infrastructure market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  datalink s market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data center infrastructure industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as datalink to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for datalink  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scaleable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on increasing our sales team productivity 
scaling our existing geographic locations and expanding into new locations 
expanding our customer support revenues 
enhancing our professional services business 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and technical teams to increase productivity 
investing in customer facing teams to acquire top tier sales and technical talent which we believe will increase our market share in key locations 
deepening our presence in existing enterprise accounts and penetrating new enterprise accounts 
exploring potential acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
targeting high growth market segments and deploying new technologies which focus on cost saving technologies for our customers 
driving high levels of efficiency by streamlining our supply chain and expanding our professional services tools 
expanding our customer support capabilities and tools based professional services offerings that we believe will provide more value to our customers 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including that continued worldwide economic troubles may adversely affect our customers buying patterns 
we may not increase our productivity and may lose  or not successfully recruit and retain key sales  technical or other personnel 
competition is intense and may adversely impact our profit margin 
customers have many options for data storage products and services 
we may not successfully identify acquisition candidates or profitably integrate any business we acquire 
acquisitions in october  we acquired the networking solutions division of minneapolis based cross telecom cross  which qualified as a business combination 
we completed an asset purchase of million paid in cash 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  cross entered into a services agreement with us under which it agreed to purchase at least million of cisco networking products and services from us over the next three years 
we believe the acquisition of this team of certified cisco networking experts will be additive to our expertise in designing  implementing and managing sophisticated virtualized data center  storage and backup recovery solutions 
in addition  we obtained cross cisco silver certification 
please see note to our financial statements for further information 
in december  we acquired the reseller business of incentra  llc incentra 
under the asset purchase agreement  we paid incentra million 
we paid million at closing in cash  of which we held back  as security for certain indemnification obligations of incentra 
in addition  we paid incentra million for the working capital associated with incentra s reseller business through the delivery of million in cash and a million secured promissory note due march  the million working capital payment is subject to post closing adjustments  either upward or downward  in connection with the amount  if any  that incentra s actual working capital at the closing date was greater or less than million 
we will make any downward adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis 
we will make any upward adjustments in the amount of for each dollar by which actual working capital at closing  after taking into account the collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable through june   exceeded million 
the promissory note is secured by the assets we purchased under the asset purchase agreement 
this acquisition doubles our presence in chicago and the northeast and provides us with a significant presence in the west 
our combined team now has expanded experience to design and implement complex data center solutions  which will deliver increased productivity and efficiency for our customers 
our results for reflect the addition of incentra s reseller business for thirteen days 
please see note to our financial statements for further information 
in january  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with midrange computer systems inc mcsi  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we believe the acquisition strengthened our presence in our then existing regional markets and expanded our reach into a number of then key new regional markets 
we paid a purchase price of approximately million for mcsi  consisting of million cash and  shares of our common stock 
our results of operations for reflect the addition of mcsi for eleven months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note of the notes to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies we used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we consider some of these significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
more specifically  critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters at the time of the estimate 
they also require us to consider different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in our estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  which would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot determine estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects with certainty 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates against historical experience and various other assumptions we believe applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates may change as new events occur  as we obtain additional information and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and we have included them in our financial statements as soon as we learned of them 
our management reviews the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we have consistently applied our critical accounting policies throughout our accompanying financial statements 
results of operations we ended with a record backlog of million  representing firm orders we expect to recognize as revenue in the next days 
this compares to a backlog of million as of december  and million as of december  in the current economic environment  we continue to see the negative impact of the worldwide economic downturn on many of our customers  resulting in greater scrutiny given to data center spending projects and providing us with less visibility into their purchasing plans 
we cannot predict what impact these economic uncertainties will have on our profitability going forward 
our sales decreased million or to million for as compared to our gross margin decreased million or to million for as compared to our earnings from operations decreased million from million in to a loss of  in the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering integration costs amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating earnings comparison of years ended december   and the following table shows  for the periods indicated  revenue and gross profit information for our product and service sales 
years ended december  product sales service sales product gross profit service gross profit product gross profit as a percentage of product sales service gross profit as a percentage of service sales net sales 
our product sales decreased in from to million  and increased in from to million 
our service sales  which includes customer support  consulting and installation services  increased in over to million  and increased in from to million 
our results include revenues of million from the acquisition of incentra s reseller business 
the decline in our product revenues in as compared to reflects the continuing negative impact of the economic slowdown that many of our customers are experiencing 
the modest increase in our product sales in as compared to is primarily from the successful integration of mcsi and increased storage spending in the marketplace 
our more recent product revenues continue to reflect our customers closer scrutiny of expenditures as they focus more attention on the actual or anticipated impact that current economic conditions may have on the growth and profitability of their businesses 
this has created longer sales cycles with a number of large project delays 
we believe that this spending slow down among our customers will continue into the increase in our service revenues for over and over reflects an increase in our customer support contract revenues 
for  customer support contract revenues increased million or over while installation and configuration service revenues decreased million or mirroring our decrease in product sales over the same period 
for  customer support contract revenues increased million or over  and installation and configuration service revenues increased million or over the same period 
for both and  the slowdown in the growth of our customer support contract revenues and installation and configuration services relates to the downturn in our product revenues 
we experienced a slight benefit in sales of customer support contracts related to product sales  which we recognize over the contract term 
with the decline in product revenues in late and for  we expect our customer support and installation and configuration services to decrease in and we cannot assure that our future customer support contract sales will not similarly decline 
we had no single customer account for or greater of our revenues for the years ended december   and gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  decreasing from in and increasing from in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales was in as compared to in and in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales is impacted by the mix and type of projects we complete for our customers 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased for over due to our renewed focus on pursuing new customer account opportunities and pricing pressures from our customers due to the current economic downturn 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased for over due to the continued efforts by our sales force to sell higher margin storage solutions 
this included the increased percentage of our product sales coming from disk sales which have historically experienced higher margins 
our product gross profit is also impacted by the various programs we have in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these vendor incentive programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  particularly in light of current economic conditions  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales was in as compared to in and in in  our service gross profit decreased because our vendors delivered a greater percentage of our installation and configuration services  which typically carries a lower margin 
in  we had only  in mcsi acquisition purchase accounting adjustments that required us to reduce revenues and corresponding margins to reflect the fair value of acquired maintenance contracts 
accordingly  for  our gross profit percentage of service sales returned to our then historical range of between and 
we estimate that our product gross margins will decline to between and during as we implement our strategy of selling solutions into the data center that include lower margin servers and networking products 
for  we expect service gross margins to remain in the range of to  with total gross margins of between and 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for over is due to a million reduction in variable compensation and commissions  in turn related to the overall decline in revenues and gross profit in the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for over is primarily a result of higher commission expense of million which  in turn is due to our revenue increase for the year 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales from to is due to the overall decline in our revenue for the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from to reflects better leverage of our fixed costs as revenues increased in as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
we will continue to carefully monitor our travel and other sales and marketing expenses in light of current economic conditions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or in however  spending included  of severance agreement payments for several of our former executives 
cost reduction efforts in resulted in savings of  by canceling our annual sales meeting 
we also lowered our travel and entertainment  training and communication expenses by   and  respectively 
the modest increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars for as compared to is primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense of  related to exceeding performance objectives 
our general and administrative expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales for as compared to due to the overall decline in our revenue for our general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales for as compared to  as a result of more controlled spending coupled with an increase in revenues 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
therefore  if we continue to incur a slowdown in product sales during because of current economic conditions  we will have higher engineering expenses 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the slight increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is due to an increase in salaries and benefits of  as we continually invest in regional engineering support 
the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of million for additional regional and customer support resources and an increase in variable compensation expense of  related to exceeding performance objectives 
the increase in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to and as compared to is primarily the result of investments in regional engineering support  regional management and customer support resources 
integration costs 
we had integration expenses of million in we incurred the majority of these expenses for the acquisition of the reseller business of incentra in december integration expenses for the incentra transaction included audit  legal and other outside consulting fees  expenses for our transition services agreement with incentra and severance payments 
we had integration expenses of  in related to the january acquisition of mcsi 
those integration expenses included salaries and benefits of mcsi employees who assisted with the initial integration but whom we ultimately did not retain  together with retention bonuses and severance payments 
intangible amortization 
we had expenses related to the amortization of finite lived intangible assets of   and  in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets increased to  in from  in due to the acquisition of the networking solutions division of cross telecom and the incentra reseller business 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from  in due to the amortization of backlog from our mcsi acquisition 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of the networking solutions division of cross telecom consisted of a services agreement and certifications having estimated lives of four years and two years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our incentra reseller business acquisition consisted of trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three years  one year and eight years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our mcsi acquisition consisted of customer relationships and backlog having estimated lives of six years and two months  respectively 
we are amortizing all of these finite lived intangible assets using the straight line method 
we expect amortization expense to be approximately million in in accordance with fasb topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues  incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for review by our chief operations decision maker 
accordingly  we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit 
for  and  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step screens for potential impairment 
if there is an indication of possible impairment  we must complete the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record  if any 
we consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
since we have one reporting unit  we estimate our fair value based on our market capitalization plus a control premium 
as of our measurement date  december   our market capitalization was well above our stockholders equity without a control premium 
a control premium is the amount that a buyer would pay over a company s current market price based on its traded price per share ie market capitalization to acquire a controlling interest 
control premiums are justified by expected acquisition synergies  such as expected cash flow increases from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
we determine the appropriate range of control premiums to apply by reviewing those paid over the past three years by similar companies with market capitalizations of between million and million 
we cannot assure that continuing adverse economic conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment testing or an impairment charge 
in addition  we cannot assure that our business  or others of similar size  would ever sell at a price reflecting our estimated control premium 
we further cannot assure that our market capitalization represents the fair value of our reporting unit or that a sustained drop in our market capitalization would not cause any impairment 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill to determine whether interim asset impairment testing is warranted 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
we generally measure fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses 
for  and  we identified no triggering events that required us to evaluate the impairment of our long lived assets 
operating earnings 
we realized a loss from operations of  in and operating earnings of million in and million in our loss from operations in is a result of a decrease in our revenues and margins due to the current economic downturn and integration costs we incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of incentra s reseller business 
the increase in our earnings from operations in as compared to is a result of higher revenues and gross margins partially offset by higher operating expenses 
income taxes 
we had income tax expense of  in which resulted in our estimated effective tax rate of 
for  we had income tax expense despite our loss position due to certain permanent differences  including those for meals and entertainment and incentive stock compensation expense 
we had income tax expense of million in which resulted in our estimated effective tax rate of 
we had income tax expense of  in which resulted in our estimated effective tax rate of 
as of december   we had million of federal net operating carryforwards that will expire in also at that date  we had million of state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future state taxable income 
these state tax carryforwards expire between and for and  respectively  we recorded approximately  and  to equity for tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
for  we recorded approximately  to equity for tax expenses associated with the exercise of stock options 
in future periods of taxable earnings  we expect to report an income tax provision using an effective tax rate of approximately to 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and we have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited information

in thousands net sales gross profit operating earnings loss net earnings loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large data center evaluations and purchases  delays in data center installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  and trends in the data center industry in general or the geographic and industry specific markets in which operate now or in the future 
in addition  current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place or delay orders with us  and the size and scale of their orders 
further  our success in integrating any acquired business or in opening any new field offices could impact our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents since our initial public offering we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was  cash provided by operating activities for was primarily impacted by a net loss for the year of  an increase in deferred income taxes of million primarily related to an accounting method change with the irs for income tax purposes

a non cash charge of million for stock compensation expense 
a non cash charge of million for depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
cash provided by operating activities for was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was primarily impacted by net earnings for the year of million 
a net  increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer typically pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows

a net million increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer typically pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows 
a net decrease in working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable of million reflecting increased sales activity during the fourth quarter of cash used in investing activities was million in in  our primary use of cash for investing activities was to complete our october acquisition for the networking solutions division of minneapolis based cross telecom and our december acquisition for the incentra reseller business 
in addition  we invested an additional million in short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was  in in  we had proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million offset by purchases of  for upgraded computer equipment and telephone systems and leasehold improvements 
cash used in investing activities was million in in  we used this cash primarily for the acquisition of mcsi  purchase of a short term investment  and leasehold improvements and upgraded computer equipment 
cash used in financing activities in and was  and  respectively  which was primarily for the redemption of restricted shares for tax withholding payments 
cash provided by financing activities in was  which we received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
we have an eleven year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately million 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied 
the initial term of the sublease is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublease requires rent payments ranging from  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
in october  we acquired the networking solutions division of minneapolis based cross telecom  which qualified as a business combination 
this was an asset purchase for million in cash 
in december  we acquired the reseller business of incentra 
under the asset purchase agreement  we paid incentra million 
we paid million at closing in cash  of which we held back  as security for certain indemnification obligations of incentra 
in addition  we paid incentra million for the working capital associated with its reseller business through the delivery of million in cash and a million secured promissory note to be paid on or before march  the million working capital payment is subject to post closing adjustments  either upward or downward  in connection with the amount  if any  that incentra s actual working capital at the closing date was greater or less than million 
we will make any downward adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis 
we will make any upward adjustments in the amount of for each dollar by which actual working capital at closing  after taking into account the collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable through june   exceeded million 
the promissory note is secured by the assets we purchased under the asset purchase agreement 
in january  we acquired mcsi  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we paid approximately million for mcsi  consisting of million cash and  shares of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash balance and funds generated from operations will finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we believe if the need should arise to borrow funds  we could obtain a secured facility 
because of our interest in pursuing additional acquisitions  we may consider a future sale of our common stock 
however  the current state of the financial markets could impact our ability to obtain such funding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consist of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases and a note payable to the seller of an acquired business as follows notes payable lease obligations sublease agreements net lease obligations in thousands thereafter we periodically enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
we would recognize any significant losses implicit in these contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
the rent includes the costs of common area management  common systems repairs  real estate taxes and standard utilities 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures during primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems and upgraded computer equipment 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements inventory valuation 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
business combinations 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we expect to acquire additional businesses in the future 
in a business combination  we determine the fair value of all acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and all assumed liabilities 
we allocate the fair value of the acquisition to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability 
we classify any remaining fair value of the acquisition as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows we expect to generate with the acquired assets 
we amortize certain identifiable  finite life intangible assets  such as service agreements  certifications  trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships  on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from one to eight years 
we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets we determine to have indefinite lives 
accordingly  the accounting for acquisitions has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our operating results 
during  we applied business combination accounting to our acquisitions of the networking solutions division of cross telecom  and to our acquisition of the incentra reseller business 
see note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information about the application of business combination accounting to these acquisitions 
valuation of goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues  incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for review by our chief operations decision maker 
accordingly  we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit 
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step screens for potential impairment 
if there is an indication of possible impairment  we must complete the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record  if any 
we consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
valuation of long lived assets  including finite lived intangibles 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation 
we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
this requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes model to determine the fair value of share based payment awards 
our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  will affect our determination of fair value 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock grants based upon the closing price of our stock on the grant date 
we base recognition of compensation expense for our performance based  non vested shares on management s estimate of the probable outcome of the performance condition 
management reassesses the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis 
changes in management s estimate of meeting these performance conditions may result in significant fluctuations in compensation expense from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which changes how we account for business acquisitions occurring after january  the guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this guidance have  among other things  impacted the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  required us to exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting for acquisitions occurring after january   and changed accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets and tax benefits 
this guidance was effective for us beginning january  in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance regarding disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments including the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value 
this guidance increases the frequency of certain fair value disclosures from annual to quarterly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts and million of short term investments consisting primarily of certificates of deposit 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products and services in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
