item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales in increased to million compared to million in  including a increase in net sales of converted product 
our operating income in increased to million compared to million in our earnings per diluted common share in increased to per diluted common share compared with per diluted common share in our ebitda in increased  to million compared to million in we continued our trend of positive operating cash flow in of million compared with million in  a increase in cash provided from operations 
we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last nine years 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on optimizing the performance of our converting assets and utilizing additional production from our converting assets to pursue profitable sales growth 
during  our converting operations team built upon the efficiency improvements achieved in the latter half of  resulting in increased production of converted products to million cases in the year ended december   compared to million produced in the same period in  an increase of  cases or 
the converting operations team continued to identify and resolve the root causes of production inefficiencies 
additionally  we hired a new converting plant manager in mid with experience in converting operations with a major tissue producer and who has first hand experience installing and starting up state of the art converting equipment 
we also improved our converting operations through several capital projects 
a converting automation project was completed in march the project included the installation of case packers  conveyors and robotics to eliminate inefficient manual processes 
we also completed a project to improve the flexibility of our towel lines by adding new wrappers to two lines and upgrading several key components 
as a result of the reduced labor requirements and increased overall production  our per unit direct labor costs were reduced by approximately in compared to we were able to utilize our additional converting production to increase our converted product net sales by million in or  to million compared to million of net sales in total cases shipped in increased to million cases or compared to the prior year  while our net selling price per ton increased in compared to in order to accelerate the timing of a million expansion project  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock in we intend to use the proceeds of this follow on offering to finance the purchase and installation of our new converting line and to partially finance the construction of our new warehouse 

table of contents due to our strong financial results in and the success of the follow on offering  we were able to accelerate the timetable of our expansion plan  which includes the purchase and the installation of a new converting line and the construction of a new warehouse 
orders have been placed for the new equipment  which is expected to be ready for start up by the end of the second quarter of and to be at full operating rate by the end of the third quarter of construction of our new warehouse began in the fourth quarter of and the first half of the facility is expected to be ready for occupancy by may with the remainder available by july the total project is expected to cost approximately million 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in waste paper prices provided first an opportunity then a challenge in following a strong run up in prices beginning in and continuing through the beginning of the fourth quarter of  waste paper prices dropped significantly during the first half of following a bottoming out in may  waste paper prices have risen each month since july the economic crisis that began in and continued into presented challenges in parent roll sales due to a softening of the parent roll market 
lower travel and lower employment reduced the demand for tissue products in the away from home market  which in turn lowered demand and net selling prices for parent rolls 
what will we focus on in in  we will focus on completion of the construction of our new warehouse and the installation and successful start up of our new converting line 
an on time completion and successful start up of this project is important to meet customer commitments 
following the completion of the warehouse project  we will consolidate all converted product storage at our pryor facility  thereby eliminating the third party costs of warehousing and product transfer 
upon completion  the new converting line will increase our total converting capacity by approximately million cases per year  an increase of 
our sales force is actively pursuing profitable sales growth of the output from the new converting line as well as increased output from our existing equipment 
we intend to focus this new capacity on strategic growth opportunities with existing customers and opportunities with new customers 
the enhanced product quality and product configurations that will be available on the new converting line provide the opportunity to position these products into higher tier product offerings  which should carry higher operating margins 
these higher tier products open up new markets to us that we have previously been unable to penetrate 
we will continue to focus on optimizing our existing operating assets in both converting and paper mill operations 
emphasis will continue to be placed on identifying root causes of issues that impede productivity and to identify ways to improve our overall production costs 
several capital equipment projects to improve operations are planned for  including a project to improve the process to remove contaminants from our waste paper supply and a project to increase the production capacity of our new paper machine 

table of contents business overview we are an integrated manufacturer of bulk tissue paper  known as parent rolls which we convert into a broad line of private label tissue products  including paper towels  bathroom tissue and paper napkins  for the consumer  or at home  market 
we have tailored our operations to serve our core customer base of dollar stores or value retailers and other discount retailers 
we focus on the dollar stores and discount retail market because of their consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units or skus in this market 
all of our converted product revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
parent roll revenue is derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one month time period 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our converted products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of recycled waste paper used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting plant  and the cost of energy 
the private label segment of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
with our steady sales growth over the last eleven years  we have strategically expanded capacity to meet demand 
our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products which generally carry higher margins than parent rolls 
we are currently approaching full capacity utilization of our converting operations  of approximately million annual cases 
we plan to increase our converting capacity by approximately million cases annually with the installation of a new converting line 
this new capacity will allow us to sell all of our parent rolls as converted products and will result in a need to purchase parent rolls on the open market when the line reaches fully operating capacity 
this additional capacity will enable us to both increase sales of existing products and to provide the flexibility to manufacture higher tier products for sales to our core customer base and into new retail channels 
comparative years ended december   and net sales years ended december  in thousands  except price per ton and tons converted product net sales parent roll net sales total net sales total tons shipped average price per ton 
table of contents net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  sales figures include gross selling price  including freight  less discounts and sales promotions 
net sales of converted product increased million in the year ended december   or  to million compared to million in net sales of parent rolls decreased million in the year  or  to million when compared to the same period in the increase in converted product sales was due to an increase in the net selling price per ton of over the prior year and a volume increase of 
the increase in net selling price per ton of converted product was the result of price increases and product content changes that occurred during and early the increased tonnage shipped was due to continued efficiency improvements in our converting lines which provided more products to sell in the marketplace 
the decrease in parent roll sales was due to a decrease in tonnage shipped and a decrease in net sales price per ton 
increased parent roll requirements in our converting operation as well as a soft parent roll market  primarily due to a soft away from home market  where we sell a majority of our parent rolls  were reasons for the lower tonnage shipments 
net selling prices of parent rolls were affected by both the soft parent roll market and lower waste paper costs 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  net sales of converted product in increased million  or  to million compared to million in the same period of  while net sales of parent rolls increased million or in to million  compared to million in in the year ended december   the net selling price per ton of converted product increased compared to the same period of while tonnage shipped decreased slightly 
the decrease in tonnage shipped is due to product content changes made during net sales of parent rolls in the year ended december  increased due to a increase in tonnage shipped and a increase in selling prices compared to the period 
the increase in parent roll tonnage shipped was primarily the result of our increased parent roll production due to the full year effect of running all of our older paper machines on a full time basis 
cost of sales years ended december  in thousands  except gross profit margin and paper cost per ton consumed cost of paper non paper materials  labor  supplies  etc 
sub total depreciation cost of sales gross profit gross profit margin total paper cost per ton consumed major components of cost of sales are the cost of internally produced paper  parent rolls purchased from third parties  raw materials  direct labor and benefits  freight on products shipped to customers  insurance  repairs and maintenance  energy  utilities and depreciation 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  our cost of sales were positively affected by a decrease in waste paper and energy costs  as well as lower direct labor costs in converting and lower packaging costs 
these improvements were partially offset by higher converting 
table of contents overhead costs and higher depreciation expense 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved to in the period compared to in the period 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales was favorably affected by higher net sales prices  lower paper production costs  lower converting direct labor costs and lower packaging costs 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   a decrease of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs decreased primarily due to lower waste paper prices and  to a lesser extent  lower natural gas costs 
waste paper prices decreased significantly in the first half of following a strong run up in prices beginning during and peaking in early fourth quarter of beginning in july  our cost of waste paper has increased on a monthly basis through march our cost of waste paper in the year ended december  decreased approximately compared to our costs in as a result  our cost of waste paper decreased million in compared to direct labor costs in our converting operation in the year ended december  were lower than the same period in by on a per unit basis due to both the reduced headcount resulting from our automation project completed in the first quarter of and higher productivity 
the lower labor costs contributed approximately million to the increase in gross profit 
this cost reduction was partially offset by higher converting overhead costs 
converting overhead costs in the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to higher third party warehousing costs and higher salaried labor costs being partially offset by the absence of the productivity consultant expenses incurred in and lower maintenance and repair costs 
the costs of third party warehousing increased by  due to a full year of utilization in compared to a partial year in and due to higher inventory levels 
we began utilizing a third party warehouse in the first quarter of to increase our shipping capacity and provide better customer service to handle our increasing converting product shipments 
labor costs increased approximately  primarily due to additions to the operating team 
in  a productivity consultant was hired to assist our converting operations team in improving production efficiencies at a cost of  those costs were not repeated in maintenance and repair costs were lower in  compared to  by approximately  depreciation expense increased primarily due to the converting automation project and the waste water treatment project assets being placed in service during cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  our cost of sales were negatively affected by an increase in waste paper and energy costs as well as higher converting costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved to in compared to in cost of sales as a percent of net sales was favorably affected by higher net sales prices 
partially offsetting the net sales price improvement was higher paper production costs and higher converting costs 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   an increase of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs increased primarily due to higher waste paper prices and the higher cost of natural gas 
the prices we paid for waste paper increased approximately in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as a result  our cost of waste paper consumed increased approximately million 
waste paper prices began to decrease in the latter part of the fourth quarter of and had reduced by in december  compared to the prices paid in october  which was the highest price point in natural gas prices increased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  resulting in increased costs of approximately  our converting production costs increased primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs  which includes parts and service technicians  the cost of a productivity consultant and outside warehouse expense 
maintenance and repair costs increased approximately million in the year 
table of contents ended december  compared to the same period in late in the second quarter of through the end of the third quarter  we engaged a productivity consultant at a cost of  to assist our management team in their ongoing efforts to increase converting productivity 
the project included the design and implementation of a management operating system and assistance for our management team with the implementation of a new work schedule and work practices 
the project ended late in the third quarter 
as a result of these efforts  converting productivity from the beginning of september through february increased compared with the run rate experienced in the first eight months of we began leasing a third party warehouse late in the first quarter of  at a cost of approximately  in waste paper and natural gas costs began to abate somewhat during the fourth quarter of waste paper prices decreased slightly in november and to a greater extent in december 
by the end of december  waste paper prices had decreased approximately from their highest point in october gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the gross profit increase was associated with lower paper production costs mainly due to lower waste paper prices and  to a lesser extent  lower natural gas prices  lower converting direct labor  and lower packaging costs 
also  contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in converted product tonnage shipped as well as increased net selling prices 
as a result of our increased converting production  more tonnage was consumed in our converting operation rather than being sold as parent rolls 
this change in product mix positively affects our gross profit because sales of converted products typically carry a higher margin than sales of parent rolls 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved primarily due to the increase in net selling prices being partially offset by higher paper and converting costs cited above

see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to million in the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower libor rates and lower margins over libor attributable to our improved financial performance 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million a decrease of million compared to the same period in this decrease was attributable to lower libor interest rates  lower margins over libor reflecting the terms of our amended and restated credit agreement entered into in april and improved financial performance under our debt covenants since that time  as well as  the absence of interest of  on our subordinated debentures  which we retired in december  and decreased average outstanding bank borrowings 
other income was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the same period of the increase is due to interest income on the short term investments purchased primarily with the proceeds of the follow on stock offering in other income was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the same period of the decrease reflects the absence of interest income in the period as a result of eliminating the restricted certificate of deposit after the bank refinancing in april income before income taxes as a result of the foregoing factors  income before income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before income taxes increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  income tax provision for the year ended december   income tax expense amounted to million resulting in an effective tax rate of

contributing to the reduced tax burden for was the oitc associated with our investment in our new paper machine 
the iec  which was extended in october through december   also contributed to the reduced tax burden 
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
we completed the public offering primarily to help implement our strategy to eliminate our need at that time to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase and installation of a new paper machine 
the funding from the public offering  additional bank financing and cash flow from operations funded the million project 
as of december   we had cash on hand of million and million in short term investments  compared to  and as of december   respectively 
in the third quarter of  we completed a follow on stock offering that provided million in net proceeds 
the offering consisted of an initial sale of  shares of common stock on august  at an offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this portion of the offering  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
on september   the underwriter exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received million in net proceeds from this exercised option 
proceeds from the offering are intended primarily to fund a capital project intended to expand our converting capacity 
this project  which is estimated to cost million  is comprised of the construction of a new million warehouse and the purchase and installation of a new million converting line 
funding for the project will be provided by proceeds from the follow on offering  cash from operations and a construction loan on the warehouse portion of the project which will fund of the construction costs 
the proceeds from the follow on offering of million and cash generated from operations during the year ended december  of million allowed us to accelerate the implementation of our converting expansion project 
during  we made payments of approximately million towards equipment purchases and construction costs on our converting expansion project 
no amounts were borrowed on the warehouse construction loan as of december  in  we also generated sufficient cash to pay off the entire amount outstanding on our revolving credit line of million 
we estimate the state of oklahoma nol carryforward at million which is available to offset future state taxable income 
in addition  we plan to claim million in oitc carryforward as of december   which is available to offset future oklahoma income tax liability 
the oitc 
table of contents carryforward is expected to grow over the next three years as it is earned ratably over five years at two percent per year on qualified investments 
we expect to claim  in oitc in each of the next three years related to the new paper machine 
we will generate additional oitc from our investment in capital equipment that is part of our million expansion project  consisting of a new converting line and new warehouse 
the combination of accelerated depreciation deductions and the oitc will likely eliminate all oklahoma income tax liability for the next few years 
cash increased slightly to  at december  compared to  at december  we were able to generate sufficient cash during to fund million in capital expenditures  including a million converting automation project 
in  we generated sufficient cash during the first three quarters of to pay off all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
we used a cash build up in the fourth quarter and borrowings under our revolving credit line to retire all of our outstanding subordinated debentures in december totaling million 
in  our total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
capital expenditures related to the converting expansion project will be approximately million with the remainder going towards normal  recurring capital expenditures projects 
we expect normal recurring capital expenditures of approximately million per year 
the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million in an increase in cash earnings of million and an increase in deferred income tax expense were the main drivers 
cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  primarily due to million in net purchases of investment securities and million invested in capital equipment projects 
investments in short term securities was primarily the result of our follow on offering and  to a lesser extent  cash generated from operations 
capital project expenditures in were primarily comprised of million in payments for the initial order of our new converting line  million on the previously announced waste water treatments project  which was completed in  and million in progress payments on the construction of our new warehouse 
cash flows provided by financing activities was million in  primarily attributable to the million in proceeds from our follow on offering and to a lesser extent million for borrowings under our construction loan to complete the waste water treatment project 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million in normally scheduled principal payments on bank term loans as well as million payoff of the revolving credit line 
cash flows from operating activities increased  to million in an increase in cash earnings of approximately million was mostly offset by working capital changes in  particularly  increased accounts receivable and inventory levels of approximately million and the absence of the realization in of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and accounts receivable increased due to increased sales levels 
inventory increased due to higher levels of parent roll inventory and overall increased sales levels 

table of contents cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  primarily due to increased expenditures on capital projects of million 
of the total expenditures in  million was related to the previously announced million project to automate certain operations in our converting plant 
this project was completed in february and the remaining  of expenditures were incurred in the first quarter of cash flows used in financing was million in  primarily attributable to million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans which was partially offset by an approximate  increase in our revolving credit facility 
cash flows from operating activities in the year ended december   increased by million  to million  more than three times the amount reported for stronger earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  deferred taxes and stock option expense was the primary reason for the increase 
the realization of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and also contributed to the increased cash flow 
an increase in the level of business activity resulted in higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
cash flow used in investing activities in the year ended december  of  was for capital expenditures  mainly of maintenance projects 
offsetting these outflows was the release of the million restricted certificate of deposit in connection with the april refinancing of our bank debt 
cash flows used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to a million reduction in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans and the retirement of all of our subordinated debentures at a cost of million 
our april refinancing of our debt facility resulted in a net increase in funds of on april   we re financed our existing credit facility with the existing bank group 
the facility was amended from time to time 
following the amendments  the credit facility consists of the following at december  a million revolving credit facility outstanding at december   a million term loan a with a ten year term  no principal repayments for the first months and then amortized as if it had an year life million outstanding at december   a million term loan b with a four year term and is being amortized as if it had a six year life million outstanding at december   a million capital expenditures facility with a four year term that will be amortized as if it had a five year life outstanding at december   and a million construction loan with a seven year term  interest only payments through october   and then amortized as if it had a year life outstanding at december  
all loans are assessed at the same libor margins  and include a all in interest rate floor 
the interest rate is the higher of i the libor rate for the applicable interest period plus the margin  or ii per annum 
the margin is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income tax paid 
the margins range from to basis points over libor or daily floating libor 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a specific funded debt to ebitda ratio  debt service coverage ratio and an annual limit on unfunded 
table of contents capital expenditures 
the amount available under the revolving credit line may be reduced in the event that our borrowing base  which is based upon our qualified receivables and qualified inventory  is less than million 
as of december   our qualified receivables were million and our qualified inventory was million which yielded a total borrowing base of million and consequently the full million revolving credit facility was available to us 
obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  a covenant prohibiting us from declaring or paying dividends 
the financial covenants in the agreement require us to maintain specific ratios of funded debt to ebitda and debt service coverage which are tested as of the end of each quarter and places a limit on the amount of annual non financed capital expenditures 
the maximum allowable funded debt to ebitda ratio is to and the minimum allowable debt service coverage ratio is to the annual unfunded capital expenditures limit for will be million to allow for the completion of the converting expansion project and for years after  the annual limit will be million 
the construction loan is intended to fund of our warehouse expansion 
the project is in the construction phase 
if an event of default occurs  the agent may declare the banks obligation to make loans terminated and all outstanding indebtedness  and all other amounts payable under the credit agreement  due and payable 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were our long term debt and associated interest  natural gas contract  and expenditures related to the construction of our new warehouse and new converting line 
we do not have any leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans or any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 
maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years total and and after in thousands contractual cash obligations long term debt interest payments natural gas contract committed capital projects total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
these amounts assume interest payments at the year end borrowing amount 
the amount borrowed in future years is dependent on our free cash flow from time to time 
interest payments on the term loans have been calculated based on the interest rate in effect as of december  
table of contents in october  we entered into a contract to purchase  mmbtu per year of natural gas requirements at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management delivery fee for the period from april through march in november  we extended the contract to purchase  mmbtu at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management delivery fee for the period from april through march the amounts represent approximately of our natural gas requirements based on usage rates for if we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price  we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the volume purchased that was less than the contracted amount multiplied by the difference between our contract price and current spot price 
amounts committed to but not yet paid on the new converting line million and new warehouse million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off  net of recoveries  in the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
during the year ended december   we decreased the inventory valuation reserve by  during we increased the reserve by  the decrease in reserve in was due to a lower number of product content changes implemented in and in process as of december  the increase in the reserve in was due to the extensive changes in product content during the year and its resultant effect on the usability of raw materials 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
these provisions were effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted 
we began providing the related disclosures starting with our second quarter in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal this new guidance requires entities to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the enterprise is required to assess  on an ongoing basis  whether it is a primary beneficiary or has an implicit responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed 
this guidance changes the previous quantitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary to a qualitative approach based on which entity a has the power to direct activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact economic performance and b has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to the variable interest entity 
in addition  it requires enhanced disclosures that will provide investors with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity 
at this time  we have no variable interest entities as defined by the standard 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which established the fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities  and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and  subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
the guidance is not intended to change or alter existing gaap 
the guidance became effective for us in the fourth quarter of the guidance did not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
all references to previous numbering of fasb statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts have been removed from the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
non gaap discussion in addition to our gaap results  we also consider non gaap measures of our performance for a number of purposes 
we use ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity 
ebitda represents net income before net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for any of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital assets  
table of contents it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  it does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda on a supplemental basis 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the years ended december   and  years ended december  in thousands  except of net sales net income plus interest expense plus income tax expense plus depreciation ebitda of net sales ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in ebitda as a percent of net sales increased from in to in the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change

we use net debt as a supplemental measure of our leverage that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
net debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt  total liabilities or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap 
net debt represents total debt reduced by cash and short term investments 
we use this figure as a means to evaluate our ability to repay our indebtedness and to measure the risk of our financial structure 
net debt represents the amount that cash and cash equivalents is less than total debt of the company 
the amounts included in net debt calculation are derived from amounts included in the historical balance sheets 
we have reported net debt because we regularly review net debt as a measure of the company s leverage 
however  the net debt measure presented in this document may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components of the calculation 
net debt has decreased from million on december   to million on december  as a result of increases in our cash and short term investments primarily due to 
table of contents cash proceeds from our common stock offering of million as well as million in cash generated from operations

we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
our revolving line of credit and our term loans carry a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate borrowings of million 
the amounts outstanding under all loans bear interest at the same libor margins  and include a all in interest rate floor 
the interest rate is the higher of i the libor rate for the applicable interest period plus the margin  or ii per annum 
the margin is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income tax paid 
the margins range from to basis points over libor or daily floating libor 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it would be reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
based on the current borrowing  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a pre tax  increase to our annual interest expense 

table of contents commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of waste paper 
selling prices of tissue products are influenced by the market price of waste paper  which is determined by industry supply and demand 
the effect of a waste paper price increase of per ton would be approximately  per year 
as previously discussed under item a  risk factors  increases in waste paper prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments trail the increase in pulp prices 
natural gas price risk we are exposed to market risks for change in natural gas commodity pricing 
we partially mitigate this risk through our natural gas firm price contract that started in april and continues through march  for of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
the effect of a mmbtu increase on the not under firm price contract would be approximately  a year
