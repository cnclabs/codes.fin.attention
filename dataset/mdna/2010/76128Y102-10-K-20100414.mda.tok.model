we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
the discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
key financial measures in evaluating the results of operations  our management refers to a number of key financial and non financial measures relating to the performance of our business 
among our key financial measures are net sales  operating profit  and net income 
non financial measures that we use in evaluating our performance include number of stores and leased departments  net sales per average gross square foot for our stores and change in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year 
for fiscal and prior years  we considered comparable store sales to be sales at stores and leased departments that have been in operation for at least months at the beginning of the fiscal year 
stores and leased departments are excluded from the comparison in the quarter they close 
stores that are remodeled or relocated are excluded from the comparison if there is a material change in the size of the store or the location 
comparable store sales are also referred to as comp store sales by others within the retail industry 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our calculation of comparable store sales may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

table of contents we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon customer receipt of merchandise are net of returns and sales tax and are not recognized until collectability is reasonably assured 
for dsw 
com  we estimate a time lag for shipments to record revenue when the customer receives the goods 
we believe a one day change in our estimate would not materially impact our revenue 
net sales also include revenue from shipping and handling while the related costs are included in cost of sales 
revenue from gift cards is deferred and the revenue is recognized upon redemption of the gift card 
our policy is to recognize income from breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is remote 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we had accumulated enough historical data to recognize income from gift card breakage 
miscellaneous income is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we recognized million  million and million as other operating income from gift card breakage during fiscal  and  respectively  excluding discontinued operations 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the net realizable value  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns  which are reductions in prices due to customers perception of value 
accordingly  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  markdowns and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  and the resulting gross profit 
we record a reduction to inventories and charge to cost of sales for shrinkage 
shrinkage is calculated as a percentage of sales from the last physical inventory date 
our estimates are based on both our historical experience as well as recent physical inventory results 
physical inventory counts are taken on an annual basis and have supported our shrinkage estimates 
if our estimate of shrinkage  on a cost basis  were to increase or decrease as a percentage of net sales  it would result in approximately million decrease or increase to operating profit 
markdowns represent the excess of the carrying value over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of the inventory 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include customer preference and fashion trends 
changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
investments 
dsw s investments are valued using a market based approach using level and inputs 
dsw s equity investment is recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment using an income approach valuation model that uses level inputs such as the financial condition and future prospects of the entity 
dsw evaluates their investments for impairment and whether impairment is other than temporary 
in determining whether impairment has occurred  dsw reviews information about the underlying investment that is publicly available and assesses their ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
based on the nature of the impairment s  dsw would record temporary impairments as unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or other than temporary impairments in earnings 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
asset impairment and long lived assets 
we must periodically evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and finite life intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review to ascertain if any assets have been impaired 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows from the asset 
our reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level  which includes a store 
the impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value  based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by management 
any impairment loss realized is generally included in cost of sales 
we believe as of january  that the long lived assets carrying amounts and useful lives are appropriate 
we do not believe that there will be material changes in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate asset impairments 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 

table of contents self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
health and welfare estimates are calculated utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
workers compensation and general liability insurance estimates are calculated utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
we have purchased stop loss insurance to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per person basis for health and welfare and on a per claim basis for workers compensation and casualty insurance 
although we do not anticipate the amounts ultimately paid will differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
for example  for workers compensation and liability future claims estimates  a increase or decrease to the assumptions for claims costs and loss development factors would increase or decrease our self insurance accrual by approximately million 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plan are included in continuing operations at january  and in operations held for sale at january   and are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plan were a discount rate of and long term rate of return on plan assets of 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plan were a discount rate of and long term rate of return on plan assets of 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program for the dsw stores and dsw 
com in which program members earn reward certificates that result in discounts on future purchases 
upon reaching the target earned threshold  the members receive reward certificates for these discounts which expire six months after being issued 
we accrue the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase 
to estimate these costs  we are required to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates based on historical experience 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges under asc  changes in the fair values are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company uses the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of derivative instruments 
for fiscal years ended january  and january   the company recorded a non cash charge of million and a non cash reduction of expense of million  respectively  related to the change in fair value of warrants 
for fiscal years ended january  and january   the company recorded a non cash charge of million and a non cash reduction of expense of million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the conversion feature of the pies 
at january   if the estimated discount rate were to have increased by  the effect on the fair value of the warrants would have been million and would have decreased the fair value of the conversion feature of the pies by approximately million 
income taxes 
we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction in which we do business 
in making these estimates  we adjust income based on a determination of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if our management had made these determinations on a different basis  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  an increase in valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets was recorded 
during fiscal  a decrease in valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets was recorded 
following the completion of the dsw ipo in june  dsw is no longer included in retail ventures consolidated federal tax return

inflation and deflation our results of our operations and financial condition are generally presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation or deflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation or deflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition has been minor  however  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources retail ventures  inc relies on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and our cash on hand to meet our obligations  including our obligations under the pies and the guarantees of certain obligations of filene s basement and value city 
the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to retail ventures by way of dividends  distributions  interest or other payments including intercompany loans is subject to various restrictions  including restrictions imposed by the existing credit facility governing our subsidiaries indebtedness 
future indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries may also limit or prohibit such payments 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to make such payments may be limited by relevant provisions of the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization 
to the extent cash on hand is not sufficient to meet our operating cash flow needs we may seek other sources to provide the funds necessary for operations 
even though we could receive cash from dsw in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise  dsw has indicated that it does not intend to pay dividends in fiscal and rvi does not have a current arrangement for loans or other funding with dsw 
dsw is a separate and distinct legal entity and currently has no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to distribute cash to us or to make funds available to service our coupon payments under the pies 
retail ventures is continuing to review its available options to the extent it may become necessary to manage and enhance its liquidity position 
although rvi s plan to enhance liquidity could include  among other things  the sale or collateralization of shares of common stock of dsw inc or a sale of equity by rvi  no assurance can be given that any such transaction can be completed on favorable terms or that such a transaction would satisfy all of rvi s liquidity requirements 
on january   retail ventures sold to dsw  class b common shares  without par value  of dsw for an aggregate amount of million 
proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes and continuing expenses  however  this transaction will not eliminate rvi s need to continue to review available additional options to manage and enhance its liquidity 
dsw s primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store inventory purchases  capital expenditures in connection with store expansion  improving information systems  the remodeling of existing stores and infrastructure growth 
the primary sources of funds for these liquidity needs are cash flow from operations and credit facilities 
for dsw  their working capital and inventory levels typically build seasonally 
dsw believes that they have sufficient financial resources and access to financial resources at this time 
dsw is committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operations of the business  its growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility 
dsw believes that cash generated from dsw operations  together with its current levels of cash and equivalents and short term investments  as well as availability under its revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to maintain its ongoing operations  support seasonal working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures related to projected business growth 
except as noted  the following discussion is based upon the consolidated liquidity position of rvi 
see below under certain liquidity issues of rvi 

table of contents net working capital was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the increase in net working capital was primarily related to the increase in cash and short term investments as a result of operating cash flow and a planned inventory increase 
the increase in current assets was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable primarily related to the inventory increase  accrued bonus related to improved operating results and accrued taxes related to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
as of january  and january   the current ratio was and  respectively 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a million increase in income from continuing operations  after adjusting for non cash charges  and a million increase in the change in working capital assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to i a million increase from the non cash change in the fair value of derivative instruments  ii a million increase from the change in working capital assets and liabilities partially offset by iii the million decrease in income from continuing operations and the million decrease from the change in deferred income taxes and other non current liabilities 
investing activities for fiscal  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million compared to million for fiscal during the fiscal year ended january   million of cash was used to purchase available for sale and held to maturity securities while million of cash was generated by the sale of available for sale and held to maturity securities 
during fiscal  we incurred million in capital expenditures 
of this incurred amount  we incurred million related to stores  million related to supply chain projects and warehouses and million related to information technology and infrastructure 
for fiscal  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million compared to million for fiscal during the year ended january   million of cash was used to purchase available for sale and held to maturity securities while million of cash was generated by the sale of available for sale and held to maturity securities 
during fiscal  we had capital expenditures of million and payments on capital expenditures of million  including amounts accrued during fiscal of the fiscal capital expenditures  we incurred million for new stores and remodels of existing stores  million related to the warehouses  million related to dsw 
com and million related to information technology equipment upgrades and new systems  excluding dsw 
com 
dsw expects to spend approximately million for capital expenditures in fiscal dsw s future investments will depend heavily on the number of stores dsw opens and remodels  infrastructure and information technology programs that dsw undertakes and the timing of these expenditures 
in fiscal  dsw opened nine new stores 
dsw plans to open approximately stores in fiscal during fiscal  the average investment required to open a typical new dsw store was approximately million  prior to construction and tenant allowances 
of this amount  gross inventory typically accounted for million  fixtures and leasehold improvements typically accounted for million and new store advertising and other new store expenses typically accounted for million 
although continued expansion could place increased demands on dsw s financial  managerial  operational and administrative resources and result in increased demands on management  we do not believe that the anticipated growth plan will have an unfavorable impact on the operations or liquidity 
the current slowdown in the united states economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and consumer spending habits  which has resulted in further reductions in customer traffic and comparable store sales in existing stores with the resultant increase in inventory levels and markdowns 
reduced sales may result in reduced operating cash flows if dsw is not able to appropriately manage inventory levels or leverage expenses 
these negative economic conditions may also affect future profitability and may cause us to reduce the number of future store openings  impair goodwill or impair long lived assets 
financing activities during fiscal  cash provided by and used in financing activities by continuing operations was less than million compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  the cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the million cash used to repurchase a portion of the outstanding pies

rvi used the net proceeds of the offering to repay intercompany obligations to value city and for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of borrowings under a former credit facility guaranteed by rvi 
the embedded exchange feature of the pies is accounted for as a derivative  which is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value in the statement of operations 
accordingly  the accounting for the embedded derivative addresses the variations in the fair value of the obligation to settle the pies when the market value exceeds or is less than the threshold appreciation price 
the fair value of the conversion feature at the date of issuance of million was equal to the amount of the discount of the pies and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the pies

as of january  and january   the amount of rvi s guarantees of value city commitments was million and million  respectively 
the reduction in the liability through january  is due to payments by the primary obligor to the guaranteed party or information available indicating that it was not longer probable that the guaranteed liability would be incurred 
on october   value city filed for bankruptcy protection and announced that it would close its remaining stores 
rvi may become subject to risks associated with the bankruptcy filing by value city  if creditors whose obligations rvi has guaranteed are not paid 
to facilitate the change in ownership and operation of value city  retail ventures agreed to provide or arrange for the provision of certain transition services to value city for a period of one year unless otherwise extended by both parties 
we have negotiated an agreement with value city to continue to provide services post bankruptcy filing until the liquidation is complete  including risk management  financial services  benefits administration  payroll and information technology services  in exchange for a weekly payment

as of january   rvi has recorded a liability of million for the guarantees of filene s basement commitments  primarily for lease obligations 
on may   liquidating filene s basement filed for bankruptcy protection 
on june   following bankruptcy court approval  syms purchased certain assets of filene s basement 
the company negotiated with syms to provide transition services in exchange for payment 
on september   rvi and dsw entered into a settlement agreement with liquidating filene s basement and its related debtors and the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the chapter case for the debtors 
on november   the settlement agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
effective as of the court s approval  under the settlement agreement  rvi s claims in respect of million in notes receivable from liquidating filene s basement were released  rvi assumed the rights and obligations related to and agreed to indemnify liquidating filene s basement with regard to certain matters arising out of the liquidating filene s basement defined benefit pension plan  and liquidating filene s basement and the creditors committee agreed to allow certain general unsecured claims for amounts owed to rvi and dsw 
the parties also agreed to certain provisions affecting the proper allocation of proceeds paid to rvi or liquidating filene s basement in connection with specified third party litigation and to certain provisions related to the debtors recovery from third parties that are the beneficiaries of letters of credit or hold collateral related to workers compensation claims 
the settlement agreement also provides for certain mutual releases among the debtors  the creditors committee  rvi  dsw and other parties 
the foregoing description of the settlement agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the settlement agreement  which is filed herewith as exhibit and incorporated herein by reference 
although the settlement agreement provides that rvi and dsw will have certain allowed claims against liquidating filene s basement and its related debtors  there can be no assurance as to whether rvi or dsw will ultimately recover any additional amounts from the debtors in connection with these claims 
a plan of reorganization of the debtors was confirmed by the court on january   and an initial distribution from the debtors estates of million to rvi and million to dsw has been made 
however  there can be no assurance as to timing or the amount of any distribution in respect of rvi s or dsw s claims or whether rvi or dsw will recover any of the remainder of the amounts in connection with their claims 
failure to recover such amounts may negatively affect liquidity at rvi 
in addition  as a result of the releases provided by the settlement agreement  rvi and dsw have relinquished the right to pursue additional claims  which may include unknown or unmatured claims  against the debtors 
by assuming the liquidating filene s basement defined benefit pension plan  rvi has become responsible for maintaining this plan  and any contributions required to be made by rvi could negatively affect liquidity at rvi 
certain liquidity issues of rvi retail ventures is a holding company and all our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
rvi has no net sales on a standalone basis and rvi also does not have any credit facilities under which it can borrow funds 
therefore  we rely on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and our cash on hand to meet our obligations  including our obligations under the pies and the guarantees of certain obligations of filene s basement and value city 
the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to retail ventures by way of dividends  distributions  interest or other payments including intercompany loans is subject to various restrictions  including restrictions imposed by the existing credit facility governing our subsidiaries indebtedness 
future indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries may also limit or prohibit such payments 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to make such payments may be limited by relevant provisions of the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization 
to the extent cash on hand is not sufficient to meet our operating cash flow needs we may seek other sources to provide the funds necessary for operations 
even though we could receive cash from dsw in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise  dsw has indicated that it does not intend to pay dividends in fiscal and rvi does not have a current arrangement for loans or other funding with dsw 
dsw is a separate and distinct legal entity and currently has no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to distribute cash to us or to make funds available to service our coupon payments under the pies 
retail ventures is continuing to review its available options to the extent it may become necessary to manage and enhance its liquidity position 
although rvi s plan to enhance liquidity could include  among other things  the sale or collateralization of shares of common stock of dsw inc or a sale of equity by rvi  no assurance can be given that any such transaction can be completed on favorable terms or that such a transaction would satisfy all of rvi s liquidity requirements 
on january   retail ventures sold to dsw  class b common shares  without par value  for an aggregate amount of million 
proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes and continuing expenses  however  this transaction will not eliminate rvi s need to continue to review available additional options to manage and enhance its liquidity
