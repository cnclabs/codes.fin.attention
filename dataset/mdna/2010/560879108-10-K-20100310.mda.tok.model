item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging medical device company that markets our advanced robotic arm solution and orthopedic implants for minimally invasive orthopedic knee procedures 
we offer makoplasty  an innovative  restorative surgical solution that enables orthopedic surgeons to consistently  reproducibly and precisely treat patient specific  early to mid stage osteoarthritic knee disease 
in february  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the ticker symbol mako in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  or ipo 
through december   our recognized revenue was primarily generated from the sale of our implants and disposable products utilized in knee makoplasty procedures 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  upon the sale of our first generation tactile guidance system  or tgs  we deferred recognition of the related revenue and direct cost of revenue until delivery of the rio system  which is version of the tgs 
we commercially released the rio system in the first quarter of revenue for all previously deferred tgs sales was recognized in our statement of operations during the year ended december   upon delivery of the rio system 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses as we increase our sales and marketing activities and otherwise continue to invest capital in the development and expansion of our products and our business generally 
we also expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase due to additional operational and regulatory costs and burdens associated with the rapid expansion of our operations and operating as a public company 
recent key milestones in the development of our business include the following we commercially released our rio system in the first quarter of revenue for all previously deferred tgs sales was recognized in our statement of operations during the year ended december   upon delivery of the rio system 
in addition  we recognized the revenue and the direct cost of revenue from nineteen new unit sales of our rio system during the year ended december   bringing the total number of commercial rio systems to as of december  in the second quarter of  we commercially released our restoris mck multicompartmental knee implant system  or restoris mck  which enables surgeons to perform bicompartmental knee makoplasty procedures 
as of december   restoris mck bicompartmental knee makoplasty procedures were performed since the release of restoris mck 
during the year ended december   a total of  knee makoplasty procedures were performed  including unicompartmental and bicompartmental procedures  representing a increase over the year ended december  in september  we received k marketing clearance from the fda for an application that assists a surgeon in acetabular reaming during total hip arthroplasty using the rio system platform 
in february  we received k marketing clearance from the fda for an application that assists a surgeon in performing all components of a total hip arthroplasty using the rio system 
we believe these represent achievement of necessary milestones towards what we anticipate will be our continuing development and future commercialization of a rio enabled hip application 
we believe that the key to growing our near term business is expanding the acceptance and application of makoplasty to unicompartmental and multicompartmental knee resurfacing procedures by offering implants that address early to mid stage  unicompartmental and multicompartmental knee degeneration 
to successfully commercialize our products and grow our business  we must gain market acceptance for knee makoplasty 
factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a description of factors that may influence our future results of operations  including significant trends and challenges that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
revenue revenue is generated from unit sales of our rio systems  including installation services  training and upgrades and enhancements  from sales of implants and disposable products and sales of extended warranty service contracts 
through december   our recognized revenue was primarily generated from the sale of implants and disposable products utilized in knee makoplasty procedures 
for the year ended december   we also recognized revenue from sales of our rio systems in our statement of operations as described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section below 
future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to predict and we expect that it will only modestly reduce our continuing and increasing losses resulting from selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses and other activities for at least the next two or three years 
our future revenue may also be adversely affected by the current general economic downturn and the resulting tightening of the credit markets  which may cause purchasing decisions to be delayed or cause our customers to experience difficulties in securing adequate funding to buy our products 
the generation of recurring revenue through sales of our knee implants  disposable products and extended warranty service contracts is an important part of the makoplasty business model 
we anticipate that recurring revenue will constitute an increasing percentage of our total revenue as we leverage each new installation of our rio system to generate recurring sales of implants and disposable products and as we expand our implant product offering 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of rio systems  implants and disposable products for which revenue has been recognized or deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
costs associated with providing services are expensed as incurred 
cost of revenue also includes the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs  the cost associated with establishing at the time of installation an accrual for the rio system standard one year warranty liability  royalties related to the sale of products covered by licensing arrangements and write offs of obsolete or impaired inventory 
the direct cost of revenue associated with the sale of tgs units was deferred until the recognition of the related revenue 
the revenue and the direct cost of revenue for all previously deferred tgs sales was recognized in our statement of operations during the year ended december   upon delivery of the rio system 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation and benefits  for sales  marketing  clinical research  operations  regulatory  quality  executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
other significant expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing activities  marketing and advertising materials  insurance  professional fees for legal and accounting services  consulting fees  travel expenses  facility and related operating costs  and recruiting expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase due to the planned increase in the number of employees necessary to support the sales and marketing efforts associated with the growing commercialization of makoplasty  an increased number of employees necessary to support our continued growth in operations  and the additional operational and regulatory burdens and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
in addition  we are currently in the process of securing european union ce marking for the restoris mck onlay unicompartmental knee implant system  which is a legal requirement for medical devices intended for sale in europe  which may also increase our selling  general and administrative expenses  and we expect to incur additional costs associated with securing and protecting our intellectual property rights as necessary to support our future product offerings 
research and development expenses costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these costs include direct salary and benefit costs for research and development employees including stock based compensation  cost for materials used in research and development activities and costs for outside services 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities  including the support of existing products and the research of potential future products 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  impairment of long lived assets and the determination of stock based compensation 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
