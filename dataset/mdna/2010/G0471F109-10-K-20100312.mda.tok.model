item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused on south america  with operations in argentina and colombia 
as of december   we had interests in nine oil and gas producing concessions and one exploration permit in argentina  and two exploration and production contracts in colombia 
the global economic recession  resulting lower energy commodity price environment  and challenging financial markets during the past year have modestly impacted our results of operations  cash flow from operations and capital expenditures in compared to in relation to argentina  the global recession has negatively impacted economic conditions  lowering export revenues and capital inflows to the country  government revenues and tax collections have decreased  and the argentine peso has weakened 
however  drastically lower world prices for energy commodities in compared with has not had a material effect on our results of operations as oil prices in argentina have been artificially low compared to world market prices and price realizations have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range compared to other countries for several years 
nevertheless  anticipating any possible impact from potentially lower prices  our plan for was to focus on disciplined growth by reducing and optimizing capital expenditures and operating costs where appropriate 
although capital expenditures were reduced compared to the prior year  we continued to invest in our business with a focus on developing our core properties in the neuqu n basin  completing facility projects to allow for increased production in tierra del fuego  and maintaining a modest level of exploration activity 
during this period  we also continued a disciplined approach toward seeking investment opportunities to take advantage of our cash reserves and lack of long term debt in order to expand our presence in our core area in argentina and to enter new markets outside argentina to further position our company for future growth 

table of contents our investments of million in were primarily focused on our core areas in the neuqu n basin where we continued our track record of successful development and exploration drilling campaigns in entre lomas  bajada del palo and agua amarga 
additional highlights for include the following increased total consolidated and equity sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis by percent  obtained concession extensions for a portion of our properties from the province of neuqu n  declared commerciality on a portion of the agua amarga exploration permit  converting  acres into the charco del palenque year exploitation concession  completed additional flowlines and well connections to allow for increased natural gas production from our tierra del fuego concessions  and executed two farm in agreements in colombia 
for  net income attributable to apco oil and gas international inc was million compared with million for net income decreased compared with as the favorable effects of increased sales volumes and lower exploration expenses were more than offset by lower average oil and lpg sales prices  lower equity income from argentine investments  and greater income tax expense 
outlook for we believe we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities in our targeted areas as economic conditions improve and commodity prices strengthen 
the economic environment for the oil and gas industry improved in the second half of compared to earlier in the year 
in addition  economic and commodity price indicators for reflect continued improvement in the global economic environment 
product prices in argentina have modestly increased since the second quarter of and thus far in we cannot predict if this pricing trend will continue 
our plan for is structured around continued development in our core properties  adding to our presence in our region of the neuqu n basin  and completing the initial phases of our exploration projects in colombia 
accordingly  our specific objectives for the year are to obtain the ten year concession extensions for our properties in r o negro and tierra del fuego  re commence development drilling in our northwest and austral basin properties  complete seismic activities and commence exploration drilling before year end in colombia  and continue a disciplined approach toward seeking investment opportunities in both argentina and colombia 

table of contents our oil and gas capital expenditure budget including exploration expenditures is million net to our consolidated interests 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital expenditure budget including exploration expenditures for is million 
we expect the company and petrolera to have sufficient cash reserves and internally generated cash flows to fund these capital expenditures 
however  throughout the year  we will review our capital spending program in light of any changing economic conditions and  if necessary  will adjust our planned investments accordingly 
overview of business development as we have indicated since  our growth plans include diversification into countries outside of argentina 
consistent with this strategy  we increased the number of employees dedicated to our objective to build core areas in other parts of south america 
in  we opened a branch office to facilitate our efforts to search for opportunities in colombia 
in december  apco participated in a public bidding process known as anh miniround for the assignment of certain exploration properties by the government of colombia 
in  our shareholders approved a change in the name of our company from apco argentina inc to apco oil and gas international inc 
to further represent this evolution 
after extensively evaluating various investment opportunities  in we successfully executed farm in agreements to obtain significant interests in two exploration and production contracts covering approximately  acres in the llanos and middle magdalena basins in colombia 
both projects are being funded with internally generated cash 
in the llanos basin  we entered into a farm in agreement to earn a percent interest in the llanos exploration and production contract llanos 
the llanos block covers  acres in the llanos basin of western colombia 
apco agreed to fund approximately million or percent of exploration activities during a three year period ending in early to earn its percent non operated working interest 
the work commitments associated with llanos include the acquisition of at least square kilometers of d seismic and the drilling of at least two exploration wells 
in december  the partners commenced activities on llanos with a square kilometer d seismic acquisition program 
we expect to spend approximately million net to apco in for this seismic activity 
the program was designed to cover several leads already identified by the partners 
we expect that drilling activities will commence before the end of in the middle magdalena basin  we entered into a farm in agreement to earn a percent working interest in the turpial exploration and production contract turpial 
the farm in is subject to governmental approval 
turpial covers  acres of underexplored area between the velazquez and cocorna oil fields in the basin 
under the farm in agreement  apco reimbursed the operator of the block million in december for a portion of its first phase sunk costs and agreed to carry second phase expenditures up to million in order to earn its working interest 
during the partners plan to comply with second phase work commitments by extending seismic coverage in the northern area of turpial with kilometers  or approximately  acres  of additional d seismic 
we expect to spend approximately million related to this commitment in subsequent event in february  we entered into a farm in agreement that allows us to acquire  through a drill to earn structure  up to a percent net interest in the coir n amargo exploration permit in the neuqu n basin 
the coir n amargo block covers approximately  acres and is adjacent to our bajada del palo and entre lomas concessions and close to our agua amarga exploration permit 
roch sa  the operator of our austral basin properties  is a partner in and the operator of the coir n amargo block 
although this agreement in coir n amargo is outside of our joint ventures with petrolera  this growth opportunity leverages apco s experience gained through exploring and developing in the region for over forty years 

table of contents under the agreement  apco will earn a percent non operated interest for funding the drilling of two exploration wells during after drilling the first two wells  apco will have an option to proceed to a second phase and drill two additional wells during the latter part of and in enabling us to increase our interest to percent 
additionally  by drilling the two wells in the second phase we will earn a percent interest in a discovery well previously drilled by the partners under the commitments of the exploration permit 
we expect to spend between million to million under this agreement in  depending on our determination to proceed to a second phase 
should we proceed to the second phase  we expect to spend an additional million in neuqu n basin properties our core properties in the neuqu n basin continue to produce solid results 
although the joint venture partners reduced capital expenditures in the areas during compared to  we continued to employ a prudent mix of development and exploration capital to be able to grow our business 
additionally  a significant accomplishment for the year was extending a portion of the productive lives of our assets in the basin 
we obtained ten year extensions for the bajada del palo concession and the portion of the entre lomas concession located in the province of neuqu n 
the bajada del palo concession was extended to september  and the entre lomas concession was extended to january we also declared commerciality on a portion of the agua amarga exploration permit  converting approximately  acres into the charco del palenque exploitation concession with a year term and a five year optional extension period 
apco and its partners used two rigs throughout to drill gross development wells and six exploration wells in the areas 
all wells were successful 
total gross capital and exploration expenditures was million for the year  or million net to our percent direct working interest and million attributable to our equity interest in petrolera 
additionally  the partners drilled our first horizontal well in the bajada del palo concession  where we believe additional horizontal wells can be drilled in order to maximize production rates and ultimate recovery of reserves 
we have a percent direct working interest and an effective percent equity interest in the wells mentioned above 
concession contracts in argentina in  the province of neuqu n established minimum requirements and an estimated timetable for concession holders to negotiate their respective concession extensions 
the basic requirements included negotiation of a cash bonus payment  an increase to provincial production taxes  and a future investment program 
in july of  petrolera concluded the formal negotiation process with the province of neuqu n on behalf of the entre lomas and bajada del palo joint venture partners 
terms of the agreement include a total bonus of million million net to our direct working interest  payable in installments over months commencing in july provincial production taxes were increased from the previous rate of percent to percent and could increase up to a maximum of percent depending on future increases in product price realizations 
the partners also agreed to spend million gross million net to our direct working interest for future exploitation and exploration activities in the portion of entre lomas located in neuqu n province and in bajada del palo over a year period 

table of contents for the portion of the entre lomas concession located in the province of r o negro  similar negotiations have begun with the provincial government in although we hope those negotiations can be concluded in  we cannot predict when they will be achieved nor the final terms that may be negotiated 
executive and legislative approvals will be required 
the tierra del fuego concessions partners have held preliminary discussions with the province of tierra del fuego regarding the extension of our three concessions  but the province has not formally initiated a process similar to that conducted by the province of neuqu n 
oil and natural gas marketing oil prices oil prices have a significant impact on our ability to generate earnings  fund capital projects  and pay shareholder dividends 
oil prices are affected by changes in market demands  global economic activity  political events  weather  inventory storage levels  refinery infrastructure capacity  opec production quotas  and other factors 
additionally  oil sales price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions as described in the following paragraphs 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future prices  and therefore it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in product prices may have on our capital programs  production volumes  or future revenues 
historically  the price per barrel for argentine crude oil was based on the spot market price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti less a discount for differences in gravity and quality 
in the wake of the argentine economic crises of  and as the price of crude oil increased to record levels over the past several years  politically driven mechanisms were implemented to determine the sale price of oil produced and sold in argentina 
to alleviate the impact of higher crude oil prices on argentina s economy  the argentine government created an oil export tax and enacted strict price controls over gasoline prices to force producers and refiners to negotiate oil sales prices significantly below international market levels 
in response to those governmental actions over the last several years  argentine producers and refiners had to negotiate domestic oil sale prices that take into consideration both net backs for oil exported from argentina and the cost of feedstock to refiners in light of gasoline price controls 
consequently  apco has not benefited from increases in world oil prices over the past several years as have producers outside of argentina 
the years and have been unique for world oil prices as the spot price of wti reached a peak of per barrel in july  then approached a low of per barrel in december and have fluctuated throughout this volatility of world oil prices has not been reflected in our results of operations during and due to the price controls and marketing environment in argentina 
our oil sales price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged for compared with for and in as a result of the level of oil sale prices in argentina when compared with oil sales prices in other countries  oil exploration investments and consequent oil discoveries in argentina have not been sufficient to replace domestic production 
consequently  oil reserves in the country have been dropping in recent years 
we cannot predict how world oil prices will evolve in and beyond or what additional actions the argentine government will take in response to either future fluctuations in world oil prices or the drop in the level of the country s oil reserves 

table of contents natural gas prices we sell our natural gas to argentine customers pursuant to peso denominated contracts and spot market sales 
as a consequence of the strong growth in argentina s economy over the past several years  and stimulated by low natural gas prices resulting from a price freeze implemented by the argentine government in  demand for natural gas in argentina has grown significantly 
however  the unfavorable price environment for producers has acted to discourage natural gas development activities 
without significant development of natural gas reserves in argentina  the supply of natural gas has failed to keep up with increased demand 
the result is a natural gas and power supply shortage in the country 
since  the argentine government has taken several steps to prevent shortages in the domestic market 
natural gas exports to chile were suspended and the country began importing natural gas from bolivia at significantly greater prices than sales prices for natural gas produced in argentina  and was forced to import high priced lng 
as described in the following paragraphs  resolution is designed to supply natural gas in the domestic market and provide a framework for natural gas prices in argentina 
in  the argentine secretary of energy issued resolution to regulate the supply of natural gas in the domestic market for the period to through a natural gas supply agreement referred to as the acuerdo the resolution is intended to provide for equitable sharing of all sectors of the internal natural gas market among producers and establishes a mechanism for doing so based on average natural gas volumes produced from to the resolution determines which sectors of the market will have priority during periods of peak demand 
during peak periods  the residential market will have first priority 
with respect to the lower priced residential market  each producer s share of the residential market will be distributed based on an allocation of its volumes produced during the period to  while natural gas production in excess of those volumes can be sold to electric power generators at regulated prices  and industrial customers at freely negotiated prices 
producers that increased natural gas production since have an advantage compared to those producers whose production decreased because natural gas prices to residential customers remain frozen at less than cents per mcf 
the resolution allows producers to choose to participate in the acuerdo natural gas supply agreement or not 
however  if a producer chooses not to participate  then during periods of peak demand  or when there is a shortage of natural gas in the country  the government can force non participating producers to be the first to supply excess residential volume demand above the base line demand as projected in the acuerdo  regardless of the non participating producer s contractual commitments 
in general  resolution has had a slightly positive impact on natural gas sales prices in acambuco and tierra del fuego  but  during peak demand periods  it has lowered natural gas sales prices in entre lomas 
nevertheless  because natural gas revenues from entre lomas represent approximately three percent of our total operating revenues on an annual basis  the overall impact of the resolution is not expected to be material to our cash flows or results of operations 
our average natural gas sale price per mcf  averaged in  in  and during the level of gas reserves in argentina has been dropping in recent years in a country that is highly dependent on natural gas as a source of energy 
given the government s tendency to intervene over pricing of a commodity in such high demand  we cannot predict how argentine natural gas prices will evolve in and beyond or whether the current argentine government will continue to maintain tight controls over prices or decide to loosen price controls in response to falling reserves 

table of contents seasonality of the products we sell  only natural gas is subject to seasonal demand 
demand for natural gas in argentina is reduced during the warmer months of october through april  with generally lower natural gas prices during this off peak period 
during  natural gas sales represented percent of our total operating revenues compared with percent in and percent in consequently  the fluctuation in natural gas sales between summer and winter is not significant for the company 
new accounting standards and emerging issues accounting standards that have been issued and are not yet effective may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
see accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these and other recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that these particular estimates and assumptions are critical due to their subjective nature and inherent uncertainties  the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the following accounting estimates and assumptions as well as related disclosures with our audit committee 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas information in this report on form k are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by gaap and by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the reserve engineers and geologists that prepare the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by its reserve engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing  and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the company s proved reserves are limited to the concession life 
certain of our existing concession terms can be extended for years with the consent of the argentine government 
the extension of our concessions could materially affect the company s estimate of proved reserves 
the present value of future net cash flows should not be assumed to be the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price received for the period january through december with the most current cost information 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depreciation expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of oil and gas producing properties for impairment 

table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our proved properties for impairment on a concession by concession basis and recognizes an impairment whenever events or circumstances  such as declining oil and gas prices  indicate that a property s carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating future net revenues  we assume costs will escalate annually and apply an oil and gas price forecast that we believe to be reasonable 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and governmental regulations in argentina  it is possible that the our assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future 
however  at prices equivalent to those at year end  we do not expect to recognize any impairments in the near term 
we could  depending upon the results of exploration  determine that some or all of our interests in unproved areas need to be impaired as we drill and evaluate certain of these areas in future periods 
contingent liabilities we record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies  including environmental matters  when we assess that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are generally reflected in income when new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and estimates and upon advice of legal counsel  engineers  or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
as new developments occur or more information becomes available  our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities may change 
changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different from our current assumptions and estimates could materially affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period

successful drilling in our neuqu n basin properties and increased condensate production in our austal basin properties were the primary drivers of higher sales volumes 
however  the benefit of greater sales volumes was offset by a six percent decrease in average oil sales prices which resulted in a million decrease in revenues

table of contents vs 
during  oil revenues increased by million  or percent compared with for the year  the increase in oil revenues was evenly split between higher sales prices and increased volumes 
initial field re activation activities in bajada del palo and successful drilling in our neuqu n basin properties resulted in greater sales volumes during the natural gas revenues vs 
during  natural gas revenues increased by million  or percent compared with production facility enhancements and well connections in our tierra del fuego operations drove a percent increase in consolidated natural gas sales volumes for the year  resulting in a million benefit to revenues 
additionally  a percent increase in average natural gas sales prices resulted in a million increase in revenues for the year 
higher average natural gas sales prices are primarily attributable to a gas sales contract allowing for a portion of our tierra del fuego production volumes to be delivered to higher priced industrial markets 
in addition  the argentine government allowed natural gas sales prices in low priced residential markets to increase from approximately per mcf to per mcf beginning in the third quarter for further explanation of natural gas sales prices in argentina  please read the section oil and natural gas marketing natural gas prices  previously discussed in md a 
lpg revenues vs 
lpg revenues decreased by million in  or percent compared with  as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower prices 
in  decreased international commodity prices and market conditions in argentina resulted in a percent decrease in average lpg sales prices  which decreased revenues by million 
other operating revenues vs 
other operating revenues increased by thousand during compared with the majority of our other operating revenues relates to value added tax collections related to hydrocarbon sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 
for oil  natural gas  and lpg that is produced on the island of tierra del fuego and sold domestically to continental argentina  sellers are allowed to retain the value added tax collected from buyers as part of the island s tax exemption rules 
this mechanism effectively increases our realized prices by percent for sales made to the continent 
as a result  fluctuations in our ot her operating revenues are driven by sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 
vs 
other operating revenues increased by thousand during compared with due to greater amounts of value added tax collections resulting from increased sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 
total costs and operating expenses vs 
total costs and operating expenses decreased by thousand due to certain offsetting variances 
specifically  lower exploration expense offset increases in certain operating costs as follows exploration expense decreased by million due to the absence of dry hole expense for unsuccessful exploratory wells and lower exploration activity including acquiring less amounts of d seismic information  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased by million  or percent primarily due to increased volumes 
see below for a more detailed discussion of dd a expense  and 
table of contents selling and administrative expense increased by million due to higher business development activity reflecting management s strategy to search for and evaluate growth opportunities and increased salaries and wages 
vs 
total costs and operating expenses increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the following factors production and lifting costs increased by million  or percent due to higher volumes of oil and total fluid volumes lifted and an increase in the number of producing wells in entre lomas and tierra del fuego resulting from drilling activities 
we also incurred greater well service expenses  increased facility maintenance costs  and higher electricity expense 
in addition  we experienced an increase of million for incurring a full year s expenses related to bajada del palo and agua amarga both of which commenced activities during  exploration expense is greater by million reflecting an increase of million due to the acquisition of greater amounts of d seismic and other geological and geophysical costs  and an increase of million in dry hole expense as a result of drilling more exploration wells outside of our core areas  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or percent primarily due to increased unit rates 
see below for a more detailed discussion of dd a expense  selling and administrative expense increased by million due to higher business development activity reflecting management s strategy to search for and evaluate growth opportunities  increased staffing in our buenos aires office  increased salaries and wages in response to trending higher compensation levels in the industry  and greater administrative expenses charged by our joint venture operators  depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses dd a our dd a expense is based on the units of production method  which in basic terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved developed reserves produced each period times the net carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties 
our proved developed reserves are limited to an area s concession life even though a concession s term can be extended for years with the consent of the argentine government 
in the third quarter of  the terms for a portion of our concessions were extended until and the extensions have had a favorable effect on our average dd a rates beginning in the third quarter of compared with prior periods as more proved producing reserves are included in our dd a calculation  resulting in a lowering of the dd a rate for those concessions

dd a increased by million in compared with as seen in the table above  the majority of the increase in dd a expense was due to greater volumes  which is contrary to our historical trend 
although our dd a rate increased for the year  in our year over year dd a rate increased at a decelerating rate  or was only two percent greater than it was in  which is a significantly lower rate compared with previous years including the percent increase we experienced in various factors contributed to this deceleration of increased dd a rates we have experienced  including the previously mentioned concession extensions  the increased proportion of sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basi s due to greater natural gas sales volumes from our tierra del fuego concessions which lowers our weighted average dd a rate  and increased proved reserves from successful drilling in our neuqu n basin properties 
vs 
dd a increased by million in compared with primarily due to increased dd a rates 
during  the increase in our dd a rate was primarily a function of adding less proved reserves per well drilled per year as we approached the end of the primary terms of our concessions 
investment income vs 
in  our total investment income decreased by million  or percent  primarily due to a million decrease in equity income from argentine investments 
the decrease in our equity income is due to a decrease in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera 
the comparative decrease in petrolera s net income is a result of lower oil and lpg sales prices and increased depreciation expense 
these two factors more than offset the benefits of greater oil sales volumes attributable to successful exploration and development drilling in our joint operations in the neuqu n basin 
additionally  interest and other income decreased by thousand compared to due to lower yields on our financial investments and lower balances of cash equivalents 
vs 
in  total investment income decreased by million primarily due to a million decrease in equity income from argentine investments 
the decrease in our equity income is due to a decrease in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera 
the comparative decrease in petrolera s net income is a result of higher operating costs and depreciation expense attributable to operations in entre lomas 
additionally  petrolera incurred a full year of operating and exploration expenses in associated with the bajada del palo concession and the agua amarga exploration permit both of which were acquired in petrolera s incom e was also impacted by a full year of interest expense on borrowings from its line of credit that was established in the second half of income taxes vs 
income taxes increased by million compared to although our income before income taxes is only two percent higher in compared with  the effective tax rate for the period increased due to higher non deductible costs including greater foreign exchange losses and higher general and administrative expenses in our home office  lower interest and other income which is not subject to income tax  lower equity earnings from argentine investments which is recorded on an after tax basis  and exploration expenses incurred in colombia which are not deductible until we generate revenues in that country 

table of contents vs 
income taxes decreased by million compared to due to lower taxable income in argentina compared with liquidity and capital resources cash flow analysis we have historically funded capital programs and past property acquisitions with internally generated cash flow 
our direct participation in the entre lomas concession and dividends from our equity interest in petrolera continue to be the largest contributors to our net cash provided by operating activities 
we have not relied on debt or equity as sources of capital due to the turmoil that periodically affects argentina s economy which makes financing difficult to obtain at reasonable terms 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents and no bank debt 
as previously discussed in md a  world oil prices were sharply lower in compared to record highs in oil price realizations in argentina were also lower  though not as drastically due to governmental price controls in place 
anticipating any further deterioration in prices  and with increasing investment opportunities to grow our company  we lowered shareholder dividends in second quarter we will continue to monitor our capital programs and the quarterly shareholder dividend as necessary to preserve cash in response to changing economic conditions to provide apco with the financial resources and liquidity needed to continue development drilling in its core properties over the long term  meet work commitment obligations  fund new investment opportunities  meet future working capital needs and fund any further cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions  if any  while maintaining sufficient liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 
in  petrolera arranged for a million bank line of credit to fund its share of the acquisition cost for the bajada del palo concession and a portion of its capital expenditures 
as of december   petrolera borrowed the full million thereby using the entire line of credit with the bank 
in may  an amendment to the initial agreement was made whereby the unpaid principal amount of the line of credit  or million as of that date  was consolidated into one loan of million 
the consolidated loan will be paid in quarterly installments starting in first quarter  and interest will be paid quarterly at libor plus a year 
petrolera s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon numerous factors  including its cash flows provided by its operating activities  levels of capital spending  changes in crude oil and natural gas prices  and debt and interest payments 
due to increased capital spending for development and exploration activities in our neuqu n basin properties and petrolera s scheduled principal and interest payments  we expect to receive less dividends from petrolera during the next four years compared with dividends paid over the past three years 

table of contents as previously described  we ended with cash and cash equivalents of million  representing a decrease of million during the year 
the following table summarizes the change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown 
sources uses of cash years ended december  thousands net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by thousand compared with primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
additionally  apco received million in dividends from its argentine investment in petrolera  compared with million in and million in investing activities during  we spent million for capital expenditures  including million primarily related to development and exploration drilling  and million as acquisition cost related to our entrance into colombia 
additionally  million was invested as collateral for a letter of credit for investments in colombia 
we expect to fulfill those investments before january  at which time the collateral will no longer be required 
during  we spent a record level of capital expenditures  or million

after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital expenditure budget including exploration expenditures for is million 
we expect the company and petrolera to have sufficient internally generated cash flows to fund our investment programs 
as previously mentioned  throughout we will review our capital program considering developing circumstances in the world economy and changing energy markets and will adjust capital spending accordingly

as described elsewhere in this report  during the terms of portions of our concessions located in the province of neuqu n were extended for an additional years 
as a result of the extensions  we also agreed to make expenditures for oil and gas activities net to our direct working interest of approximately million during the three year period ending december   million during the three year period ending december   and million between and we expect to fund these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks as a result of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity price risk the company has historically not used derivatives to hedge price volatility 
as previously mentioned in md a  oil sales price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions 
in the current regulatory environment  the combination of hydrocarbon export taxes and strict government controls over argentine gasoline prices directly impacts net backs for the sale of crude oil in the domestic argentine market 
as a result  our price is impacted more by government controls than changes in world oil prices and our netbacks have not been responsive to fluctuations in world oil prices 
therefore  we cannot accurately predict our future sales prices  and it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in world oil prices may have on our results of operation s 
our oil sales price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged during and in during  when the per barrel price of wti peaked at in july and fell to nearly in december  our average price was 
table of contents foreign currency and operations risk devaluation and inflation are linked 
devaluation of a country s currency in comparison to other world currencies is generally the result of greater inflation levels in that country relative to other countries 
the majority of the company s operations and all of its current production is located in argentina which has had a history of high levels of inflation and resultant currency devaluation 
therefore  the company s financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions  or changes in argentina s political climate 
during and  the company recorded sizeable foreign currency exchange losses due to the significant devaluation of the argentine peso that occurred as a consequence of argentina s economic problems during and since  the argentine government has used monetary policies to keep the peso to us dollar exchange rate stable at approximately fluctuations in the peso to us dollar exchange rate generally impact us in two ways 
the us dollar value of peso denominated financial assets and liabilities fluctuate with changes in the value of the argentine peso 
if the company has positive net working capital denominated in pesos  a devaluation of the peso will reduce the us dollar value of that net working capital generating a foreign exchange loss 
in the same scenario  a negative net working capital balance would generate a foreign exchange gain 
fluctuations in the peso to us dollar exchange rate also impact the dollar value of our gas revenues and expenses incurred in argentina 
a portion of our natural gas is priced in pesos and a significant portion of our operating expense and the general and administrative expenses we incur in argentina are peso denominated costs 
o il is priced in us dollars  hence  the value of oil revenues is only subject to currency fluctuations during the period our sales invoices remain outstanding 
a devaluation of the peso reduces our gas revenues and peso denominated costs 
however  local governments can use monetary policy to control devaluation even in an environment of high inflation in the country and they generally do 
argentina s central bank has historically intervened to control exchange rates 
as stated above  it has used monetary policy to stabilize argentina s peso to us dollar exchange rate during periods of high inflation 
over the last several years  we have experienced a sharp increase in our peso denominated production and lifting costs in great part due to local inflation without a corresponding level of devaluation 
history demonstrates that because of government intervention  inflation and devaluation rarely move in tandem  rather they move in cycles 
so  after an extended period of inflation without corresponding devaluation  a sudden sharp devaluation will occur in order to complete the cycle 
such a sudden devaluation will impact the company in the manner previously described 
at december  the peso to us dollar exchange rate was argentine economic and political environment during the decade of the s  argentina s government pursued free market policies  including the privatization of state owned companies  deregulation of the oil and gas industry  tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors  liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of exchange controls 
the cornerstone of these reforms was the convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar 
these policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial economic growth during the early to mid s 
however  throughout the decade  the argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget  incurring repeated significant fiscal deficits that by the end of resulted in the accumulation of billion of debt 
the government subsequently defaulted on a significant portion of its debt in early 
table of contents in january  the national congress passed emergency law  which  among other things  overturned the convertibility plan 
the government subsequently adopted a floating exchange rate 
the emergency law directly impacted the company by establishing a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports effective april  in addition the government implemented strict controls over the price of natural gas including the freezing prices for residential consumption 
the abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in a strong devaluation of the peso 
by september   the peso to us dollar exchange rate had increased from to argentina s economy has since shown signs of stabilization with economic conditions improving considerably growing at an average annual rate of eight percent until as a commodity exporter  the country benefited from increases in the price of its agricultural and natural resource exports such as crude oil  generating surpluses in both argentina s international trade balance and the government s fiscal balance 
the government  when possible  took advantage of this environment by increasing certain taxes  such as the oil export tax in order to increase its tot al tax revenues and improve its fiscal balance 
over the last several years  the government has implemented various price control mechanisms in order to control inflation across many sectors of the economy 
in order to shield the argentine consumer from inflation  the government has implemented price controls over oil  diesel  gasoline and natural gas and imposed greater export taxes that result in lower energy prices in the country 
these price controls together with higher taxes impacted the balance of supply and demand for hydrocarbons leading to energy shortages which exist today in argentina and have created less favorable conditions for energy companies doing business in the country 
given the recent world economic crisis and economic contraction  demand for argentine exports fell off significantly and argentina s economy began to contract 
the reduction in economic activi ty in the country has reduced the previously described energy shortages in argentina 
in late  a sharp drop in world commodity prices  including oil and agricultural products  has strained argentina s economy 
sharply reduced exports resulted in reduced government export revenues and negatively impacted the country s fiscal balance 
argentina continues to suffer from inflation and in little to no economic growth 
cristina kirchner  wife of former president nestor kirchner  was elected president in december her term runs through november she has essentially pursued the same policies as her predecessor 
mrs 
kirchner s party lost the mid term congressional elections in  losing control of both houses of congress 
we cannot predict how the government will react to the present economic and political situation or what government policies will be implemented by this administration or any future administration or what government actions will impact the country s energy sector and the company in particular
